# Doorway Staging Read Replicas — Projection Readers
#
# Full doorway instances with PROJECTION_WRITER=false.
# Read from shared MongoDB projection, know the conductor pool,
# serve all read-heavy routes. The only difference from the writer
# is: no signal subscriber, no doorway-app sidecar.
#
# Every replica is a full doorway — it can query conductors,
# serve blobs, answer /admin/conductors, and handle cache reads.
#
# Architecture:
#   Ingress (read-heavy paths) -> read replica Service -> these pods
#   All pods share: same MongoDB, same CONDUCTOR_URLS, same STORAGE_URL
