# Shared target directory for all Rust projects in holochain/
# This saves disk space and speeds up builds by sharing compiled dependencies
#
# How it works:
# 1. This config tells cargo to output to holochain/target/ (relative path)
# 2. Symlinks in each dna/* directory point target -> ../../target
# 3. dna.yaml files use relative paths like "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/..."
# 4. These paths resolve correctly via the symlinks
#
# CI compatibility: The relative path works in any workspace location
