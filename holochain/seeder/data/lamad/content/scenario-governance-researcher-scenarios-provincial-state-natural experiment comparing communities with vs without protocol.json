  "content": "Scenario: Natural experiment comparing communities with vs without protocol\n    Given some adjacent communities adopted protocol while neighbors didn't\n    And these communities are similar in demographics and economics\n    When I study outcomes comparing adopters to non-adopters\n    Then I isolate: protocol effects from confounding factors\n    And I measure: differences in wellbeing, crisis response, social cohesion\n    And I examine: spillover effects across community boundaries\n    And I analyze: why some communities adopted and others resisted\n    And I provide: quasi-experimental evidence about causality\n    And My findings distinguish: correlation from causation in protocol effects\n    And Evidence serves policymakers deciding whether to support adoption\n",
