  "content": "Scenario: Accessing appeals process without technical expertise\n    Given I am not tech-savvy and don't understand AI systems well\n    And an agent decision has affected me in a way I disagree with\n    When I want to file an appeal\n    Then I can trigger the appeal with a simple button: \"I disagree with this decision\"\n    And I can state my complaint in plain language without legal jargon\n    And I don't need a lawyer or technical knowledge to participate\n    And The interface guides me through the process step-by-step\n    And Support is available in my language and accessible format\n    And The process respects my dignity regardless of my technical literacy\n",
