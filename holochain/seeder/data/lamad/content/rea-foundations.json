  "content": "# REA: The Accounting Model That Sees Value\n\n## What is REA?\n\nREA (Resources, Events, Agents) is an accounting framework developed by William McCarthy in 1982 that tracks **actual value flows** rather than monetary abstractions.\n\nTraditional double-entry bookkeeping asks: \"What accounts changed?\"\nREA asks: \"What happened? Who was involved? What was transformed?\"\n\n## The Three Core Elements\n\n### Resources\nThings of economic value that can be:\n- **Consumed** (used up in a process)\n- **Produced** (created through work)\n- **Transferred** (moved between agents)\n- **Used** (applied without consumption)\n\nResources include: time, skills, materials, care, attention, knowledge, environmental capacity.\n\n### Events\nEconomic happenings that transform resources:\n- A nurse stabilizes a patient (care event)\n- A repair tech fixes a laptop (production event)\n- A teacher explains a concept (knowledge transfer event)\n- A parent prepares a meal (care work event)\n\nEvents are **observable** and **recorded** - they happened, someone saw them.\n\n### Agents\nThe economic actors who participate in events:\n- **Providers**: Those who give resources\n- **Receivers**: Those who receive resources\n- **Witnesses**: Those who observe and validate\n\n## Why REA Matters for Care Economies\n\nTraditional accounting is **value-blind**:\n- A dollar from exploitation equals a dollar from care\n- Invisible labor isn't counted\n- Environmental costs are externalized\n\nREA accounting is **value-aware**:\n- Every resource transformation is recorded\n- Care work becomes visible\n- All contributions can be recognized\n\n## The REA Event Structure\n\n```\nEVENT: Emergency_Care_2024\n├── Resources Consumed:\n│   ├── Nurse time: 47 minutes\n│   ├── Medical supplies: IV kit\n│   └── Emotional labor: high intensity\n├── Resources Created:\n│   ├── Patient stability: restored\n│   ├── Family peace: anxiety → hope\n│   └── Junior nurse learning: witnessed\n└── Agents:\n    ├── Provider: Nurse Adaeze\n    ├── Receiver: Patient\n    └── Witnesses: 2 junior nurses\n```\n\nThis is the foundation of economic visibility.",
