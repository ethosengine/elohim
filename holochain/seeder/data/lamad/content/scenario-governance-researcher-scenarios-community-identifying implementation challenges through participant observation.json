  "content": "Scenario: Identifying implementation challenges through participant observation\n    Given I am embedded in Riverside for six months\n    And I observe daily reality of protocol implementation\n    When I encounter challenges residents and leaders face\n    Then I document: elderly residents struggling with technology\n    And I note: three Constitutional Council decisions that residents opposed\n    And I observe: recurring tension around adolescent autonomy\n    And I identify: gaps between theory and practice\n    And I analyze: what enables some communities to thrive while others struggle\n    And My research reveals: practical wisdom about implementation\n    And Findings help other communities avoid pitfalls Riverside encountered\n",
