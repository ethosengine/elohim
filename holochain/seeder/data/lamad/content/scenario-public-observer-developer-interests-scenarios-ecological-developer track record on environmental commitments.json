  "content": "Scenario: Developer track record on environmental commitments\n    Given a developer promised tree preservation in previous projects\n    And claimed environmental mitigation would offset impacts\n    When the Observer tracks environmental commitment delivery\n    Then analysis shows: 67% of preserved trees died within two years\n    And mitigation site was not maintained as required\n    And environmental monitoring was incomplete and inadequate\n    And pattern shows promises made to gain approval not kept in practice\n    And accountability creates pressure for genuine environmental stewardship\n",
