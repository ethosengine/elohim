  "content": "Scenario: Family boundaries protect Alex from ableist assumptions\n    Given family members might have internalized ableist beliefs\n    And some might make assumptions about Alex's quality of life or capabilities\n    When family interactions occur\n    Then the family_elohim should help Alex maintain boundaries\n    And it should support Alex in responding to ableist comments\n    And it should document patterns of disrespect or boundary violations\n    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves from family ableism\n    And the system should recognize that family can be source of harm\n    And Alex's right to distance from harmful family dynamics should be supported\n    And protection should be available even within family relationships\n",
