  "content": "Scenario: Sharing implementation wisdom with other community leaders\n    Given I have three years experience implementing protocol in Riverside\n    And other mayors considering adoption seek my advice\n    When I share honest assessment of benefits and challenges\n    Then I describe: what worked (community calibration, Constitutional Council)\n    And I acknowledge: what struggled (elderly accessibility, some controversy)\n    And I explain: factors predicting success (community buy-in, resources, patience)\n    And I provide: practical implementation guidance\n    And I offer: not utopia but better than what we had\n    And I emphasize: communities control adoption speed and approach\n    And peer network: enables learning across communities\n",
