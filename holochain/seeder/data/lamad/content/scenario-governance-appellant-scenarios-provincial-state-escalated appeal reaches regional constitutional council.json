  "content": "Scenario: Escalated appeal reaches Regional Constitutional Council\n    Given my appeal couldn't be resolved at community layer\n    And I escalated to peer agent review which affirmed the decision\n    When I request Constitutional Council review at regional level\n    Then randomly-selected citizens from across the region review my case\n    And They include Sarah Martinez, a nurse serving her 3-month term\n    And They deliberate for substantive time (2+ hours for complex cases)\n    And They have access to technical experts to explain complex aspects\n    And They create precedent that affects multiple communities in the region\n    And I receive judgment within one month of reaching this layer\n    And The decision includes detailed constitutional reasoning\n",
