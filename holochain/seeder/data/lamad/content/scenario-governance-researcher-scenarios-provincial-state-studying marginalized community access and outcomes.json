  "content": "Scenario: Studying marginalized community access and outcomes\n    Given I hypothesize protocol might help or harm marginalized communities\n    And I need to rigorously test distributional effects\n    When I analyze outcomes by race, class, disability, immigration status\n    Then I examine: whether marginalized communities adopt at equal rates\n    And I assess: whether they face barriers to effective participation\n    And I measure: whether Constitutional Council service includes them proportionally\n    And I analyze: whether appeal outcomes differ by demographic group\n    And I investigate: whether protocol reduces or exacerbates inequality\n    And I provide: evidence about who benefits and who suffers from protocol\n    And My research serves: justice by making invisible inequities visible\n",
