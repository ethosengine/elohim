  "content": "Feature: Community Care Economy Participation During Temporary Vulnerability\n  As a person experiencing temporary vulnerability\n  I want to participate in community care economy as both recipient and contributor\n  So that I receive dignified support while maintaining agency and building toward stability\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am navigating temporary vulnerability\n    And I am participating in the community care economy\n    And I am using the community_elohim to coordinate care relationships\n    And my care contributions are tracked with care tokens\n\n  Scenario: Receiving community support framed as reciprocal care, not charity\n    Given I need substantial support with resources, childcare, and crisis navigation\n    And I worry about being seen as \"taker\" or burden\n    When I access community support through care economy network\n    Then the Value Scanner frames support as reciprocal care, not charity\n    And recognizes my parenting labor as valuable care contribution\n    And validates that everyone needs support during vulnerability\n    And connects me to support based on my care economy participation\n    And ensures support is offered with dignity and respect\n    And my personal_agent helps me access help without shame\n    And tracks my ongoing care contributions even during crisis\n    And validates that receiving support when needed is how care economy works\n\n  Scenario: Contributing to community care economy even while in crisis\n    Given I am receiving support and have limited capacity\n    And I still have skills, knowledge, and care to offer\n    When opportunities arise to contribute to community\n    Then the Value Scanner surfaces contribution opportunities matching my capacity\n    And recognizes even small contributions as valuable\n    And facilitates contributions that don't overwhelm my limited resources\n    And tracks my care economy participation comprehensively\n    And validates that I am contributor as well as recipient\n    And my personal_agent suggests contributions I can manage\n    And ensures my contributions are recognized with care tokens\n    And supports reciprocity without exploiting vulnerable people\n\n  Scenario: Connecting with peer support from others experiencing similar vulnerability\n    Given I need connection with people who understand domestic violence, housing crisis, or similar challenges\n    And peer support reduces isolation and provides practical wisdom\n    When I seek peer support through community network\n    Then the community_elohim connects me to peer support groups\n    And identifies others with shared experiences willing to connect\n    And facilitates mutual support relationships\n    And validates that peer support is different from professional services\n    And protects privacy while enabling genuine connection\n    And my personal_agent helps me participate in peer community\n    And recognizes peer support relationships as care economy contribution\n    And celebrates mutual understanding and solidarity\n\n  Scenario: Participating in community mutual aid networks\n    Given community has mutual aid networks for resources, skills, childcare, support\n    And mutual aid operates on reciprocity and solidarity\n    When I engage with community mutual aid\n    Then the Value Scanner connects me to local mutual aid networks\n    And facilitates both my receiving and my contributing\n    And tracks mutual aid participation with care tokens\n    And helps me navigate mutual aid culture and expectations\n    And validates that mutual aid is community care, not individual charity\n    And my personal_agent coordinates my mutual aid relationships\n    And recognizes mutual aid as alternative to degrading institutional charity\n    And supports genuine reciprocity and collective care\n\n  Scenario: Building community care relationships that will endure beyond crisis\n    Given I am building relationships during crisis period\n    And some relationships could become long-term community connections\n    When I invest in community relationships\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me identify relationships with potential for depth\n    And supports genuine connection beyond transactional support\n    And facilitates relationship development over time\n    And tracks meaningful community relationships\n    And validates that vulnerable people build valuable friendships\n    And my personal_agent nurtures relationships that provide belonging\n    And recognizes community-building as important social infrastructure\n    And celebrates friendships that survive crisis transition\n\n  Scenario: Accessing community resources without invasive means-testing\n    Given traditional social services require proving I'm \"needy enough\"\n    And care economy provides support based on different principles\n    When I access community resources through care economy\n    Then the Value Scanner provides access based on care participation, not means-testing\n    And doesn't require exposing private trauma to gatekeepers\n    And validates my care contributions as basis for receiving support\n    And preserves my privacy and dignity\n    And connects me to resources efficiently without bureaucratic barriers\n    And my personal_agent helps me navigate with minimal burden\n    And recognizes that care economy support differs from institutional charity\n    And provides dignified alternative to degrading social services\n\n  Scenario: Participating in community decision-making about care economy governance\n    Given community care economy has governance decisions to make\n    And I am community member with stake in how care economy operates\n    When community discusses care economy policies or practices\n    Then the community_elohim enables my participation in governance\n    And validates my voice as community member regardless of crisis status\n    And helps me contribute to governance discussions within my capacity\n    And ensures vulnerable people's perspectives shape care economy\n    And my personal_agent surfaces governance opportunities\n    And recognizes governance participation as valuable civic contribution\n    And supports inclusive community decision-making\n    And celebrates community ownership of care economy\n\n  Scenario: Offering specialized knowledge or skills to community despite crisis circumstances\n    Given I have professional skills, knowledge, or experience that could help others\n    And crisis circumstances don't erase my capabilities\n    When community members could benefit from my expertise\n    Then the Value Scanner surfaces opportunities to share my knowledge\n    And facilitates skill-sharing and mentorship relationships\n    And recognizes my expertise contributions with care tokens\n    And validates that crisis doesn't eliminate my competence\n    And helps me contribute in ways that match my current capacity\n    And my personal_agent identifies good matches for my skills\n    And tracks my knowledge contributions to community\n    And celebrates that I am valuable community resource\n\n  Scenario: Receiving community support during acute crisis escalation\n    Given I am experiencing crisis escalation (domestic violence, housing loss, severe resource depletion)\n    And I need rapid community response\n    When acute crisis requires immediate support\n    Then the community_elohim coordinates rapid community response\n    And connects me to community members who can provide immediate help\n    And organizes material support, emergency housing, safety assistance\n    And provides crisis support with dignity and urgency\n    And validates that crisis escalation requires collective response\n    And my personal_agent alerts community to my urgent needs appropriately\n    And recognizes that care economy enables rapid crisis response\n    And ensures community mobilizes to support member in danger\n\n  Scenario: Contributing my lived experience to community knowledge and advocacy\n    Given my experience navigating domestic violence, housing crisis, or social services provides valuable insight\n    And community advocacy could benefit from my perspective\n    When opportunities arise to contribute to advocacy or community knowledge\n    Then the Value Scanner facilitates my participation in advocacy\n    And values my experiential knowledge as expertise\n    And helps me contribute to policy advocacy or community education\n    And protects my privacy while amplifying my voice\n    And recognizes advocacy participation as valuable community contribution\n    And my personal_agent identifies advocacy opportunities matching my capacity\n    And tracks my advocacy contributions with care economy credit\n    And celebrates that vulnerable people's knowledge shapes community\n\n  Scenario: Navigating community relationships with people at different vulnerability levels\n    Given community includes people in various circumstances (crisis, stability, privilege)\n    And relationships cross different resource and vulnerability levels\n    When I interact with community members from different positions\n    Then the community_elohim facilitates cross-difference relationships\n    And validates that I am peer regardless of current circumstances\n    And helps me navigate power dynamics in community relationships\n    And prevents exploitation while enabling genuine connection\n    And recognizes that care economy includes people in various situations\n    And my personal_agent supports me in authentic relationships across difference\n    And tracks care economy participation beyond simplistic \"giver/receiver\" binary\n    And celebrates diverse community including vulnerable and privileged members\n\n  Scenario: Building community care economy capital that will serve me beyond crisis\n    Given my care contributions during crisis are tracked and recognized\n    And care economy capital could support me after crisis resolves\n    When I accumulate care tokens through ongoing care contributions\n    Then the Value Scanner tracks my comprehensive care economy participation\n    And recognizes parenting, peer support, mutual aid, knowledge sharing, and other contributions\n    And builds care economy standing that will endure beyond temporary vulnerability\n    And validates that my crisis period contributions are valuable\n    And creates basis for future community support if needed\n    And my personal_agent helps me understand my care economy capital\n    And documents that vulnerability doesn't erase contribution\n    And ensures my care work is recognized long-term\n\n  Scenario: Transitioning from primarily receiving to balanced care economy participation\n    Given I am moving from acute crisis toward greater stability\n    And my capacity to contribute is increasing\n    When I rebuild capability to contribute more to community\n    Then the Value Scanner supports my transition to greater contribution\n    And celebrates increasing capacity without pressuring premature independence\n    And helps me find meaningful ways to contribute as I'm able\n    And validates that recovery enables greater community participation\n    And tracks my evolving care economy participation over time\n    And my personal_agent identifies contribution opportunities matching increasing capacity\n    And
