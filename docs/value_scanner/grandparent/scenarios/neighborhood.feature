Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent
  As a retired grandparent with time and presence in the neighborhood
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want my contributions to neighborhood care economy to be visible
  So that neighborhood resilience is strengthened by elder engagement

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the grandparent user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret lives in a residential neighborhood
    And Margaret is retired and has daytime presence in neighborhood
    And Margaret often cares for grandchildren in neighborhood context
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy

  Scenario: Retired grandparent presence strengthens neighborhood resilience
    Given Margaret is home during weekdays when many neighbors work
    And her presence provides neighborhood stability and observation
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks resident engagement
    Then it should recognize Margaret's daytime presence as valuable
    And it should value retired residents' neighborhood stewardship
    And it should recognize she provides informal neighborhood watch
    And her availability strengthens neighborhood safety and connection
    And retired elders should be seen as neighborhood assets
    And presence and engagement should accumulate care tokens
    And neighborhood benefits from Margaret's availability

  Scenario: Coordinating informal grandchild care sharing with neighbors
    Given Margaret cares for her grandchildren regularly
    And other neighborhood grandparents also provide childcare
    When Margaret coordinates with other grandparents
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate care coordination
    And it should help grandparents share resources and support
    And it should enable mutual aid among neighborhood grandparents
    And grandparents should form care networks for collective benefit
    And neighborhood care economy should strengthen through elder collaboration
    And Margaret should connect with other grandparents in similar roles

  Scenario: Neighborhood knowledge and connection from long residence
    Given Margaret has lived in neighborhood for many years
    And she knows neighborhood history, patterns, and relationships
    When the neighborhood_elohim recognizes resident knowledge
    Then it should value Margaret's accumulated neighborhood wisdom
    And it should recognize long-term residents as knowledge keepers
    And her connections should be seen as neighborhood social capital
    And institutional memory should be valued and utilized
    And Margaret's knowledge should inform neighborhood decisions

  Scenario: Creating intergenerational connections in neighborhood

    Then it should recognize Margaret's role in intergenerational connection
    And it should value her relationships with children, parents, and elders
    And she should help create all-ages neighborhood culture
    And intergenerational mixing should strengthen neighborhood resilience
    And Margaret's social bridging should be recognized as care work
    And neighborhood should benefit from cross-generational relationships

  Scenario: Informal neighborhood care and mutual aid provision
    Given Margaret helps neighbors with various small needs
    And she receives help from neighbors when needed
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks mutual aid

    And small acts of care should accumulate as care tokens
    And neighborhood care economy should be visible and valued
    And mutual aid should strengthen neighborhood bonds
    And Margaret should build neighborhood care relationships

  Scenario: Safety and well-being observation for neighborhood children
    Given Margaret is often outside with grandchildren
    And she observes neighborhood children's activities and safety

    And her presence should contribute to collective childcare
    And neighborhood children should benefit from elder attention
    And Margaret's observation should be recognized as care work
    And neighborhood should be safer because of engaged elders

  Scenario: Neighborhood walking and outdoor activity with grandchildren
    Given Margaret takes grandchildren on neighborhood walks
    And they visit parks, library, neighbors, and local businesses
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks local engagement
    Then it should recognize this as neighborhood participation
    And it should value intergenerational use of neighborhood spaces
    And it should show Margaret teaching grandchildren about their community
    And walking should build neighborhood social connections
    And local business patronage should support neighborhood economy
    And Margaret's activities should strengthen neighborhood vitality

  Scenario: Sharing traditional skills and knowledge with neighbors
    Given Margaret has skills from her generation (cooking, gardening, crafts)
    And neighbors might benefit from this knowledge
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks knowledge sharing

    And neighborhood care networks should support aging in place
    And Margaret's care work should enable her own aging in community
    And neighborhood relationships should provide long-term security

  Scenario: Seasonal and weather-related neighborhood mutual aid
    Given Margaret is often available during daytime
    And neighborhood needs vary with seasons and weather
    When the neighborhood coordinates seasonal care
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate seasonal mutual aid
    And Margaret might help with snow observation, mail collection, or storm preparation
    And she should receive help with physical tasks she cannot do
    And seasonal care should be reciprocal and community-building
    And neighborhood resilience should increase through elder participation
    And Margaret should contribute according to her capacity

  Scenario: Neighborhood representation and voice for retirees
    Given Margaret has time to attend neighborhood meetings
