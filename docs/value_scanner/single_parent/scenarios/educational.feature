Feature: Educational Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent
  As a single parent interfacing with educational systems
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want schools to recognize and accommodate single-parent family realities
  So that my children receive full educational support despite our family structure

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the single parent user "Maria" is registered in the system
    And Maria's three children attend different schools/grades (ages 6, 9, and 14)
    And Maria manages all school engagement alone with no co-parent support
    And she works full-time with limited flexibility
    And the educational governance context is active
    And the educational_elohim coordinates school-family interactions
    And Maria interfaces with elementary, middle, and early high school systems

  Scenario: Schools recognize single-parent families in forms and communications
    Given school forms typically ask for "mother and father" information
    And communications assume two-parent household availability
    When schools collect family information
    Then the educational_elohim should advocate for single-parent-inclusive forms
    And forms should acknowledge diverse family structures respectfully
    And communications should not assume two parents are available
    And schools should recognize single parents manage everything alone
    And Maria should not have to repeatedly explain or defend her family structure

  Scenario: Parent-teacher conferences scheduled for working single parent availability
    Given Maria must attend conferences for three children across different schools
    And she has no co-parent to split attendance or attend in her place
    When schools schedule parent-teacher conferences
    Then the educational_elohim should coordinate scheduling across multiple schools
    And schools should offer evening or flexible timing for working single parents
    And Maria should not have to take multiple work days for conferences
    And scheduling should recognize single parents cannot "send the other parent"
    And educational engagement should be accessible to working solo parents

  Scenario: School events and volunteer expectations account for single parent constraints
    Given schools often expect parent participation in events and volunteering
    And Maria has severe time and energy constraints as solo working parent
    When schools set participation expectations
    Then the educational_elohim should make visible single parents' realistic capacity
    And schools should not penalize children whose single parents cannot volunteer extensively
    And limited participation should not reflect on children's family or parent's commitment
    And schools should recognize some parents are managing heroically just to survive
    And Maria's children should not suffer because she cannot match two-parent family participation

  Scenario: Emergency contact procedures recognize single parents have no immediate backup
    Given Maria is the only parent available for children's emergencies
    And she may be unreachable due to work constraints
    When schools need emergency parent contact
    Then the educational_elohim should help Maria establish backup emergency contacts
    And schools should understand single parents may not be immediately available
    And emergency protocols should include extended family or neighbor backups
    And schools should work with Maria's realistic availability constraints
    And children's emergency needs should be met even when solo parent is unavailable

  Scenario: Homework support expectations realistic for single parent households
    Given Maria manages homework support for three children across different grade levels
    And she does this after full workday while managing dinner, household, and bedtime
    When schools assign homework requiring parent support
    Then the educational_elohim should advocate for realistic homework expectations
    And assignments should not assume extensive parent availability or expertise
    And schools should recognize single parents have limited capacity to support homework
    And children should not be penalized for single parent's time constraints
    And homework policies should account for diverse family circumstances

  Scenario: School fee and activity cost assistance for single-income families
    Given Maria's single income must support household of four
    And she struggles to afford school fees, field trips, sports, and activities
    When schools require fees or activity payments
    Then the educational_elohim should connect Maria to fee assistance programs
    And schools should provide cost support without stigmatizing single-parent families
    And all children should access educational opportunities regardless of single-parent economics
    And fee assistance should be available and accessible
    And Maria's children should participate fully without financial exclusion

  Scenario: Before and after school care affordable and accessible for working single parents
    Given Maria works 8-5 while school runs roughly 8-3
    And she cannot afford $400+/month per child for extended care across three children
    When Maria needs childcare for school schedule gaps
    Then the educational_elohim should help her access affordable before/after school care
    And schools should provide cost-effective extended care options
    And subsidies should be available for single-income families
    And care should cover the full gap between school and work hours
    And Maria should be able to maintain employment through affordable school-based care

  Scenario: Single parent representation in school governance and decision-making
    Given single parents have specific needs and perspectives
    And they are often underrepresented in school governance due to time constraints
    When schools form parent councils or governance bodies
    Then the educational_elohim should facilitate single parent participation
    And schools should make governance accessible to time-constrained parents
    And single parent voices should inform school policies
    And Maria should be able to contribute to school governance despite constraints
    And educational policy should reflect single-parent family realities

  Scenario: Teacher understanding of single-parent household stress on children
    Given children in single-parent families may experience unique stressors
    And teachers should understand these realities without stigmatizing
    When teachers work with Maria's children
    Then the educational_elohim should help educators understand single-parent contexts
    And teachers should recognize potential impacts on children without deficit framing
    And children should receive appropriate support without being labeled as "at-risk" due to family structure
    And schools should support thriving despite different family structures
    And Maria's children should be seen as individuals, not stereotyped by single-parent status

  Scenario: Communication methods accommodate working single parent schedule
    Given Maria cannot answer phone calls during work hours
    And she manages communications for three children across different schools
    When schools communicate with parents
    Then the educational_elohim should coordinate school communications efficiently
    And schools should use methods accessible to working parents (email, portal, evening calls)
    And Maria should not miss critical information due to daytime-only communication
    And communication should be consolidated and efficient for time-constrained parents
    And schools should respect that single working parents have limited availability

  Scenario: Special education or support service coordination across siblings
    Given one or more of Maria's children may need educational support services
    And she must coordinate any special needs alone across multiple children
    When children require special education services or support
    Then the educational_elohim should help Maria coordinate across children and schools
    And schools should recognize she's managing support needs without co-parent
    And scheduling of meetings and services should accommodate her work constraints
    And single parents should receive extra support for complex special education navigation
    And Maria should be able to advocate effectively for children's needs despite time limitations

  Scenario: Schools challenge single-parent deficit narratives through care economy data
    Given society often views single-parent families as inherently problematic
    And this stigma affects how teachers and administrators view Maria's children
    When schools engage with single-parent families
    Then the educational_elohim should provide care economy data showing single parents' contributions
    And schools should recognize single parents as providing extraordinary care
    And deficit narratives about single-parent families should be challenged with evidence
    And Maria and her children should be treated with respect, not pity
    And educational systems should support single-parent family thriving, not assume deficiency

  Scenario: Parent involvement recognition values Maria's solo engagement
    Given Maria manages all school engagement for three children alone
    And partnered parents split involvement between two people
    When schools recognize parent involvement
    Then the educational_elohim should quantify Maria's engagement across all three children
    And her solo involvement should be recognized as extraordinary effort
    And schools should value her participation even if she cannot match two-parent family availability
    And parent involvement metrics should account for family structure differences
    And Maria should receive appropriate recognition for managing everything alone
