Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult
  As a young adult (ages 18-25) in early independence
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want to build adult life skills and manage resources effectively
  So that I develop sustainable practices and personal agency

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the young_adult user "Aisha" is registered in the system
    And Aisha is 23 years old
    And Aisha lives independently in her first solo apartment
    And Aisha earns $38,000 annual salary
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Aisha's personal_agent is configured for capability development
    And full adult privacy controls are enabled

  Scenario: First-time budget planning for independent living
    Given Aisha has a monthly grocery budget of $200
    And she is learning to manage finances independently
    When Aisha opens the Value Scanner budget planning feature
    Then the personal_agent should display her monthly allocation
    And the system should show remaining budget in real-time
    And the interface should provide clear spending analytics
    And budget recommendations should account for her income level
    And the agent should help her balance immediate needs with future goals
    And financial education should be integrated into the experience

  Scenario: Learning meal planning without formal training
    Given Aisha has minimal cooking experience
    And she wants to eat nutritiously on a tight budget
    When Aisha requests meal planning assistance
    Then the personal_agent should suggest recipes based on her skill level
    And recommendations should optimize nutrition per dollar
    And the system should consider ingredients she already has
    And the agent should teach cooking skills progressively
    And meal plans should fit her time constraints
    And the interface should feel like a patient teacher, not a critic

  Scenario: Personal agent helps prevent expensive mistakes
    Given Aisha bought too much fresh produce last week
    And the produce spoiled before she could use it
    When the personal_agent analyzes her shopping patterns
    Then it should identify the waste pattern
    And it should suggest buying smaller quantities
    And it should recommend frozen alternatives when appropriate
    And the feedback should be constructive, not judgmental
    And Aisha should learn from the mistake without shame
    And the system should help her optimize future purchases

  Scenario: Building nutrition awareness while managing costs
    Given Aisha has been working through lunch frequently
    And her energy levels are declining
    When the personal_agent reviews her eating patterns
    Then it should flag the concerning pattern
    And it should say "You've worked through lunch four days this week"
    And it should suggest quick, nutritious options within budget
    And the agent should help her see self-care as essential, not optional
    And recommendations should balance nutrition, cost, and time constraints

  Scenario: Developing sustainable shopping habits independently
    Given Aisha is establishing her adult shopping patterns
    And she wants to reduce food waste
    When Aisha scans items at the store
    Then the personal_agent should track purchase patterns
    And it should identify what she consistently uses versus what spoils
    And it should suggest sustainable alternatives
    And the system should help her build efficient shopping habits
    And waste reduction analytics should inform future decisions
    And Aisha should develop adult competence through practice

  Scenario: Managing competing demands on personal resources
    Given Aisha has limited time and energy
    And she must balance work, self-care, and family obligations
    When Aisha plans her week in the Value Scanner
    Then the personal_agent should help her allocate care capacity
    And it should flag when she's over-committed
    And it should recognize self-care as legitimate care work
    And recommendations should support sustainable work-life balance
    And the system should help her set healthy boundaries

  Scenario: Privacy controls for adult financial independence
    Given Aisha has full adult autonomy
    And she wants to keep financial details private
    When Aisha configures her privacy settings
    Then she should have complete control over data sharing
    And her financial information should remain private by default
    And she should explicitly consent to any family visibility
    And workplace should have no access to personal data
    And privacy controls should be granular and transparent
    And the system should respect her adult independence

  Scenario: Tracking personal growth in life skills
    Given Aisha has been using the Value Scanner for three months
    And she's developing adult household management skills
    When Aisha reviews her progress
    Then the system should show skill development over time
    And it should highlight improvements in waste reduction
    And it should track nutritional balance improvements
    And it should show budget optimization progress
    And the feedback should build confidence and competence
    And Aisha should see evidence of her growing capability

  Scenario: Multi-store comparison for budget optimization
    Given Aisha's limited budget requires strategic shopping
    And different stores offer different value propositions
    When Aisha compares shopping options
    Then the personal_agent should analyze prices across stores
    And it should consider transportation costs in calculations
    And it should identify where spending more saves money long-term
    And recommendations should optimize total value, not just price
    And the system should help her find efficiency frontiers
    And decision support should build financial literacy

  Scenario: Recognition of self-care as care work
    Given Aisha tends to prioritize work over personal needs
    And burnout would undermine all her capabilities
    When the personal_agent monitors her well-being
    Then it should recognize self-care as legitimate care work
    And it should flag when self-care is being neglected
    And it should help her understand that caring for herself enables other contributions
    And the system should validate rest and nutrition as valuable
    And Aisha should learn that personal stewardship is foundational

  Scenario: Building adult financial literacy through practice
    Given Aisha received no practical finance education in school
    And she's learning by doing with real consequences
    When Aisha makes financial decisions in the scanner
    Then the personal_agent should provide contextual education
    And it should explain trade-offs in accessible language
    And it should help her understand opportunity costs
    And education should integrate seamlessly with decision-making
    And Aisha should build financial competence through supported practice
    And the system should prevent catastrophic mistakes while enabling learning

  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained for adult user
    Given Aisha has full autonomy over technology use
    And the constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Aisha chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then the disconnection must be honored immediately
    And all data retention must follow legal minimums only
    And no manipulative patterns should attempt to retain usage
    And Aisha's right to opt out must be absolute
    And the system must respect her sovereign choice
