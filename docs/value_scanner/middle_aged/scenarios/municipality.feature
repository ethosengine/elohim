Feature: Municipal Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult
  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system
  Operating at the municipal governance layer
  I want to influence municipal policy and infrastructure based on my care economy experience
  So that municipal systems better support families managing multigenerational care responsibilities

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the middle-aged user "Robert" is registered in the system
    And Robert is 52 years old with decades of care economy experience
    And the municipal governance context is active
    And municipal_elohim coordinates municipal care economy infrastructure
    And Robert pays property taxes and participates in municipal civic life

  Scenario: Municipal elder care policy informed by caregiver experience
    Given Robert coordinates care for parents ages 78 and 75
    And he's navigated municipal elder care systems
    And he understands what works and what's missing
    When municipal_elohim connects his experience to policy development
    Then it should channel his feedback to municipal elder care planning
    And surface his expertise to municipal aging services
    And help him advocate for caregiver support programs
    And connect him to municipal boards and advisory committees
    And ensure municipal policy reflects actual caregiver needs
    And recognize that users of systems should shape policy
    And build elder care infrastructure based on lived experience

  Scenario: Municipal work-family policy advocacy based on personal navigation
    Given Robert balances intense career demands with family care
    And he's learned that work-family balance requires systemic support
    And municipal policy can support or hinder work-family balance

    Then it should connect him to municipal work-family policy development
    And help him advocate for paid family leave, flexible work policies, and caregiver protections
    And surface opportunities to testify or serve on municipal commissions
