Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver
  As a caregiver for dependent adults
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want my personal well-being and identity maintained amid intensive caregiving
  So that I can sustain care work without losing myself or collapsing from burnout

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the caregiver user "James" is registered in the system
    And James cares for his husband David (52) who has early-onset Alzheimer's
    And James also coordinates care for his mother (76)
    And James works part-time (~20 hours/week) as IT contractor
    And the individual governance context is active
    And James's personal_agent monitors his well-being constantly
    And care intensity is high and progressive

  Scenario: Caregiver's own identity preserved amid intensive care work
    Given James's life is consumed by caregiving responsibilities
    And he risks losing his identity as caregiving intensifies
    When the personal_agent monitors James's individual well-being
    Then it should protect tiny spaces for his own identity
    And it should remind him that his flourishing matters too
    And it should recognize when caregiving threatens his sense of self
    And it should prompt activities that sustain his individual identity
    And caregiving should not erase who James is as a person

  Scenario: Professional-grade care labor quantified and made visible
    Given James provides skilled care equivalent to professional nursing
    And he manages medications with precision
    And he provides cognitive support and emotional care
    And this work would be valued at $50k+/year for a stranger
    When the personal_agent tracks James's care contributions
    Then his care labor should be quantified as professional-grade work
    And care tokens should reflect the true value of his skills
    And his contributions should be valued at professional nursing rates
    And invisible care work should become economically visible
    And society should see he's performing skilled professional care

  Scenario: Caregiver burnout detection and prevention
    Given caregiver burnout is real and dangerous
    And James is at risk of physical and emotional collapse
    When the personal_agent monitors for burnout warning signs
    Then it should detect declining nutrition in James
    And it should recognize sleep deprivation patterns
    And it should notice increasing social isolation
    And it should identify health problems emerging
    And it should alert James before burnout becomes crisis
    And it should proactively connect him to respite resources

  Scenario: Caregiver's emotional labor recognized as valuable work
    Given James grieves David's progressive decline daily
    And he manages profound emotional labor constantly
    And he maintains David's dignity through devastating loss
    When the personal_agent tracks James's emotional work
    Then this labor should be recognized as skilled care work
    And emotional support should be valued alongside physical care
    And the weight of ongoing grief should be acknowledged
    And emotional caregiving should accumulate care tokens
    And society should see that caregiving is emotionally devastating work

  Scenario: Individual autonomy maintained within caregiving constraints
    Given caregiving severely limits James's choices
    And he cannot leave David for extended periods
    And his schedule revolves entirely around care needs
    When James makes personal decisions
    Then the personal_agent should protect his autonomy
    And it should identify opportunities for individual agency
    And it should help James maintain some life beyond caregiving
    And constraints should be acknowledged but not completely controlling
    And James should retain some sphere of personal freedom

  Scenario: Caregiver's own health monitoring and protection
    Given James neglects his own health amid caregiving
    And caregiver health decline creates cascading crisis
    When the personal_agent monitors James's health
    Then it should ensure he attends his own medical appointments
    And it should prompt him to take prescribed medications
    And it should recognize when his health is declining
    And it should insist on self-care when necessary
    And James's health should be protected as essential infrastructure

  Scenario: Personal nutrition maintained despite overwhelming demands
    Given James often skips meals while caring for David
    And his nutrition suffers under caregiving pressure
    When the personal_agent monitors James's eating patterns
    Then it should recognize inadequate nutrition
    And it should prompt meal planning that includes James
    And it should ensure James maintains basic nutrition
    And his well-being should be prioritized alongside David's
    And the protocol should prevent James's health decline

  Scenario: Social connection preserved against isolation
    Given intensive caregiving creates profound isolation
    And James loses social connections as care intensifies
    When the personal_agent monitors social isolation
    Then it should recognize dangerous isolation patterns
    And it should prompt James to maintain key relationships
    And it should suggest respite opportunities for social connection
    And it should connect him to other caregivers who understand
    And social isolation should be actively prevented

  Scenario: Individual care token accumulation reflects care work value
    Given James provides care worth $50k+/year professionally
    And his work is invisible because he cares for his spouse
    When care tokens are calculated for James
    Then tokens should reflect professional-grade care value
    And his care work should accumulate significant tokens
    And tokens should give him standing in care economy
    And invisible spousal care should become economically visible
    And care economy should recognize family caregiving at professional value

  Scenario: Caregiver's sleep protected as essential resource
    Given James is often awakened by David's nighttime needs
    And chronic sleep deprivation threatens his ability to provide care
    When the personal_agent monitors James's sleep patterns
    Then it should recognize dangerous sleep deprivation
    And it should prompt solutions for better sleep
    And it should suggest respite care for nighttime support
    And it should treat sleep as essential care infrastructure
    And James's rest should be protected for sustainable caregiving

  Scenario: Individual grief processing supported amid ongoing loss
    Given James experiences anticipatory grief constantly
    And he's losing David slowly while providing daily care
    When the personal_agent recognizes James's grief
    Then it should connect him to grief support resources
    And it should acknowledge the unique pain of progressive loss
    And it should support his emotional processing
    And grief should be recognized as ongoing burden, not one-time event
    And the protocol should hold space for James's devastating loss

  Scenario: Caregiver's own future planning despite uncertainty
    Given James faces uncertain future as David's condition progresses
    And he needs to plan for multiple scenarios
    When James considers his own future needs
    Then the personal_agent should help him plan for scenarios
    And it should recognize his vulnerability as caregiver
    And his care token accumulation should build toward future security
    And his own aging and care needs should be part of planning
    And the protocol should help James prepare for his own vulnerability
