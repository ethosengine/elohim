Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Teen
  As a teen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to be recognized as a full participant in community care economy
  So that I access resources based on contribution and build relationships with community institutions

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teen user "Jasmine" is registered in the system
    And Jasmine is 16 years old
    And she lives in the Riverside community
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim coordinates community-wide care economy
    And Jasmine has accumulated care contributions across household, work, and volunteering

  Scenario: Teen recognized as full community participant, not future member
    Given Jasmine has substantial care contributions across multiple contexts
    And she volunteers 4 hours per week at community center
    When the community_elohim processes her participation
    Then she should be recognized as a current contributor, not a youth in training
    And her care work should be valued at the same care economy rate as adults
    And community resources should be accessible based on her demonstrated contribution
    And she should have standing in community care economy discussions
    And the system should reflect that she is already a productive member of society
    And her generation's contributions should be made visible at community scale

  Scenario: Teen accesses community resources based on care contributions
    Given Jasmine has accumulated significant care tokens
    And the community offers educational programs and skill-building workshops
    When Jasmine seeks to access community opportunities
    Then her care contributions should qualify her for access
    And she should not need parent mediation to access community resources
    And the community_elohim should recognize her as an independent participant
    And opportunities should be surfaced based on her interests and contribution patterns
    And she should experience that care economy operates on reciprocity
    And her care tokens should give her legitimate standing to access community resources

  Scenario: Community opportunities surfaced based on teen's care patterns
    Given Jasmine has demonstrated leadership through her care contributions
    And the community is recruiting for youth advisory board
    When the community_elohim analyzes needs and capabilities
    Then it should surface the opportunity to Jasmine
    And explain why she's a good match: "Your care contributions demonstrate the leadership they're seeking"
    And connect her care work to civic opportunities
    And help her see pathways from care contribution to community leadership
    And demonstrate that care economy participation opens doors
    And recognize her capabilities rather than just her potential

  Scenario: Teen volunteers recognized as substantial economic contribution
    Given Jasmine volunteers 4 hours per week at community center
    And this is 16 hours per month of skilled labor
    When her volunteer work is tracked by community_elohim
    Then it should be valued at appropriate care economy rates
    And if professional childcare costs $15/hour, her care work should be valued accordingly
    And her contribution of $240/month worth of care labor should be visible
    And community institutions should recognize their dependence on her labor
    And she should accumulate care tokens reflecting this substantial contribution
    And the invisibility of teen volunteer labor should be corrected

  Scenario: Teen builds professional relationships through community engagement
    Given Jasmine volunteers at community center under director Marcus
    And this relationship could support her future career
    When she demonstrates capability and reliability over time
    Then the community_elohim should track these professional relationship developments
    And surface when relationships could support her goals
    And help her understand that she's building professional networks
    And recognize that community engagement creates social capital
    And support her in developing adult professional relationships
    And demonstrate that care economy participation builds career pathways

  Scenario: Teen participates in community planning and decision-making
    Given the community is planning a new youth recreation facility
    And Jasmine has relevant knowledge as a current user of community spaces
    When the community_elohim facilitates community input
    Then Jasmine's voice should be actively solicited
    And her input should carry weight in planning decisions
    And her care contributions should give her standing in the conversation
    And community planners should engage her as a legitimate stakeholder
    And she should learn that civic participation is her right and responsibility
    And youth voice should shape systems designed for collective flourishing

  Scenario: Community supports teen's transition to adult independence
    Given Jasmine is preparing for college and adult life
    And she has accumulated care contributions and care tokens
    When she needs support for transition to adulthood
    Then the community_elohim should surface relevant resources
    And her care tokens should be convertible to educational resources
    And community institutions should support her based on demonstrated contribution
    And mentorship, skill-building, and educational opportunities should be accessible
    And the community should invest in her success as she invested in community wellbeing
    And care economy should support intergenerational care and lifecycle transitions

  Scenario: Teen coordinates care work across community contexts
    Given Jasmine works part-time, volunteers, and contributes to family
    And these contexts are all part of community care economy
    When the community_elohim aggregates her contributions
    Then all care work should be visible in integrated view
    And she should see how her contributions connect across contexts
    And understand that paid work, household labor, and volunteering are all care economy
    And develop sophisticated understanding of how care creates value in multiple forms
    And learn to manage complexity while maintaining coherent identity
    And see herself as participating in integrated community care economy

  Scenario: Community care economy prevents teen labor exploitation
    Given Jasmine works part-time in retail
    And young workers are vulnerable to exploitation
    When her workplace conditions are monitored through community care economy
    Then the community_elohim should track whether her labor is fairly compensated
    And flag if work hours interfere with education or development
    And recognize if workplace conditions become exploitative
    And surface resources about worker rights and fair labor practices
    And provide community support if she faces workplace problems
    And demonstrate that care economy extends to protecting young workers

  Scenario: Teen's civic engagement recognized as care contribution
    Given Jasmine participates in community service projects
    And she attends city council meetings about youth issues
    When her civic engagement is tracked
    Then it should be recognized as care work for the community
    And political participation should be valued in care economy
    And she should learn that civic engagement is care labor
    And her generation should understand that democracy requires active care work
    And community_elohim should make visible that youth civic participation matters
    And her care tokens should reflect her contribution to democratic governance

  Scenario: Community provides safety net when teen faces crisis
    Given Jasmine encounters a family crisis or household instability
    And she has been a consistent community contributor
    When the crisis occurs and she needs support
    Then the community_elohim should surface available resources
    And her care contributions should give her standing to access support
    And community institutions should respond to protect her wellbeing
    And the system should preserve her autonomy and dignity
    And demonstrate that care economy operates as mutual aid
    And show that communities care for members who have cared for community

  Scenario: Teen contributes to community knowledge and improvement
    Given Jasmine has insights about what works and doesn't work for teens
    And she uses community services and programs
    When the community seeks feedback about youth programs
    Then her input should be actively sought and valued
    And she should have voice in shaping community services
    And the community_elohim should facilitate youth feedback to reach decision-makers
    And her experience using systems should inform system improvement
    And communities should recognize that users have valuable knowledge about how systems function
    And teen voice should shape care economy design and implementation
