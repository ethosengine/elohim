Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Teen
  As a teen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want to understand how my consumption choices affect ecological systems
  So that I participate in bioregional care economy and extend stewardship to land, water, and future generations

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teen user "Jasmine" is registered in the system
    And Jasmine is 16 years old
    And she lives in the Riverside bioregion
    And the ecological governance context is active
    And bioregional_elohim tracks environmental and ecosystem impacts
    And Jasmine's personal_agent integrates ecological awareness

  Scenario: Teen develops sophisticated understanding of consumption impacts
    Given Jasmine makes daily purchasing decisions
    And each choice has ecological consequences
    When she uses the Value Scanner to evaluate options
    Then her personal_agent should surface ecological information
    And explain water usage, carbon footprint, and ecosystem impacts
    And connect choices to bioregional effects: "This produce is local and seasonal"
    And help her understand that consumption is participation in ecological systems
    And build sophisticated ecological literacy through daily practice
    And develop her capability to make environmentally informed decisions

  Scenario: Local and seasonal food choices recognized as bioregional care
    Given Jasmine is shopping for fresh produce
    And she has option between local strawberries and imported berries
    When bioregional_elohim provides decision support
    Then it should highlight local, seasonal options
    And explain bioregional benefits: "Local strawberries support regional farmers and reduce transport emissions"
    And help her understand food system connections to ecosystem health
    And recognize her choice of local food as care for bioregion
    And track bioregional care contributions alongside other care work
    And demonstrate that environmental stewardship is care economy participation

  Scenario: Teen learns bioregional water and energy systems
    Given Jasmine lives in a watershed with specific water dynamics
    And her consumption affects water and energy resources
    When her personal_agent explains resource connections
    Then it should teach her about local water sources and constraints
    And show how her choices affect regional water availability
    And explain energy systems powering her community
    And connect individual consumption to collective resource management
    And build understanding of herself as participant in bioregional systems
    And develop ecological citizenship grounded in local ecosystems

  Scenario: Sustainable consumption choices tracked as environmental care work
    Given Jasmine preferentially chooses sustainable products
    And she has bought local/seasonal/sustainable products in 12 of 15 purchases
    When bioregional_elohim analyzes her consumption patterns
    Then it should recognize her environmental care contributions
    And track her choices as care work for ecosystem health
    And calculate environmental impact reduction from her choices
    And value bioregional stewardship in care token allocation
    And demonstrate that ecological care creates economic value
    And recognize environmental activism as legitimate care labor

  Scenario: Teen climate activism recognized as care for future generations
    Given Jasmine participates in climate action organizing
    And she attends climate strikes and advocates for environmental policy
    When bioregional_elohim tracks her environmental engagement
    Then it should recognize climate activism as care work
    And value her labor for intergenerational justice
    And understand that fighting for climate action is care for future
    And track civic environmental engagement alongside other care contributions
    And demonstrate that ecological advocacy is essential care economy work
    And support her generation's environmental leadership

  Scenario: Bioregional food systems supported by teen participation
    Given Jasmine's bioregion has local farms and food producers
    And supporting local agriculture strengthens bioregional resilience
    When she chooses local food through the Value Scanner
    Then bioregional_elohim should track support for local food systems
    And recognize that her purchases sustain regional agriculture
    And show how local food choices support bioregional economy
    And connect her consumption to farmer livelihoods and land stewardship
    And help her understand food system as part of bioregional care economy
    And demonstrate that her choices affect ecosystem and economy together

  Scenario: Teen learns to value ecosystem services
    Given Jasmine benefits from clean water, air, and functional ecosystems
    And ecosystem services are typically invisible in market economy
    When bioregional_elohim explains ecosystem dependencies
    Then it should teach her about ecosystem services she depends on
    And show how wetlands filter water, forests stabilize climate, and pollinators enable food production
    And help her understand that ecosystems provide care that sustains human life
    And recognize that ecosystem health is prerequisite for all other care
    And value ecological stewardship as foundational care work
    And build understanding that economy depends on ecology, not the other way around

  Scenario: Waste reduction and circular economy practices tracked
    Given Jasmine practices waste reduction and composting
    And she chooses products with minimal packaging
    When bioregional_elohim tracks her waste and resource patterns
    Then it should recognize waste reduction as bioregional care work
    And calculate diversion from landfill and resource conservation
    And value her participation in circular economy practices
    And connect individual waste choices to bioregional resource flows
    And demonstrate that waste reduction is care for ecosystem health
    And support transition from linear to circular economic thinking

  Scenario: Teen participates in bioregional ecological restoration
    Given Jasmine volunteers for watershed cleanup events
    And she plants native species in community restoration projects
    When bioregional_elohim tracks her ecological care labor
    Then it should recognize restoration work as care for land and ecosystem
    And value her labor for ecosystem health at care economy rates
    And calculate ecological benefits from restoration participation
    And acknowledge that she's doing work professional ecologists would be paid for
    And demonstrate that ecological labor deserves recognition and compensation
    And support her understanding that ecosystem repair is collective responsibility

  Scenario: Bioregional knowledge transmitted across generations
    Given Jasmine learns from elders about local ecology and seasonal patterns
    And indigenous and long-term residents hold bioregional knowledge
    When she engages with bioregional wisdom holders
    Then bioregional_elohim should recognize knowledge transmission
    And value elder teaching as care work for ecological literacy
    And support intergenerational ecological knowledge sharing
    And help her understand that bioregional care includes cultural practices
    And connect her to deep knowledge about living in her specific place
    And demonstrate that care economy includes indigenous wisdom and ecological tradition

  Scenario: Teen's generation prepares for climate adaptation
    Given Jasmine's generation will face climate change impacts
    And bioregional resilience requires preparation and adaptation
    When bioregional_elohim engages climate preparation
    Then it should help her understand local climate vulnerabilities
    And support her developing adaptive capabilities
    And recognize her climate preparation as care for future self and community
    And connect her to bioregional climate adaptation networks
    And value her generation's work to build climate resilience
    And support realistic engagement with ecological challenges her generation inherits

  Scenario: Bioregional care economy integrates human and ecosystem flourishing
    Given Jasmine participates in care economy across multiple contexts
