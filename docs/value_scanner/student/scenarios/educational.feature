Feature: Educational Layer Value Recognition for Student
  As a student whose primary work is learning and development
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want my learning recognized as valuable work and care economy participation
  So that education is understood as mutual care investment rather than mere credential acquisition

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the student user "Kenji" is registered in the system
    And Kenji is studying environmental science full-time
    And Kenji's primary "work" is learning and development
    And Kenji also teaches peers informally and contributes to learning community
    And the educational governance context is active
    And the educational_elohim could coordinate learning relationships
    And education requires substantial unpaid labor from students

  Scenario: Learning recognized as valuable work, not just credential pursuit
    Given Kenji spends 40+ hours per week on academic work
    And traditional economics treats student labor as non-productive
    When the educational_elohim tracks Kenji's educational work
    Then it should recognize studying as labor that creates value
    And it should accumulate care tokens for learning work
    And it should validate "You invested 45 hours in learning this week"
    And student intellectual labor should be valued, not invisible
    And the system should recognize education as work toward capability development
    And learning should be understood as care economy investment

  Scenario: Student contribution to peer learning community
    Given Kenji helps classmates understand difficult concepts
    And peer teaching strengthens everyone's learning
    When the educational_elohim tracks peer teaching
    Then it should recognize Kenji's teaching labor as care contribution
    And it should accumulate care tokens for tutoring peers
    And it should value "Kenji explained organic chemistry to 3 struggling classmates"
    And peer education should be recognized as community care work
    And the system should make student teaching labor visible
    And intellectual generosity should be valued and encouraged

  Scenario: Connecting academic learning to care economy values
    Given Kenji studies environmental science
    And his field directly relates to planetary care economy
    When the educational_elohim connects learning to care principles
    Then it should help Kenji see environmental science as care work
    And it should link his academic study to ecological stewardship
    And it should show how his education prepares him for care contributions
    And learning should be framed as developing capacity to serve flourishing
    And the system should integrate academic work with care economy purpose
    And Kenji should understand his education as care economy investment

  Scenario: Recognizing educational institution care economy failures
    Given Kenji's college charges high tuition while many students face food insecurity
    And educational institutions can exploit student labor
    When the educational_elohim helps Kenji analyze institutional practices
    Then it should teach him to recognize extractive vs. care-based institutions
    And it should help him see when colleges fail care economy principles
    And it should validate his critique of exploitative educational models
    And the system should build critical awareness of institutional care failures
    And Kenji should learn to evaluate institutions through care economy lens
    And educational institutions should be accountable to care economy standards

  Scenario: Study group coordination as care economy practice
    Given Kenji participates in study groups with peers
    And study groups require coordination, hosting, and emotional labor
    When the educational_elohim tracks study group participation
    Then it should recognize hosting study group as care contribution
    And it should value coordinating schedules and managing group dynamics
    And it should accumulate care tokens for creating learning spaces
    And study group labor should be visible and valued
    And the system should recognize collective learning as care economy
    And academic collaboration should be understood as mutual care

  Scenario: Balancing learning work with survival work
    Given Kenji must work 15 hours/week to afford basic expenses
    And work hours compete with study time
    When the educational_elohim helps Kenji balance competing demands
    Then it should recognize the impossible tension between learning and survival
    And it should help him optimize limited time across demands
    And it should validate that he cannot do everything perfectly
    And it should advocate for better institutional support for working students
    And the system should recognize structural unfairness in student economics
    And Kenji should not be blamed for constraints created by inadequate support

  Scenario: Student labor contributions to educational institutions
    Given Kenji might do research work, TA work, or other academic labor
    And universities benefit from student labor beyond tuition
    When the educational_elohim tracks student labor
    Then it should recognize unpaid or underpaid student work for institution
    And it should help Kenji understand fair compensation for academic labor
    And it should accumulate care tokens for labor that benefits university
    And student labor should be recognized and fairly compensated
    And the system should help students identify labor exploitation
    And educational institutions should not extract uncompensated labor

  Scenario: Learning disabilities and accommodations as care economy
    Given some students need educational accommodations
    And accommodations require advocacy and coordination
    When students access disability services
    Then the educational_elohim should support accommodation advocacy
    And it should recognize student labor of managing accommodations
    And it should value disability services as institutional care work
    And accommodation should be understood as educational care economy
    And the system should support equitable access to education
    And disability justice should be core to educational care economy

  Scenario: Connecting classroom learning to lived experience
    Given Kenji learns economic theory in classes
    And he lives care economy reality daily in his household
    When the educational_elohim bridges theory and practice
    Then it should help Kenji see connections between academic concepts and daily life
    And it should validate his experiential knowledge as real learning
    And it should show how his household management applies economic principles
    And lived experience should be recognized as legitimate knowledge source
    And the system should integrate academic and experiential learning
    And Kenji's practical care economy work should inform his academic understanding

  Scenario: Student mental health support as educational care infrastructure
    Given academic pressure threatens student mental health
    And learning requires emotional and psychological well-being
    When educational institutions provide mental health support
    Then the educational_elohim should recognize counseling as educational care
    And it should value mental health services as essential to learning
    And it should accumulate care tokens for peer emotional support
    And mental health work should be understood as educational infrastructure
    And the system should recognize that learning requires whole-person care
    And educational care economy includes psychological and emotional support

  Scenario: Alternative education models aligned with care economy
    Given traditional higher education often fails care economy principles
    And alternative models exist (cooperative education, free universities, community learning)
    When Kenji explores educational alternatives
    Then the educational_elohim should inform him of care-aligned options
    And it should help him evaluate educational models against care principles
    And it should recognize diverse pathways for learning and development
    And the system should support student exploration of alternative education
    And education should serve flourishing, not just credential accumulation
    And care economy education should be accessible and diverse

  Scenario: Lifelong learning beyond formal education
    Given Kenji's learning will continue after graduation
    And education is lifelong process, not just college phase
    When the educational_elohim supports ongoing learning
    Then it should help Kenji develop self-directed learning capabilities
    And it should recognize informal learning as valuable as formal coursework
    And it should encourage learning from community, work, and life experience
    And lifelong learning should be valued as care economy participation
    And the system should support learning as continuous development
    And education should be understood as lifelong care economy investment

  Scenario: Student voice in educational governance and policy
    Given students are primary stakeholders in education
    And educational policies directly affect student well-being
    When students participate in educational governance
    Then the educational_elohim should recognize advocacy as care contribution
    And it should value student organizing for better policies
    And it should accumulate care tokens for participating in governance
    And student voice should be central to educational decision-making
    And the system should amplify student participation in education policy
    And students should govern their educational institutions democratically
