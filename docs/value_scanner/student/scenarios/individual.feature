Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Student
  As a student learning to manage adult independence on limited resources
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want to develop care economy skills and build sustainable adult patterns
  So that I can thrive now and carry these capabilities throughout adult life

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the student user "Kenji" is registered in the system
    And Kenji is 20 years old
    And Kenji is a college sophomore studying environmental science
    And Kenji works part-time 15 hours per week
    And Kenji has a total budget of $180/week for all expenses
    And Kenji allocates $50/week for personal groceries
    And Kenji lives in shared apartment with three roommates
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Kenji's personal_agent is configured as patient teacher and advisor

  Scenario: Personal agent teaches value literacy as foundational life skill
    Given Kenji is shopping for groceries on his $50/week budget
    And he struggles to identify best nutritional value per dollar
    When Kenji's personal_agent analyzes his shopping choices
    Then the agent should teach him to compare nutrition per cost
    And it should explain "Brown rice gives you 8 servings for $3, while instant rice gives 4 for $4"
    And it should help him identify efficient protein sources
    And the agent should build Kenji's capability to make informed choices
    And value literacy should be taught through practice, not lectures
    And Kenji should develop skills that serve him throughout adult life

  Scenario: Building sustainable resource management patterns under constraint
    Given Kenji manages extreme resource constraint with $180/week total budget
    And his scarcity requires sophisticated planning and discipline
    When the personal_agent helps Kenji develop resource management practices
    Then it should teach budgeting, meal planning, and strategic shopping
    And it should help him distinguish needs from wants under pressure
    And it should validate that managing scarcity is skilled work
    And the agent should recognize his constraint management as capability development
    And patterns learned now should become sustainable adult habits
    And Kenji should learn that resource stewardship is care economy skill

  Scenario: Identity development beyond student role
    Given Kenji's identity is currently shaped by being a student
    And he will graduate and transition to other adult roles
    When the personal_agent supports Kenji's identity development
    Then it should recognize him as complete person beyond student status
    And it should support his interests in environmental science as life calling
    And it should help him build identity that will persist after graduation
    And it should validate his current contributions (cooking, care work) as real
    And the agent should support integrated identity across contexts
    And Kenji should develop sense of self beyond temporary student role

  Scenario: Personal burnout prevention during academic pressure
    Given Kenji faces intense academic demands during midterms and finals
    And he also must maintain work hours to pay for expenses
    When the personal_agent detects unsustainable stress patterns
    Then it should flag burnout risk explicitly
    And it should say "You've slept 4 hours three nights in a row. This is dangerous."
    And it should help him identify what must give to protect health
    And it should connect him to campus mental health resources if needed
    And crisis intervention should prioritize his survival
    And the system should validate that breaking under these demands is not failure

  Scenario: Developing cooking skills as care economy capability
    Given Kenji is learning to cook efficiently on tight budget
    And cooking is new skill he's developing as independent adult
    When the personal_agent teaches Kenji cooking techniques
    Then it should provide patient, practical instruction
    And it should teach him to plan meals that use ingredients efficiently
    And it should help him learn techniques that reduce prep time
    And the agent should recognize cooking as care economy skill
    And it should validate his progress: "You can now make 5 meals confidently"
    And Kenji should experience cooking as capability, not chore

  Scenario: Care token accumulation for self-care and household contributions
    Given Kenji prepares nutritious meals for himself
    And he manages his space, does laundry, and maintains basic self-care
    When the Value Scanner tracks Kenji's individual care contributions
    Then it should accumulate care tokens for self-care labor
    And it should recognize that caring for himself is care economy work
    And it should track his development of adult life skills
    And self-maintenance should be valued, not invisible
    And the system should make visible the work of sustaining himself
    And Kenji should see that taking care of himself is productive

  Scenario: Financial literacy development through care economy lens
    Given Kenji must manage all his finances independently
    And he receives financial aid, earns wages, and makes all spending decisions
    When the personal_agent teaches financial management
    Then it should frame finances through care economy principles
    And it should teach him to value care contributions alongside paid work
    And it should help him understand exploitation vs. fair exchange
    And the agent should build financial literacy integrated with care values
    And Kenji should learn to see economy as care exchange, not just money
    And financial capability should be built on care economy foundation

  Scenario: Privacy and autonomy as emerging independent adult
    Given Kenji is establishing adult independence
    And he has full rights to privacy in his personal life
    When care economy data is collected about Kenji
    Then he must have complete control over all personal information
    And no data should be shared with family or school without his consent
    And his adult autonomy should be respected completely
    And privacy should be default, not something he must request
    And the system should support his development of adult boundaries
    And Kenji's data sovereignty should be absolute

  Scenario: Learning to recognize own needs and ask for help
    Given Kenji is navigating adult independence for first time
    And college culture often treats struggling as weakness
    When Kenji faces challenges beyond his current capacity
    Then the personal_agent should teach him to recognize when he needs help
    And it should normalize asking for support as strength, not failure
    And it should connect him to available resources (food bank, counseling, emergency aid)
    And the agent should validate that everyone needs help sometimes
    And the system should counteract toxic independence culture
    And Kenji should learn that care economy includes receiving care

  Scenario: Time management for competing demands
    Given Kenji must balance 15 hours work, full academic load, and household responsibilities
    And time is his most constrained resource
    When the personal_agent helps Kenji manage his schedule
    Then it should teach realistic time budgeting
    And it should help him prioritize among competing demands
    And it should recognize time spent on care work as real constraint
    And the agent should validate that he cannot do everything
    And it should help him make conscious trade-offs
    And Kenji should learn sustainable pacing for long-term success

  Scenario: Building resilience through care economy participation
    Given Kenji faces significant stress and uncertainty
    And he is geographically separated from family support networks
    When the personal_agent supports Kenji's resilience development
    Then it should recognize his participation in care economy as building connection
    And it should show how his care contributions create community
    And it should validate that resilience comes from reciprocal relationships
    And the agent should help him build care networks in temporary community
    And the system should teach that care economy creates security
    And Kenji should learn that giving and receiving care builds resilience

  Scenario: Recognizing that student patterns shape adult life
    Given Kenji is forming habits and patterns that will persist
    And his college years are when adult identity and practices solidify
    When the personal_agent reflects on Kenji's pattern development
    Then it should help him see that current choices shape future self
    And it should validate that learning care economy now matters lifelong
    And it should recognize this developmental phase as formative
    And the agent should support intentional pattern-building
    And the system should help Kenji become the adult he wants to be
    And student years should be recognized as foundation-laying time
