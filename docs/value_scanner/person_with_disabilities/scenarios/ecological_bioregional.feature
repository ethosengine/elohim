Feature: Ecological Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities
  As a person with disabilities engaging with ecological and environmental systems
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want disability justice and ecological justice recognized as interconnected
  So that both movements strengthen each other toward interdependent flourishing

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the person_with_disabilities user "Alex" is registered in the system
    And Alex understands interdependence deeply through disability experience
    And Alex participates in environmental justice organizing
    And the ecological governance context is active
    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates ecological care economy
    And disability justice and environmental justice share core principles

  Scenario: Disability justice insights inform ecological care economy
    Given disability justice recognizes that no one is truly independent
    And disabled people understand interdependence as lived reality
    When the bioregional_elohim models ecological relationships
    Then disability justice principles should inform ecological thinking
    And Alex's understanding of mutual aid should shape environmental approaches
    And recognition of diverse ways of being should extend to ecological diversity
    And interdependence should be celebrated, not denied
    And the protocol should learn from disability community wisdom
    And ecological systems should embody values disability justice teaches
    And Alex's expertise about interdependence should be valued

  Scenario: Environmental accessibility enables disabled people's participation
    Given natural spaces are often inaccessible to disabled people
    And inaccessibility excludes disabled people from environmental connection
    When ecological spaces and programs are designed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should advocate for environmental accessibility
    And trails, parks, gardens should be wheelchair accessible
    And sensory accommodations should be considered
    And Alex should be able to participate in environmental care work
    And exclusion from nature compounds disability injustice
    And the protocol should recognize that accessibility is environmental justice
    And disabled people's right to nature should be protected

  Scenario: Climate crisis disproportionately harms disabled people
    Given disabled people are especially vulnerable to climate impacts
    And emergency systems often fail disabled people
    When climate adaptation is planned
    Then the bioregional_elohim should center disabled people in climate planning
    And Alex's perspective should inform climate justice strategies
    And emergency preparedness should account for disability needs
    And climate solutions should be accessible to disabled people
    And the protocol should recognize disability as environmental justice issue
    And Alex's expertise about vulnerability should guide climate work
    And resilience planning should protect most vulnerable community members

  Scenario: Connecting disability rights to environmental justice organizing
    Given both movements challenge systems that devalue certain lives
    And both require recognizing interdependence and collective care
    When Alex participates in environmental organizing
    Then the bioregional_elohim should facilitate cross-movement solidarity
    And it should help Alex build bridges between disability and environmental movements
    And it should make visible shared principles and goals
    And coalition-building should be supported and valued
    And Alex's work connecting movements should accumulate care tokens
    And the protocol should recognize that these justices are interconnected
    And Alex's bridge-building strengthens both movements

  Scenario: Sustainable living adapted for disability access
    Given sustainable practices are often designed without disability consideration
    And inaccessible sustainability excludes disabled people
    When sustainable living practices are promoted
    Then the bioregional_elohim should ensure practices are disability-accessible
    And composting, gardening, conservation should be adaptable for various capabilities
    And Alex should be able to participate in ecological practices
    And sustainable living should work for diverse bodies and minds
    And the protocol should advocate for inclusive environmental practices
    And disability expertise should improve sustainability design
    And Alex's participation should be welcomed and supported

  Scenario: Valuing diverse ways of being extends to all life
    Given disability justice rejects hierarchy of human worth
    And this principle extends to ecological relationships
    When the bioregional_elohim represents ecological values
    Then it should embody recognition of intrinsic worth across difference
    And diversity should be valued, not just tolerated
    And interdependence should be centered as strength
    And disability justice frameworks should inform ecological ethics
    And Alex's understanding of diversity as value should shape environmental thinking
    And the protocol should learn from disability community wisdom
    And respect for difference should extend from people to ecosystems

  Scenario: Environmental toxins and disability intersection
    Given environmental pollution causes and exacerbates disabilities
    And disabled people are particularly vulnerable to environmental toxins
    When environmental health is addressed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize disability-environment connections
    And it should track how environmental factors affect disabled people
    And Alex's experience should inform environmental health advocacy
    And environmental justice should include preventing disability from toxins
    And the protocol should connect environmental and disability health
    And Alex's advocacy should strengthen environmental health protections
    And prevention of environmentally-caused disability should be prioritized

  Scenario: Mutual aid practices from disability community inform ecological resilience
    Given disabled people have deep expertise in mutual aid
    And ecological resilience requires community cooperation
    When the bioregional_elohim models community resilience
    Then it should learn from disability community mutual aid practices
    And Alex's experience with peer support should inform ecological organizing
    And disability community's interdependence should model ecological relationships
    And the protocol should recognize disability community as resilience experts
    And mutual aid frameworks should be applied to ecological challenges
    And Alex's knowledge should strengthen bioregional resilience
    And disability justice practices should inform ecological care economy

  Scenario: Access to healthy food as disability and environmental justice
    Given food systems often fail disabled people and harm environment
    And Alex navigates both food access barriers and ecological concerns
    When food systems are reformed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should connect food justice to disability access
    And sustainable food should be accessible to disabled people
    And Alex should be able to participate in local food systems
    And accessibility should be integrated into food justice work
    And the protocol should recognize food as both disability and ecological issue
    And Alex's perspective should inform food system design
    And local food networks should include disabled people

  Scenario: Disability community's innovation benefits ecological adaptation
    Given disabled people are constant innovators adapting to inaccessible world
    And innovation capacity is essential for climate adaptation
    When ecological challenges require creative solutions
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize disabled people as expert innovators
    And Alex's adaptive problem-solving should be valued
    And disability community's creativity should inform climate adaptation
    And the protocol should learn from how disabled people solve access problems
    And innovation from disability should strengthen ecological resilience
    And Alex's adaptive expertise should contribute to ecological solutions
    And disability innovation should be recognized as community resource

  Scenario: Transportation justice connects disability and environmental advocacy
    Given accessible public transit reduces both carbon emissions and disability barriers
    And transportation is both disability rights and environmental issue
    When transportation systems are reformed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should advocate for accessible sustainable transit
    And Alex's transit needs should align with environmental goals
    And accessible transit should be framed as climate solution
    And disability advocates and environmentalists should work together
    And the protocol should facilitate transportation justice coalitions
    And Alex's advocacy for accessible transit serves both causes
    And sustainable transportation must include disability access

  Scenario: Bioregional belonging includes disabled people as full participants
    Given disabled people are often excluded from community belonging
    And bioregional identity requires full inclusion of all residents
    When bioregional community is defined
    Then the bioregional_elohim should include disabled people as essential members
    And Alex should be welcomed as full bioregional participant
    And disability should be recognized as part of human diversity in ecosystem
    And bioregional care economy should serve disabled members
    And Alex's contributions should be valued within bioregional context
    And the protocol should embody that everyone belongs to place
    And disabled people's relationship to land and ecosystem should be honored

  Scenario: Intergenerational ecological wisdom includes disability experience
    Given disabled elders hold knowledge about adaptation and resilience
    And disability experience across generations teaches interdependence
    When ecological knowledge is preserved and transmitted
    Then the bioregional_elohim should include disability experience in wisdom traditions
    And Alex should be recognized as holder of valuable knowledge
    And disability wisdom should be passed to future generations
    And ecological teaching should include disability justice principles
    And the protocol should honor disability experience as ecological knowledge
    And Alex's understanding of interdependence should be preserved
    And intergenerational learning should include disability community wisdom
