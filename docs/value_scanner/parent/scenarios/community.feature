Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Parent
  As a parent participating in civic life while raising children
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want my parenting recognized as community contribution
  So that raising citizens is valued as essential civic work

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah participates in her community through schools, organizations, and civic life
    And Sarah is raising future citizens Tommy and Emma
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim coordinates community care economy
    And Sarah's parenting is community work, not just private family matter

  Scenario: Parenting recognized as community care contribution
    Given Sarah is raising children who will become community members
    And she is preparing them for civic participation and social responsibility
    When the community_elohim tracks Sarah's contributions
    Then it should recognize parenting as community-building work
    And raising future citizens should be valued as civic labor
    And Sarah's parenting should accumulate community care tokens
    And her work should be recognized as essential to community continuity
    And parenting should be understood as public good, not private consumption
    And the community should value child-rearing as collective investment

  Scenario: Parent participation in school governance and advocacy
    Given Sarah participates in school board meetings and parent committees
    And she advocates for better educational policies
    When the community_elohim tracks Sarah's civic engagement
    Then it should recognize school participation as care labor
    And advocacy for children's education should accumulate care tokens
    And parent organizing should be valued as political work
    And Sarah's effort to improve schools should be community contribution
    And the system should recognize that parents are primary education stakeholders
    And civic labor should be visible and valued

  Scenario: Community care tokens enable resource access for families
    Given Sarah has accumulated care tokens through parenting and civic participation
    And community resources are allocated partially based on care economy
    When Sarah's family needs community support
    Then her care tokens should give standing in resource decisions
    And the community should provide support based on her contributions
    And care economy should enable reciprocity between family and community
    And those who contribute care should receive care in return
    And the system should create sustainable community mutual aid
    And parenting contributions should translate to community support

  Scenario: Parent networks coordinate community-wide childcare infrastructure
    Given multiple families need reliable, affordable childcare
    And current market solutions are inadequate
    When the community_elohim coordinates childcare infrastructure
    Then it should enable parent-led cooperative childcare
    And it should help organize community-owned childcare centers
    And parent labor should be valued in cooperative structures
    And care tokens should enable access regardless of income
    And the community should build childcare as commons, not commodity
    And the system should enable collective solutions to care needs

  Scenario: Community recognition of parent expertise in child development
    Given Sarah has professional-grade expertise in child development
    And she is an experienced teacher and parent
    When the community seeks expertise on children's issues
    Then Sarah's knowledge should be valued and consulted
    And parent expertise should be recognized alongside professional credentials
    And she should be invited to community policy discussions
    And her care tokens should reflect her knowledge contributions
    And the community should tap parent expertise for decision-making
    And parenting experience should be valued as legitimate expertise

  Scenario: Community support for parent mental health and well-being
    Given parenting is intense work with high burnout risk
    And Sarah needs community support to sustain care work
    When the community_elohim assesses parent well-being
    Then it should connect Sarah to mental health resources
    And it should provide respite care and support services
    And the community should invest in parent sustainability
    And parent well-being should be recognized as community priority
    And the system should prevent parent burnout through community care
    And supporting parents should be understood as supporting children

  Scenario: Parent organizing for family-friendly community policies
    Given community policies affect families' quality of life
    And Sarah wants better parks, libraries, family resources
    When parents organize for policy change
    Then the community_elohim should facilitate collective advocacy
    And it should coordinate parent political power
    And organizing labor should accumulate care tokens
    And Sarah's advocacy should be recognized as community contribution
    And parent collective action should be amplified by care economy
    And the system should translate care work into political power

  Scenario: Community cultural events and intergenerational connection
    Given communities thrive on cultural connection and celebration
    And Sarah wants children integrated into community life
    When the community_elohim coordinates cultural events
    Then it should facilitate family participation in community culture
    And it should recognize Sarah's work bringing children to events
    And cultural transmission should be valued as care labor
    And intergenerational community events should be prioritized
    And the system should build community bonds across generations
    And family participation should strengthen community cohesion

  Scenario: Community emergency preparedness includes family needs
    Given emergencies affect families with unique challenges
    And children have specific needs during crisis
    When the community_elohim coordinates emergency preparedness
    Then it should ensure family needs are centered in planning
    And Sarah's knowledge of family needs should inform planning
    And emergency care resources should include childcare and family support
    And parent expertise should shape community resilience
    And the system should recognize that community safety includes child safety
    And family preparedness should be community priority

  Scenario: Community economic support recognizes parenting as work
    Given Sarah performs enormous care labor essential to community
    And traditional economy renders this work unpaid
    When the community implements care economy principles
    Then parenting should be recognized as valuable economic contribution
    And care tokens could translate to community currency or benefits
    And Sarah should have economic support for her care work
    And the community should invest in parents as essential workers
    And care economy should provide material support, not just recognition
    And the system should enable economic justice for caregivers

  Scenario: Community learning spaces for parent education and support
    Given parents need ongoing education and skill development
    And Sarah both teaches and learns from other parents
    When the community_elohim coordinates parent education
    Then it should provide spaces for parent learning and skill-sharing
    And it should recognize teaching labor and learning participation
    And parent education should be accessible and valued
    And the community should invest in parent capability-building
    And the system should create communities of practice for parents
    And parenting skills should be continuously developed

  Scenario: Community accountability for supporting families
    Given communities depend on families raising next generation
    And Sarah's parenting work benefits entire community
    When the community_elohim tracks community support for families
    Then it should measure whether community is adequately supporting parents
    And it should identify gaps in family resources and support
    And it should create accountability for community investment in children
    And the system should ensure communities reciprocate for parent contributions
    And care economy should make community obligations to families visible
    And the community should be accountable for enabling parent success
