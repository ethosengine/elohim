Feature: Household Care Coordination for Workers
  As a worker living in a shared household
  I need to coordinate care work fairly with roommates
  So that household responsibilities don't overwhelm me on top of employment demands

  Background:
    Given I am a worker sharing an apartment with roommates
    And my irregular work schedule complicates household coordination
    And household care work is distributed among members
    And the protocol tracks care contributions

  Scenario: Making household contributions visible
    Given I contribute to household care when my schedule allows
    Including shopping, cooking, cleaning, and bills management
    When household members want to understand contribution distribution
    Then the protocol should make all care work visible
    And show my contributions relative to available time
    And recognize that my irregular schedule affects participation
    And facilitate fair distribution accounting for work constraints

  Scenario: Coordinating shared meals around work schedules
    Given my roommates and I want to share meal costs and preparation
    And my work schedule is unpredictable and changes weekly
    When we plan shared meals
    Then the protocol should coordinate across different schedules
    And identify opportunities when I can participate
    And help distribute cooking responsibilities fairly
    And allow flexible contribution when my schedule permits

  Scenario: Managing shared grocery shopping efficiently
    Given household members pool resources for shared groceries
    And I have limited time for shopping due to work
    When the household needs groceries
    Then the protocol should optimize shared shopping lists
    And coordinate who shops when based on availability
    And track shared expenses fairly
    And minimize my individual shopping burden through cooperation

  Scenario: Distributing household tasks based on capacity
    Given different household members have different time and energy
    And my work leaves me with minimal capacity
    When we allocate household responsibilities
    Then the protocol should suggest distribution based on actual capacity
    And recognize that my 50+ hour work week limits my availability
    And propose fair alternatives when I can't do time-intensive tasks
    And help us find equitable arrangements

  Scenario: Sharing meal prep to reduce individual burden
    Given cooking for one is inefficient and exhausting
    When household members batch cook or share meals
    Then the protocol should coordinate shared meal preparation
    And track who cooks, who cleans, and who benefits
    And help us establish sustainable shared cooking rhythms
    And recognize this cooperation as care economy practice

  Scenario: Accessing household support during crisis periods
    Given work demands sometimes become overwhelming
    When I am working double shifts or experiencing crisis
    Then the protocol should facilitate household mutual aid
    And help roommates understand my temporary extra needs
    And suggest how others can support me during difficult periods
    And enable reciprocity when my situation improves

  Scenario: Managing shared household budget
    Given household members share rent and utilities
    And my income is limited and variable
    When we manage shared expenses
    Then the protocol should track contributions transparently
    And accommodate my tight budget constraints
    And facilitate fair cost distribution
    And help us optimize shared household economics

  Scenario: Coordinating household care during schedule conflicts
    Given my work schedule conflicts with household needs
    When household tasks need completion and I am working
    Then the protocol should help coordinate coverage
    And enable roommates to handle urgent needs
    And track that I contribute when available
    And maintain fairness over time despite schedule conflicts

  Scenario: Creating household care agreements
    Given household members need clear expectations
    When we establish how we'll manage shared living
    Then the protocol should help us create care agreements
    And document who does what and when
    And include flexibility for my irregular schedule
    And provide framework for fair and sustainable cooperation

  Scenario: Recognizing household labor in care economy
    Given all household work is care contribution
    When household members clean, cook, maintain, and organize
    Then the protocol should recognize this as valuable care work
    And accumulate care tokens for household contributions
    And make visible that domestic labor supports everyone's flourishing
    And validate that this work deserves recognition even though unpaid

  Scenario: Resolving household care conflicts
    Given household care distribution may become imbalanced
    When conflicts arise about who is contributing fairly
    Then the protocol should provide objective contribution data
    And facilitate conversations about fairness and capacity
    And help us identify solutions that work for everyone
    And support negotiation toward sustainable arrangements

  Scenario: Building household resilience through cooperation
    Given shared households can pool resources and reduce individual burden
    When we practice care economy cooperation
    Then the protocol should help us maximize mutual benefit
    And identify opportunities for efficiency through sharing
    And support us in building household community
    And demonstrate that cooperative care reduces costs and increases well-being
