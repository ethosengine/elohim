# Elder - Social Medium

## Archetype

An elder user represents older adults (typically 65+) who seek meaningful connection, wish to share accumulated wisdom, and desire to remain engaged with family and community. In the Social Medium context, elders maintain dignity and autonomy while being protected from exploitation. The system adapts to their needs without infantilizing them, ensuring bad actors can't exploit cognitive changes while preserving full agency and participation.

Key characteristics:
- Age range: Typically 65+ years old, though wisdom-keeper role can begin earlier
- Rich life experience and accumulated knowledge to share
- May face isolation due to distance from family, mobility limitations, or life transitions
- Needs protection from financial scams, romance cons, and health fraud
- Values genuine connection over superficial interaction
- Often has traditional skills, cultural knowledge, or historical memory to contribute
- Maintains full autonomy while receiving appropriate protection
