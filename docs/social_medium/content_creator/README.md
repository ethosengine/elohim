# Content Creator - Social Medium

## Archetype

A content creator is someone who produces educational, cultural, artistic, or informational content for communities. Unlike traditional social media influencers who optimize for engagement, Elohim content creators earn reach through genuine value, quality, and community appreciation. They include educators, journalists, artists, documentarians, cultural preservationists, and community storytellers who prioritize truth and service over viral growth.

Key characteristics:

- Maintains creative freedom while respecting community standards
