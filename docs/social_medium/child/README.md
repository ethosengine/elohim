# Child - Social Medium

## Archetype

A child user represents young people (ages 8-17) learning to navigate digital space safely and wisely. In the Social Medium context, children have protected profiles that start with minimal reach and expand gradually as they demonstrate good judgment. The system prioritizes protection through design while actively creating age-appropriate opportunities for growth, creative expression, and community participation.

Key characteristics:
- Age range: 8-17 years old (profile evolves with age and demonstrated wisdom)
- Starts with family-only reach, gradually expanding to neighborhood and beyond
- Protected from exploitation, harmful content, and predatory behavior
- Learns digital wisdom through experience rather than just restriction
- Earns expanded reach through positive contributions and good judgment
- Has access to mentors, educational resources, and creative spaces

## Core Needs

- **Safety Through Design**: Protection from predators, harmful content, and exploitation without feeling isolated or controlled
- **Graduated Autonomy**: System that expands their reach and capabilities as they demonstrate wisdom and good judgment
- **Age-Appropriate Expression**: Safe spaces for creativity, learning, and self-expression matched to their developmental stage
- **Meaningful Connection**: Ability to maintain relationships with family, friends, neighbors, and mentors
- **Digital Wisdom Development**: Learning through experience that contribution earns reach, evidence matters, and community care creates opportunity

## Key Relationships

- **elder**: Learns from elders' wisdom, receives mentorship, participates in intergenerational connection
- **content_creator**: Engages with age-appropriate educational and creative content, learns creation skills
- **community_moderator**: Protected by moderators who maintain safe spaces and respond to concerns

- **Mentorship Matching**: Safe connection with vetted adult mentors in areas of interest
- **Privacy by Default**: Child's contributions don't travel beyond intended audience without explicit consent

- **No Monetization**: Children's data and attention never monetized or exploited
- **Educational Integration**: Seamless connection with school systems and educational resources
