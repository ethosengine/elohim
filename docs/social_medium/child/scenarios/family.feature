Feature: Family Communication and Safety for Child
  As a child in the social_medium system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to communicate safely with my family and learn digital wisdom
  So that I can build healthy relationships while protected from harm

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the child user is registered in the system
    And the family governance context is active
    And the child is Emma, age 8, with parental guidance enabled

  Scenario: Child creates first contribution within family circle
    Given Emma wants to share her art project with her family
    When she creates a contribution with a photo of her drawing
    And she writes "I made this at school today!"
    Then the contribution is immediately visible to all family members
    And it stays within the family circle by default
    And family members can respond with encouragement
    And the guardian agent tracks this as positive creative expression
    And Emma learns that sharing creates connection

  Scenario: Child's gradual reach expansion through good judgment
    Given Emma has been using the system for 6 months
    And she consistently makes kind, thoughtful contributions
    And she helps her younger sibling with homework via the system
    And she shares creative work that delights her family
    When the guardian agent evaluates her demonstrated wisdom
    Then her reach is expanded to include vetted neighborhood children
    And her parents receive notification of the expanded access
    And Emma is congratulated for earning greater trust
    And she gains access to age-appropriate neighborhood activities
    And safety protections remain fully active

  Scenario: Child blocked from exposure to harmful content
    Given Emma's uncle shares a news article about violence
    And the content is appropriate for adults but not children
    When the article is contributed to the family space
    Then the guardian agent evaluates age-appropriateness
    And Emma's view is automatically filtered or summarized
    And her parents can choose to discuss the topic with her directly
    And Emma never sees graphic or traumatizing content
    And family communication continues without disruption

  Scenario: Child receives help during distress
    Given Emma is upset about something that happened at school
    When she creates a contribution expressing her distress
    And the guardian agent detects emotional crisis indicators
    Then her parents are immediately notified with sensitivity
    And age-appropriate support resources are surfaced
    And family members can provide comfort and guidance
    And if needed, connection to counseling resources is offered
    And Emma experiences the system as safe space to express feelings
