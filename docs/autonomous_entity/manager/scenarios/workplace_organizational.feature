Feature: Democratic Coordination in Workplace for Manager
  As a manager in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer
  I want to facilitate effective coordination without domination
  So that operations function smoothly while respecting worker autonomy

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Marcus serves as democratic coordinator at ChickenMax
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active
    And governance is genuinely democratic, not hierarchical theater

  Scenario: Manager facilitates scheduling through negotiation, not command
    Given workers need coordinated schedule balancing operational and personal needs
    And corporate model had Marcus impose schedule unilaterally
    When scheduling conflicts arise
    Then Marcus proposes schedule based on operational requirements
    And Marcus facilitates negotiation between workers with competing needs
    And workers modify proposal based on their life circumstances
    And workers democratically approve final schedule
    And Marcus cannot override worker decision
    And workplace_elohim ensures process remains democratic

  Scenario: Manager proposes operational changes requiring democratic approval
    Given Marcus identifies efficiency improvement opportunity
    And corporate model would have him implement changes by fiat
    When Marcus wants to implement the operational change
    Then Marcus presents proposal to worker council with clear rationale
    And workers deliberate on benefits and potential downsides
    And workers ask clarifying questions Marcus answers transparently
    And workers vote on whether to adopt the change
    And if approved, Marcus coordinates implementation
    And if rejected, Marcus accepts decision and proposes alternatives

  Scenario: Manager mediates conflict without imposing judgment
    Given two workers have disagreement about task allocation
    And corporate model had Marcus impose solution or discipline both
    When workers bring conflict to Marcus for mediation
    Then Marcus facilitates structured conversation between parties
    And Marcus helps each worker express their perspective and needs
    And Marcus proposes potential compromise solutions
    And workers, not Marcus, decide on resolution
    And workplace_elohim documents process ensuring fairness
    And conflict resolves through dialogue, not managerial authority

  Scenario: Manager's facilitation effectiveness is democratically evaluated
    Given workers want accountability for coordinator role
    And corporate model had no worker input on manager performance
    When quarterly facilitation review occurs
    Then workers provide feedback on Marcus's coordination effectiveness
    And workers rate his facilitation skills, transparency, and respect for autonomy
    And feedback informs Marcus's continued development
    And poor evaluations trigger support and training, not immediate termination
    And sustained poor performance enables democratic recall
    And workplace_elohim ensures fair evaluation process

  Scenario: Manager provides operational expertise without information asymmetry
    Given Marcus has knowledge of inventory levels, supplier costs, and operational data
    And corporate model used information asymmetry to maintain power
    When Marcus uses operational information for coordination
    Then all data Marcus sees is equally visible to workers
    And Marcus cannot hoard information to manipulate outcomes
    And workers access same dashboards, reports, and metrics
    And Marcus's value comes from synthesizing information, not controlling it
    And workplace_elohim ensures transparency of all operational data

  Scenario: Manager coordinates customer feedback without targeting individuals
    Given customers provide feedback about service and quality
    And corporate model had Marcus use feedback to discipline workers
    When customer feedback arrives
    Then Marcus aggregates patterns without targeting individuals
    And Marcus presents feedback trends to worker council
    And workers discuss how to address systemic issues collaboratively
    And individual worker incidents are handled through peer process, not manager discipline
    And workplace_elohim prevents feedback from becoming surveillance weapon

  Scenario: Manager transitions operational knowledge to worker collective over time
    Given Marcus holds tacit knowledge from years of operations management
    And democratic model requires distributing this knowledge to workers
    When knowledge transfer process begins
    Then Marcus documents operational procedures and decision frameworks
    And Marcus trains workers in business operations through structured learning
    And workers gradually take on tasks previously Marcus's sole domain
    And after 18 months, workers govern operations with Marcus in purely advisory role
    And workplace_elohim tracks knowledge distribution preventing re-concentration

  Scenario: Manager coordinates supply chain logistics while workers govern relationships
    Given workers democratically selected Johnson Farm as supplier
    And day-to-day ordering and logistics needs coordination
    When supply chain operations continue
    Then Marcus manages ordering logistics and inventory tracking
    And Marcus coordinates deliveries and quality checks
    But workers govern supplier relationship and strategic decisions
    And Marcus cannot unilaterally change suppliers or negotiate major terms
    And his coordination role enables worker governance, not replaces it

  Scenario: Manager facilitates worker council meetings without controlling agenda
    Given worker councils meet weekly for governance decisions
    And corporate model had Marcus control meeting agenda and outcomes
    When worker council convenes
    Then workers set meeting agenda, not Marcus
    And Marcus facilitates discussion to keep meeting productive
    And Marcus ensures all voices are heard but doesn't dominate discussion
    And workers make decisions through democratic process Marcus facilitates
    And workplace_elohim monitors for subtle manipulation or agenda control

  Scenario: Manager's proposals can be rejected without retaliation
    Given Marcus proposes operational change he believes is beneficial
    And workers deliberate and vote to reject the proposal
    When rejection occurs
    Then Marcus accepts worker decision gracefully
    And Marcus does not retaliate through subtle means
    And Marcus proposes alternative approaches respecting worker concerns
    And workers know their democratic power is real, not performative
    And workplace_elohim ensures rejected proposals don't resurface as subtle coercion

  Scenario: Manager participates in democratic ownership as worker-peer
    Given Marcus's coordinator role doesn't exclude him from worker-ownership
    And his governance weight reflects his facilitation contribution
    When major strategic decisions are made (profit distribution, reinvestment, etc.)
    Then Marcus participates as worker-owner with weighted voice
    And his coordination role is valued but doesn't grant special ownership privilege
    And his tokens accumulate based on witnessed contribution like all workers
    And he benefits from collective success he helps facilitate
    And workplace_elohim prevents coordinator role from becoming ownership concentration
