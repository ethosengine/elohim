Feature: Municipal Economic Development Through Democratic Business Conversion
  As a small_business_owner in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want my business conversion to contribute to citywide economic democracy
  So that municipal policy supports democratic ownership and other owners can follow

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Rosa's Auto Repair conversion is part of emerging municipal democratic economy
    And the municipality governance context is active
    And municipal government is beginning to recognize worker ownership benefits

  Scenario: Successful conversion demonstrates viability to municipal economic development officials
    Given city economic development typically subsidizes corporate expansion
    And officials are skeptical of alternative ownership models
    When Rosa's conversion proves successful with documented outcomes
    Then municipality sees concrete evidence: workers earning living wages without subsidies
    And job quality improves (higher wages, benefits, ownership) without tax breaks
    And community institution is preserved, not destroyed by corporate acquisition
    And municipal economic development data shows democratic ownership creates better outcomes
    And municipality_elohim provides officials with impact documentation

  Scenario: Municipal business licensing and regulation adapt to democratic ownership
    Given regulations were designed for traditional hierarchical businesses
    And democratic governance may not fit standard regulatory categories
    When Rosa's Auto navigates municipal licensing as democratic enterprise
    Then business license accurately reflects worker-owned cooperative structure
    And regulatory compliance is streamlined for democratic businesses
    And municipal officials learn how to support rather than obstruct conversions
    And regulatory framework evolves to accommodate democratic governance
    And municipality_elohim coordinates with officials to develop supportive policies

  Scenario: City procurement policies begin prioritizing democratic businesses
    Given municipality purchases vehicles and services from private vendors
    And public procurement can support democratic economy development
    When Rosa's Auto bids for city fleet maintenance contracts
    Then municipal procurement gives preference to worker-owned businesses
    And democratic enterprises compete successfully for public contracts
    And taxpayer money supports living wages and community wealth, not corporate extraction
    And procurement policy changes demonstrate municipal commitment to economic democracy
    And municipality_elohim tracks procurement impacts on democratic business viability

  Scenario: Municipal tax revenue stability increases through worker ownership
    Given small business failure drains municipal tax base
    And worker-owned businesses show higher survival rates and stability
    When Rosa's conversion demonstrates enhanced business sustainability
    Then municipality experiences more stable tax revenue from democratic businesses
    And higher worker wages generate increased income tax revenue
    And business continuity maintains property tax base
    And city fiscal planners recognize democratic ownership reduces revenue volatility
    And municipality_elohim documents tax revenue benefits for policy advocacy

  Scenario: Owner advocates for municipal policies supporting exit-to-community conversions
    Given Rosa's successful transition positions her as credible advocate
    And municipal policy could support or obstruct future conversions
    When Rosa testifies to city council about conversion benefits
    Then her personal story demonstrates exit-to-community is dignified and viable
    And she advocates for: business conversion support programs and community investment tax credits
    And city council hears directly from small business owner who chose democratic path
    And her advocacy influences municipal economic development strategy
    And municipality_elohim coordinates advocate network across converted owners

  Scenario: Municipal small business support programs incorporate democratic conversion pathways
    Given city offers small business loans, technical assistance, and development support
    And these programs could facilitate democratic conversions
    When municipality recognizes conversion potential for struggling businesses
    Then small business support programs add worker ownership conversion option
    And struggling owners learn they can exit with dignity while protecting workers
    And municipal economic development staff are trained in democratic transition support
    And public resources help overcome conversion barriers (legal costs, financing, technical assistance)
    And municipality_elohim provides conversion expertise to municipal programs

  Scenario: Citywide democratic business network emerges from successful conversions
    Given Rosa's conversion inspires other small business owners
    And isolated democratic businesses are vulnerable
    When multiple conversions create critical mass across municipality
    Then democratic business network provides mutual support and coordination
    And owners considering conversion can learn from Rosa and others
    And network advocates collectively for supportive municipal policies
    And citywide democratic economy infrastructure develops (shared services, coordination, advocacy)
    And municipality_elohim facilitates network development and coordination

  Scenario: Municipal economic development metrics expand beyond job quantity to job quality
    Given cities typically measure economic development by jobs created
    And job quality (wages, benefits, dignity, ownership) is often ignored
    When Rosa's conversion demonstrates high-quality job creation
    Then municipality tracks worker ownership, living wages, and benefits in economic development data
    And democratic conversions score highly on job quality metrics
    And city economic development strategy prioritizes quality over quantity
    And officials recognize one living-wage worker-owner job exceeds three poverty-wage positions
    And municipality_elohim provides quality-focused metrics and documentation

  Scenario: Local financial institutions develop lending products for democratic conversions
    Given banks lack experience financing worker ownership transitions
    And conversion financing barriers limit democratic economy growth
    When Rosa's successful conversion demonstrates creditworthiness of democratic model
    Then local banks and credit unions develop conversion lending products
    And community development financial institutions (CDFIs) prioritize democratic business
    And municipal policy supports conversion lending through guarantees or partnerships
    And financial infrastructure emerges for scaling democratic conversions citywide
    And municipality_elohim coordinates with financial institutions on product development

  Scenario: Municipal land use and zoning protect community businesses from displacement
    Given commercial real estate speculation threatens community institutions
    And Rosa's Auto could face displacement through rising rents or property sale
    When democratic ownership is recognized as community benefit
    Then zoning policies prioritize long-term community business tenancy
    And city explores community land trusts for commercial space
    And democratic businesses receive preference in publicly-owned commercial properties
    And land use policy protects against speculation displacing community institutions
    And municipality_elohim advocates for commercial anti-displacement policies

  Scenario: City celebrates democratic conversions as municipal economic development success
    Given economic development announcements typically celebrate corporate recruitment
    And democratic conversions deserve equal municipal recognition
    When Rosa's conversion and others reach significant milestones
    Then mayor and city council publicly celebrate worker ownership transitions
    And municipal communications highlight democratic economy as development strategy
    And public celebration builds community awareness and political support
    And recognition encourages other small business owners to consider conversion
    And municipality_elohim coordinates celebration events amplifying democratic economy visibility

  Scenario: Municipal workforce development integrates democratic business training
    Given city workforce programs train workers for traditional employment
    And democratic governance requires different skills (facilitation, collaboration, shared decision-making)
    When municipality recognizes democratic businesses need prepared workers
    Then workforce development programs include cooperative business training
    And workers learn democratic governance skills alongside technical skills
    And community colleges offer worker ownership and democratic management courses
    And municipal investment in workforce development supports democratic economy growth
    And municipality_elohim develops democratic business curriculum for workforce programs
