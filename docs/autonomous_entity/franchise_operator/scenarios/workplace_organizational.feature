Feature: Workplace Transformation from Franchise Control to Democratic Governance
  As a franchise_operator in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer
  I want to facilitate conversion from corporate franchise to democratic workplace
  So that workers gain autonomy and business serves community not distant corporation

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And James's three ChickenMax franchises are converting to EAE network
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active
    And franchise agreement termination is in process

  Scenario: Franchise surveillance systems convert to worker-controlled witness infrastructure
    Given corporate-mandated cameras monitored workers for compliance and speedup
    And surveillance served corporate extraction, not worker protection
    When conversion disconnects corporate surveillance feed
    Then cameras network to local Elohim node under worker control
    And footage protects workers from customer harassment and safety violations
    And surveillance data cannot be used for discipline or productivity pressure
    And workers democratically govern when and how footage is accessed
    And workplace_elohim ensures corporate has no backdoor access to surveillance

  Scenario: Corporate-mandated operational procedures are evaluated and selectively preserved
    Given franchise required standardized procedures (some useful, others extractive)
    And workers had no voice in which procedures served quality vs. extraction
    When democratic governance reviews all franchise operational requirements
    Then health and safety protocols are preserved and improved
    And useful training structures are kept while eliminating degrading aspects
    And extractive mechanisms (bathroom time limits, speedup metrics) are eliminated
    And workers decide democratically which standards serve quality and dignity
    And workplace_elohim documents procedural changes and rationale

  Scenario: Mandatory franchise purchasing is replaced by democratic supplier relationships
    Given franchise agreement required purchasing from corporate-approved vendors at markup
    And local suppliers offering better quality and prices were prohibited
    When purchasing autonomy is restored through franchise termination
    Then workers establish direct relationships with Johnson Farm and local distributors
    And supply costs decrease 30% through eliminating corporate markup
    And quality improves through local sourcing and worker choice
    And supplier relationships become partnerships, not corporate-mandated transactions
    And workplace_elohim coordinates supply chain across EAE network

  Scenario: Franchise menu constraints are lifted enabling local adaptation
    Given corporate mandated standardized menu prohibiting innovation
    And community requested options (vegan, healthier choices) were impossible to offer
    When menu control transfers to democratic worker governance
    Then workers add menu items responding to neighborhood preferences
    And seasonal offerings use Johnson Farm's available produce
    And cultural preferences of diverse community are reflected in menu
    And innovation serves local needs rather than distant corporate standardization
    And workplace_elohim tracks customer satisfaction with democratized menu

  Scenario: Workers transition from implementing franchise extraction to democratic coordination
    Given workers were required to enforce franchise policies regardless of harm
    And implementation of extraction created moral injury and worker resentment
    When democratic governance replaces franchise control
    Then workers coordinate operations based on collective wisdom, not corporate mandates
    And schedule flexibility serves workers' family needs, not corporate efficiency demands
    And customer service becomes genuine care, not scripted performance
    And workplace becomes site of flourishing, not extraction enforcement
    And workplace_elohim supports workers' growing democratic governance capacity

  Scenario: Franchise operator role (if staying) transforms from controller to facilitator
    Given James controlled workers because franchise corporate controlled him
    And hierarchical enforcement was required by franchise agreement
    When James stays as transition steward facilitating democratic conversion
    Then his role shifts from implementing corporate mandates to supporting worker autonomy
    And operational expertise becomes consultation, not commands
    And workers request his input because it's valuable, not because he's boss
    And franchise termination liberates him to serve rather than control
    And workplace_elohim ensures steward role doesn't recreate hierarchy

  Scenario: Franchise brand transition occurs with community communication
    Given locations were known as ChickenMax #247, #248, #249
    And brand change could confuse or alienate customers
    When democratic governance decides on rebranding strategy
    Then some locations may de-brand (ChickenMax → Maria's Kitchen)
    And others may maintain brand temporarily during transition
    And customers are informed: same workers, democratic ownership, community commitment
    And brand transition communicates values shift from corporate to community
    And workplace_elohim manages customer communication during rebranding

  Scenario: Franchise fee elimination creates immediate value distribution dividend
    Given corporate extracted $30K franchise fee + $18K marketing fee per location annually
    And mandatory purchasing added 30% markup ($50K+ annually per location)
    When franchise termination eliminates all corporate extraction
    Then $100K+ annually per location is freed for redistribution
    And workers receive substantial wage increases (60% of freed value)
    And community programs are funded (30% of freed value)
    And sustainability investments are made (10% of freed value)
    And workplace_elohim documents value circulation replacing extraction

  Scenario: Multi-location franchise conversion creates worker coordination opportunities
    Given James's three locations previously competed for corporate favor
    And workers at different locations didn't coordinate or support each other
    When all three locations convert to democratic EAE network simultaneously
    Then workers across locations share learning and mutual support
    And successful practices at one location spread to others
    And workers can transfer between locations while maintaining ownership stakes
    And collective bargaining power increases through multi-location coordination
    And workplace_elohim facilitates inter-location worker collaboration

  Scenario: Turnover decreases dramatically as workers gain ownership and dignity
    Given franchise locations experienced 150% annual turnover due to low wages and poor conditions
    And constant turnover harmed service quality and training efficiency
    When conversion provides ownership, living wages, and democratic voice
    Then worker retention improves to 90%+ (turnover drops to 10% annually)
    And institutional knowledge accumulates instead of constantly draining
    And training investments pay off through worker longevity
    And customer relationships deepen through consistent staffing
    And workplace_elohim documents retention improvements and cost savings

  Scenario: Corporate quality standards are exceeded through worker ownership and pride
    Given franchise corporate claimed standardization ensured quality
    And workers had no stake in quality beyond avoiding discipline
    When democratic ownership gives workers direct stake in quality outcomes
    Then food quality improves because workers care about product they own
    And customer service excellence emerges from genuine worker engagement
    And cleanliness and maintenance improve through ownership pride
    And quality exceeds previous franchise corporate standards
    And workplace_elohim documents quality improvements post-conversion

  Scenario: Franchise termination negotiation succeeds through EAE network support
    Given franchise corporations resist terminations protecting extraction revenue
    And individual operators have limited leverage against corporate legal resources
    When EAE network coordinates multi-location conversion support
    Then legal expertise is shared across conversions reducing costs
    And coordinated multi-location terminations increase negotiating leverage
    And public narrative (corporate bullying democratic workplaces) pressures franchise corporate
    And termination succeeds protecting workers and enabling democratic ownership
    And workplace_elohim coordinates franchise termination strategy across network
