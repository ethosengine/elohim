Feature: Food Service Industry Transformation Through Franchise Conversions
  As a franchise_operator in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the industry_sector governance layer
  I want to participate in democratizing food service industry
  So that franchise extraction model is replaced by democratic coordination

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And James's ChickenMax conversions are part of broader food service transformation
    And the industry_sector governance context is active
    And multiple franchise operators are considering democratic conversion

  Scenario: Successful franchise conversion demonstrates sector-wide alternative to extraction
    Given franchise model dominates food service through extraction and control
    And industry assumes extraction is necessary for operational efficiency
    When James's conversions prove democratic operation outperforms franchise
    Then food service sector sees concrete evidence of viable alternative
    And higher worker wages, better quality, and lower prices coexist through eliminating extraction
    And industry narrative shifts from "franchise is only scalable model" to "democratic is superior"
    And other franchise operators observe and consider conversion
    And industry_sector_elohim documents superior performance metrics for advocacy

  Scenario: Franchise operator network emerges supporting democratic conversions
    Given franchise operators are typically isolated competing for corporate favor
    And isolation prevents collective action against corporate extraction
    When James connects with other operators considering conversion
    Then franchise operator solidarity network forms
    And operators share conversion strategies, legal resources, and emotional support
    And coordinated multi-operator conversions increase leverage in corporate negotiations
    And operator-to-operator mentoring spreads democratic conversion knowledge
    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates operator network development and coordination

  Scenario: Democratic food service supply chain coordination outcompetes franchise purchasing
    Given franchise mandatory purchasing extracts through 30% markup on supplies
    And individual democratic locations lack volume purchasing power
    When EAE network coordinates purchasing across converted franchise locations
    Then volume purchasing power matches or exceeds franchise corporate leverage
    And democratic coordination eliminates markup (suppliers paid fairly, buyers pay less)
    And supply chain becomes transparent partnership, not extractive mandate
    And food service sector learns democratic coordination provides efficiency without extraction
    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates democratic supply chain across network

  Scenario: Franchise corporate faces systemic challenge from conversion movement
    Given each franchise conversion reduces corporate extraction revenue
    And corporate business model depends on franchise fee and purchasing extraction
    When conversions reach critical mass across food service sector
    Then franchise corporate faces existential threat to extraction model
    And corporate resistance intensifies (legal threats, termination fights, operator intimidation)
    And public narrative battle reveals franchise extraction to consumers and workers
    And sector transformation accelerates as corporate resistance exposes model's exploitative nature
    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates resistance strategy and public narrative

  Scenario: Food service workers across sector gain conversion knowledge and power
    Given workers at non-converted franchises observe democratic locations thriving
    And word spreads about $18/hour wages, ownership, and democratic voice
    When worker organizing across food service sector references democratic conversions
    Then workers demand democratic conversion or equivalent improvements at their locations
    And franchise operators face worker pressure to convert or match democratic conditions
    And worker power increases sector-wide through demonstration effect
    And sector-wide organizing becomes possible through democratic model inspiration
    And industry_sector_elohim supports cross-location worker organizing and education

  Scenario: Industry quality standards improve through democratic governance demonstration
    Given franchise standardization claimed to ensure quality but often degraded it
    And profit maximization pressured operators to cut quality whenever possible
    When democratic locations demonstrate higher quality through worker ownership
    Then industry benchmarks shift toward democratic quality standards
    And customers learn to expect better quality from democratically-operated establishments
    And competitive pressure forces remaining franchises to improve quality
    And sector reputation improves through democratic operations raising standards
    And industry_sector_elohim documents quality improvements and best practices

  Scenario: Franchise operator transitions become industry sector leadership development
    Given converted operators have unique expertise in franchise-to-democratic conversion
    And sector transformation requires knowledgeable advocates and mentors
    When James and other converted operators share learning across industry
    Then they become thought leaders in food service democratic transformation
    And industry conferences feature democratic conversion case studies
    And sector media covers democratic model as emerging alternative to franchise
    And operators' expertise guides policy development and network expansion
    And industry_sector_elohim amplifies converted operators' voices in sector transformation

  Scenario: Food service training and certification evolves to include democratic governance
    Given industry training focuses on franchise compliance and hierarchical management
    And democratic operations require different skills (facilitation, collaboration, transparency)
    When democratic food service network reaches scale
    Then industry training programs add democratic governance and worker ownership modules
    And certification standards recognize cooperative business competencies
    And culinary schools and hospitality programs teach democratic operation
    And sector workforce development supports democratic model proliferation
    And industry_sector_elohim develops democratic food service training curriculum

  Scenario: Sector-wide environmental sustainability improves through democratic coordination
    Given franchise model externalizes environmental costs for profit maximization
    And individual locations lack power to demand sustainable supply chains
    When democratic network coordinates for environmental stewardship sector-wide
    Then local sourcing increases, reducing food miles and supporting regenerative agriculture
    And waste reduction practices spread through network sharing best practices
    And sustainable packaging becomes standard through coordinated purchasing
    And environmental accountability increases through democratic governance transparency
    And industry_sector_elohim tracks sector environmental improvements from democratic coordination

  Scenario: Industry investment patterns shift toward democratic enterprise financing
    Given traditional food service finance supports franchise expansion and corporate consolidation
    And democratic conversions need different investment structures (patient capital, community investment)
    When democratic food service conversions prove financially viable
    Then impact investors and CDFIs develop franchise-to-democratic conversion financing products
    And community investment pools proliferate to support local conversions
    And financial sector recognizes democratic food service as sound investment
    And capital availability for conversions increases, accelerating sector transformation
    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates with financial institutions on democratic business lending

  Scenario: Franchise operator mental health and wellbeing improves across converted locations
    Given franchise operation causes severe stress from dual extraction and moral injury
    And operators suffer isolation, anxiety, and health problems from franchise burden
    When conversions liberate operators from extraction trap
    Then operator mental health improves measurably (reduced anxiety, better sleep, lower stress)
    And peer support network among converted operators provides community
    And health outcomes are documented showing franchise model's human cost
    And sector awareness grows about franchise operation's psychological toll
    And industry_sector_elohim documents wellbeing improvements advocating for conversion support

  Scenario: Democratic food service becomes recognized industry sector category
    Given food service is categorized as: fast food chains, casual dining, fine dining, etc.
    And democratic ownership is not recognized as distinct sector category
    When democratic conversions reach critical mass and visibility
    Then "democratic food service" becomes recognized industry category
    And industry publications, conferences, and research treat it as distinct sector
    And consumers seek out democratic establishments, creating market demand
    And sector identity builds pride and coordination among democratic food service workers and operators
    And industry_sector_elohim advocates for democratic food service sector recognition and support
