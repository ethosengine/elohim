Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Teen
  As a teen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to participate actively in neighborhood-level care patterns
  So that I learn how communities function and contribute to collective neighborhood flourishing

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teen user "Jasmine" is registered in the system
    And Jasmine is 16 years old
    And she lives in the Riverside neighborhood
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates collective care patterns
    And Jasmine's personal_agent communicates with neighborhood_elohim

  Scenario: Teen participates in neighborhood care patterns as full member
    Given Jasmine's neighborhood has established care economy practices
    And she has accumulated care contributions across contexts
    When Jasmine engages neighborhood-level activities
    Then she should be recognized as a full participant, not a future member
    And her care contributions should aggregate with neighbors' contributions
    And she should have access to neighborhood collective resources
    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize her as a constitutional participant
    And her voice should matter in neighborhood decisions
    And she should experience being a valued member of her neighborhood community

  Scenario: Teen coordinates with neighbors for mutual benefit
    Given Jasmine's neighbor Mrs. Rodriguez is elderly and has limited mobility
    And Jasmine regularly does grocery shopping
    When Jasmine offers to shop for Mrs. Rodriguez
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate the coordination
    And track Jasmine's care contribution to neighborhood care economy
    And enable Mrs. Rodriguez to reciprocate through care tokens or other care
    And build neighborhood bonds through visible care exchange
    And demonstrate that care economy operates across age groups
    And recognize that Jasmine's care work has real value to neighborhood wellbeing

  Scenario: Neighborhood food access improved by teen participation
    Given Jasmine has knowledge of good deals and food sources
    And she is mobile and has time flexibility
    When she shares food access information through neighborhood networks
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should aggregate and distribute her knowledge
    And other neighbors should benefit from her market research
    And her contributions to collective food literacy should be recognized
    And neighborhood food security should improve through shared intelligence
    And Jasmine should learn that her knowledge is valuable to the community
    And information sharing should be recognized as care contribution

  Scenario: Teen builds peer networks for collective care economy
    Given Jasmine has friends and peers in the neighborhood
    And they are all learning care economy practices
    When Jasmine coordinates with peers for mutual support
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate peer-to-peer care
    And teens should be able to exchange care tokens without adult mediation
    And peer networks should operate horizontally as valid care economy
    And collective buying, skill sharing, and mutual aid should be supported
    And Jasmine should learn that care economy works at her generation's scale
    And peer care networks should build social capital and community resilience

  Scenario: Teen participates in neighborhood safety and social cohesion
    Given Jasmine is present in the neighborhood frequently
    And neighborhood safety depends on collective awareness
    When Jasmine contributes to neighborhood social cohesion
    Then her participation in neighborhood events should be tracked
    And her relationships with neighbors across age groups should be valued
    And her presence and engagement should contribute to perceived safety
    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize social capital building as care work
    And Jasmine should understand that community safety is collective care labor
    And her generation should be seen as contributors to neighborhood wellbeing, not problems to manage

  Scenario: Neighborhood collective resources accessible to teen based on contribution
    Given the neighborhood has established collective resources
    And Jasmine has accumulated substantial care contributions
    When she needs to access neighborhood resources
    Then her care contributions should give her standing to access shared resources
    And she should be able to use neighborhood tool library, shared equipment, or collective resources
    And access should be based on demonstrated participation, not age
    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize her as a contributor with legitimate access
    And she should learn that care economy operates on reciprocity, not charity
    And her care tokens should be valid currency in neighborhood exchanges

  Scenario: Teen voice included in neighborhood decision-making
    Given the neighborhood is making decisions about shared spaces
    And Jasmine uses neighborhood facilities and public spaces
    When neighborhood_elohim facilitates decision processes
    Then Jasmine's input should be solicited and valued
    And youth voice should be recognized as legitimate in neighborhood governance
    And her care contributions should give her standing in community decisions
    And she should not be dismissed due to age
    And the neighborhood should model inclusive governance that values all members
    And Jasmine should learn that she has legitimate voice in shaping her community

  Scenario: Teen identifies neighborhood needs and initiates responses
    Given Jasmine notices the neighborhood lacks safe spaces for younger children
    And she has capacity and interest to address this need
    When she proposes organizing a neighborhood play supervision rotation
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should support her initiative
    And facilitate coordination with other neighbors
    And recognize her leadership and care contribution
    And provide tools for organizing collective action
    And demonstrate that teens can initiate community improvements
    And build her capability for civic leadership and community organizing

  Scenario: Neighborhood bulk buying coordinated with teen participation
    Given Jasmine's neighborhood organizes collective bulk food purchases
    And she has transportation and time flexibility
    When she participates in bulk buying coordination
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate logistics
    And track her contributions of labor (pickup, distribution, coordination)
    And enable cost savings to be distributed equitably
    And recognize that her participation makes bulk buying possible for others
    And demonstrate that care economy creates real economic value
    And show that youth participation strengthens neighborhood economic resilience

  Scenario: Teen learns neighborhood governance through participation
    Given Jasmine is preparing for adult civic engagement
    And neighborhood is a foundational governance layer
    When she participates in neighborhood care economy
    Then she should learn how neighborhoods function as governance units
    And understand how collective decisions are made
    And practice participating in community conversations
    And build relationships with neighbors across differences
    And develop civic skills that will serve her adult life
    And internalize that communities require active participation to flourish

  Scenario: Neighborhood care patterns prevent teen isolation
    Given Jasmine could experience typical teen social isolation
    And care economy creates connection across age groups
    When she participates in neighborhood care patterns
    Then she should build relationships with neighbors beyond her peer group
    And experience being known and valued by her community
    And have access to support beyond her immediate family
    And develop sense of belonging to neighborhood community
    And learn that care economy builds social fabric
    And experience reduced isolation through meaningful community connection

  Scenario: Teen contributes to neighborhood ecological stewardship
    Given Jasmine's neighborhood has collective garden spaces
    And environmental stewardship is part of neighborhood care economy
    When Jasmine contributes to neighborhood composting or garden maintenance
    Then her ecological care work should be tracked and valued
    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize environmental labor
    And she should learn that care extends to land and ecological systems
    And neighborhood food production should be understood as collective care work
    And her generation should develop expectation that communities steward their environment
    And ecological care should be integrated with social and economic care
