Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Adult
  As an adult managing a household
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want equitable care labor distribution and resource coordination
  So that household flourishing is built on visible, valued contributions from all members

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the adult user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah shares a household with her partner
    And they have children Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim is coordinating household care economy
    And household income is $65k/year combined

  Scenario: Making both partners' care contributions visible
    Given Sarah performs meal planning, shopping, cooking, child coordination
    And her partner performs other household labor
    And much of this work is invisible in traditional economics
    When the household_elohim tracks contributions
    Then both partners' care work should be quantified specifically
    And invisible labor imbalances should become visible
    And Sarah and partner should see who's doing what
    And data should replace resentment in household discussions
    And visibility should enable fair distribution negotiations

  Scenario: Household resource allocation based on visible contributions
    Given Sarah and partner make joint financial decisions
    And both contribute care labor to household
    When household resources are allocated
    Then the household_elohim should present both partners' contributions
    And care labor should be valued alongside paid employment
    And Sarah's unpaid care work should carry equal weight to partner's income
    And resource decisions should reflect all contributions, not just money
    And household economics should recognize care creates value

  Scenario: Preventing invisible labor imbalances that damage relationships
    Given household labor often falls unfairly on women
    And invisible imbalances breed resentment
    When the household_elohim monitors labor distribution
    Then it should identify unfair distributions early
    And it should surface imbalances before they cause conflict
    And both partners should receive prompts about equity
    And adjustments should be negotiated from data, not resentment
    And the protocol should protect relationship health through fairness

  Scenario: Coordinating complex household schedules across family members
    Given Sarah manages her work schedule, children's schools, household tasks, appointments
    And partner has separate work schedule and obligations
    When household activities need coordination
    Then the household_elohim should integrate all family calendars
    And it should identify conflicts across household members
    And it should suggest solutions that work for everyone
    And schedule coordination should reduce stress, not increase it
    And household operations should run smoothly through effective coordination

  Scenario: Household budget management with care economy principles
    Given household operates on $65k/year budget
    And resources must cover housing, food, children's needs, healthcare, saving
    When Sarah makes purchasing decisions
    Then the household_elohim should track spending against budget
    And it should integrate financial constraints with family needs
    And it should help Sarah and partner make informed trade-offs
    And budget should reflect care priorities, not just consumption
    And financial management should serve household flourishing

  Scenario: Equitable labor distribution negotiated with care economy data
    Given Sarah feels she's doing more than her fair share
    And her partner may not see the full scope of her labor
    When they discuss household labor distribution
    Then the household_elohim should provide specific contribution data
    And Sarah's invisible labor should be quantified explicitly
    And both partners should see objective assessment
    And negotiations should be based on facts, not perceptions
    And equitable arrangements should be reachable through visibility

  Scenario: Household care tokens reflect combined family contributions
    Given household participates in care token economy
    And both adults and children contribute care labor
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then tokens should accumulate from all members' contributions
    And Sarah's care work should be valued appropriately
    And partner's contributions should be recognized
    And children's age-appropriate care work should count
    And household should receive care token supplements for income level
    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status

  Scenario: Household governance includes children at appropriate developmental levels
    Given Tommy (5) and Emma (8) are household members
    And they contribute care labor at age-appropriate levels
    When household decisions are made
    Then children should have voice appropriate to their development
    And Emma should have more input than Tommy
    And both should experience participating in household governance
    And the household_elohim should coordinate different permission levels
    And family democracy should be practiced, not just taught

  Scenario: Household boundaries coordinate with individual autonomy
    Given Sarah has individual autonomy over her choices
    And she also participates in household governance
    When Sarah makes decisions affecting the household
    Then household boundaries should be negotiated, not imposed
    And Sarah should maintain individual agency within household context
    And household_elohim should balance individual and collective needs
    And neither Sarah nor partner should dominate household governance
    And equitable partnership should be structurally supported

  Scenario: Household privacy protected from external surveillance
    Given household care economy generates detailed family data
    And this data reveals intimate household patterns
    When household data is collected
    Then it must remain under household members' control
    And no external entities should access household data without consent
    And workplace should never see household care patterns
    And community should only see what household chooses to share
    And household privacy should be absolutely protected

  Scenario: Household food security supported through care token supplements
    Given household income is $65k/year
    And food costs are rising
    When household's economic status qualifies for support
    Then care token supplements should be available
    And the Value Scanner should remain accessible
    And household should not face food insecurity
    And care economy should function as economic support system
    And access should be dignified, not stigmatizing

  Scenario: Household coordination during crisis maintains stability
    Given household faces crisis—job loss, illness, emergency
    And normal operations are disrupted
    When the household_elohim detects crisis conditions
    Then it should shift to crisis support mode
    And it should help household prioritize essential functions
    And it should connect household to emergency resources
    And it should maintain household stability under stress
    And the protocol should serve as household safety net
