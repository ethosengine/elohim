Feature: Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Adult
  As an adult worker with care responsibilities
  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer
  I want workplace policies to recognize workers' care economy participation
  So that employment supports rather than undermines household and community care

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the adult user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah works full-time as a teacher
    And Sarah has care responsibilities for children and aging parents
    And the workplace/organizational governance context is active
    And the workplace_elohim coordinates work-care integration
    And Sarah's employer participates in care economy recognition

  Scenario: Workplace recognizes employees' care responsibilities
    Given Sarah balances full-time teaching with intensive parenting
    And her care responsibilities affect her work capacity
    When workplace policies are designed
    Then the workplace_elohim should make employees' care work visible
    And Sarah's care responsibilities should be recognized, not ignored
    And workplace should acknowledge that workers have lives beyond employment
    And policies should support work-care integration, not create conflict
    And care economy should inform workplace culture

  Scenario: Flexible scheduling accommodates care economy participation
    Given Sarah needs to manage children's schedules, parent appointments, household tasks
    And rigid work schedules create impossible conflicts
    When Sarah's work schedule is determined
    Then the workplace_elohim should coordinate with personal_agent
    And flexible scheduling should accommodate care responsibilities
    And Sarah should be able to handle family emergencies without job risk
    And workplace should enable sustainable work-care balance
    And flexibility should be policy, not personal favor

  Scenario: Fair compensation reflects that care work requires time and energy
    Given Sarah's care responsibilities are substantial
    And she needs sufficient income to support household
    When Sarah's compensation is determined
    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for living wages
    And compensation should enable household flourishing, not just survival
    And Sarah should earn enough to afford care work time
    And wages should reflect that workers have care responsibilities
    And fair compensation should support care economy participation

  Scenario: Family leave policies support care during critical periods
    Given Sarah may need time for childbirth, child illness, parent care, family emergencies
    And traditional leave policies are inadequate
    When family care needs arise
    Then workplace should provide adequate paid family leave
    And leave should not require Sarah to sacrifice career advancement
    And the workplace_elohim should coordinate leave with care needs
    And family leave should be dignified and sufficient
    And policies should recognize care emergencies are inevitable

  Scenario: Workplace boundaries protect capacity for household care
    Given Sarah's care responsibilities require substantial time and energy
    And work can expand to consume all available capacity
    When workplace demands are placed on Sarah
    Then the workplace_elohim should monitor total demands
    And it should alert Sarah when work threatens care capacity
    And it should help her maintain boundaries
    And workplace should respect that Sarah has legitimate care obligations
    And boundaries should protect Sarah's sustainability

  Scenario: Care economy data supports worker advocacy for policy changes
    Given Sarah and colleagues want better workplace care policies
    And employers may not understand workers' care burdens
    When Sarah advocates for workplace policy changes
    Then the workplace_elohim should provide aggregated care economy data
    And advocacy should be strengthened by quantified evidence
    And Sarah should show that care responsibilities are substantial
    And policy discussions should be informed by actual care patterns
    And workers should use care economy data to win policy improvements

  Scenario: Preventing work-care conflict that causes burnout
    Given Sarah faces constant conflict between work and care demands
    And this conflict drives burnout in working parents
    When the workplace_elohim monitors Sarah's situation
    Then it should detect when work-care conflicts are unsustainable
    And it should alert Sarah before burnout occurs
    And it should suggest interventions (boundaries, policy advocacy, job changes)
    And it should help Sarah maintain long-term career sustainability
    And burnout prevention should be proactive, not reactive

  Scenario: Professional care work valued in care economy framework
    Given Sarah's teaching is professional care work
    And care economy should recognize professional caregiving
    When Sarah's care contributions are tracked
    Then her professional teaching should count as care labor
    And it should be valued alongside household care
    And Sarah should see her career as care economy participation
    And professional care workers should be recognized explicitly
    And care economy should include paid care work, not just unpaid

  Scenario: Workplace culture shift from extraction to care economy principles
    Given Sarah's workplace could adopt care economy principles
    And organizational culture shapes employee well-being
    When Sarah advocates for cultural change
    Then the workplace_elohim should support care economy adoption
    And workplace culture should value employee well-being
    And success should be measured by care, not just extraction
    And organizational culture should recognize care creates value
    And Sarah's workplace should demonstrate care economy in employment

  Scenario: Workplace privacy protects care economy data from employer access
    Given Sarah participates in care economy
    And this generates data about her personal life
    When workplace wants information about employees
    Then Sarah's personal care economy data must be completely private
    And employers should never access household care patterns
    And the workplace_elohim should only see work-relevant information
    And Sarah's privacy should be absolute in personal care matters
    And workplace participation should not require personal data sacrifice

  Scenario: Workplace care economy network provides peer support
    Given Sarah and colleagues all balance work with care responsibilities
    And peer support improves well-being and effectiveness
    When workplace adopts care economy principles
    Then the workplace_elohim should facilitate peer support networks
    And workers should share care economy strategies
    And Sarah should connect with others managing similar challenges
    And workplace community should strengthen through care economy
    And collective support should reduce individual burden

  Scenario: Part-time and flexible work options support intensive care periods
    Given Sarah may need reduced hours during intensive care periods
    And full-time work may be unsustainable at some life stages
    When Sarah's care responsibilities increase
    Then workplace should offer part-time and flexible work options
    And reduced hours should not mean career penalty
    And the workplace_elohim should coordinate schedule adjustments
    And Sarah should be able to modulate work commitment based on care needs
    And career paths should accommodate care economy participation

  Scenario: Workplace advocacy connects to broader care economy transformation
    Given Sarah's workplace advocacy could influence other employers
    And workplace policy changes could spread
    When Sarah's workplace successfully implements care economy policies
    Then the workplace_elohim should share success with other organizations
    And effective policies should be documented and promoted
    And Sarah's advocacy should contribute to broader transformation
    And workplace care economy should grow from successful examples
    And employment should shift toward care economy principles at scale
