Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Parent
  As a parent needing community support beyond nuclear family
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want connection to local parent networks and resource sharing
  So that parenting is collective support, not isolated struggle

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah lives in a specific neighborhood
    And other parents in the neighborhood also use the Value Scanner
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy
    And Sarah is learning that parenting doesn't have to be isolated

  Scenario: Discovering compatible parents in neighborhood
    Given Sarah needs connection to other parents
    And compatible values and needs matter for effective support
    When the neighborhood_elohim analyzes parent compatibility
    Then it should identify parents with similar-aged children
    And it should match based on compatible care values
    And it should connect parents who could provide mutual support
    And Sarah should be introduced to potential parent network
    And the system should break down isolation
    And neighborhood parent community should be facilitated

  Scenario: Coordinating neighborhood childcare exchange
    Given Sarah needs occasional childcare coverage
    And she can provide childcare for others in exchange
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates childcare sharing
    Then it should match parents for reciprocal childcare
    And it should track care provided and received
    And it should ensure exchanges are equitable over time
    And childcare cooperation should be visible and valued
    And parents should support each other sustainably
    And neighborhood care economy should reduce childcare costs

  Scenario: Bulk buying coordination with neighborhood families
    Given multiple families buy similar groceries and supplies
    And bulk purchasing reduces costs
    When Sarah participates in neighborhood bulk buying
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate group purchases
    And it should manage logistics of ordering and distribution
    And it should track cost savings for participating families
    And care tokens should reflect coordination labor
    And neighborhood cooperation should create economic benefit
    And the system should enable collective resource efficiency

  Scenario: Neighborhood resource library for children's items
    Given children outgrow clothing, toys, and equipment rapidly
    And buying everything new is expensive and wasteful
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates resource sharing
    Then it should enable lending libraries for children's items
    And it should track who has what available to share
    And it should facilitate borrowing rather than buying
    And resource sharing should be recognized as care contribution
    And neighborhood sustainability should reduce family expenses
    And the system should enable circular economy for child-rearing

  Scenario: Neighborhood parent skill and knowledge sharing
    Given different parents have different expertise
    And Sarah has teaching skills while others have different capabilities
    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates knowledge exchange
    Then it should connect parents for skill sharing
    And Sarah could teach value literacy while learning car repair
    And knowledge exchange should be tracked and valued
    And diverse parent expertise should strengthen whole community
    And neighborhood care economy should be knowledge-rich
    And the system should enable parent-to-parent education

  Scenario: Neighborhood safety and child supervision cooperation
    Given parents worry about children's neighborhood safety
    And collective supervision is more effective than isolation
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates safety cooperation
    Then it should enable coordinated supervision of playing children
    And it should help parents watch out for all neighborhood kids
    And collective care should be recognized and valued
    And neighborhood should become safer through cooperation
    And children should have freedom within community care
    And the system should enable collective responsibility for children

  Scenario: Neighborhood emotional support and parent mental health
    Given parenting is emotionally intense and often isolating
    And Sarah needs connection to parents who understand
    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates parent support
    Then it should enable parent peer support groups
    And it should provide spaces for parents to share struggles
    And emotional support should be recognized as care labor
    And receiving support should not be stigmatized
    And parent mental health should be community priority
    And the system should reduce parenting isolation

  Scenario: Neighborhood care during family crisis
    Given families sometimes face crisis (illness, job loss, emergency)
    And neighbors can provide crucial support during crisis
    When a neighborhood family faces crisis
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate mutual aid
    And it should identify who has capacity to help
    And it should organize meal trains, childcare, practical support
    And crisis care should be specially recognized and valued
    And neighborhood resilience should be built through mutual aid
    And the system should enable rapid community response

  Scenario: Neighborhood advocacy for family-friendly infrastructure
    Given neighborhoods need playgrounds, safe streets, family resources
    And collective advocacy is more effective than individual effort
    When the neighborhood_elohim supports collective action
    Then it should coordinate parent advocacy for family needs
    And it should enable organizing for better infrastructure
    And advocacy labor should be recognized as care work
    And Sarah's organizing should accumulate care tokens
    And neighborhood improvement should be collective effort
    And the system should amplify parent political power

  Scenario: Neighborhood cultural diversity in parenting approaches
    Given the neighborhood includes families from diverse cultures
    And different cultures have different parenting practices
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates across cultural differences
    Then it should respect diverse parenting approaches
    And it should facilitate cross-cultural learning
    And it should prevent cultural imperialism in parenting norms
    And diverse practices should be valued, not homogenized
    And neighborhood care economy should be culturally inclusive
    And the system should support multicultural community

  Scenario: Neighborhood connection across economic differences
    Given the neighborhood includes families at different income levels
    And economic inequality can divide communities
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates care economy
    Then it should enable connection across economic differences
    And care tokens should provide support to lower-income families
    And resource sharing should reduce economic barriers
    And neighborhood cooperation should reduce inequality impacts
    And mixed-income community should be strengthened
    And the system should build solidarity, not division

  Scenario: Neighborhood outdoor spaces and environmental care
    Given children need access to nature and outdoor play
    And Sarah wants to teach environmental stewardship
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates environmental care
    Then it should organize neighborhood green space maintenance
    And it should coordinate children's environmental education
    And it should track ecological care labor
    And Sarah's environmental teaching should be recognized
    And neighborhood sustainability should be collective project
    And the system should connect child-rearing to ecological health
