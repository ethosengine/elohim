# Refugee - Social Medium

## Archetype

A refugee is someone who has fled their country due to persecution, war, or violence and has been granted international protection. In the Social Medium context, refugees need to maintain connections with family and culture left behind, build new community connections in their host country, navigate complex legal and resettlement systems, and preserve cultural identity across displacement. The system must work across borders, support multiple languages, and protect vulnerable people from exploitation.
