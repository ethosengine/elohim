Feature: Educational Participation for Child
  As a child in the social_medium system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to participate in learning communities safely
  So that I can grow intellectually while protected and supported

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the child user is registered in the system
    And the educational governance context is active
    And Emma, age 10, is enrolled in Riverside Elementary

  Scenario: Child joins school homework help space
    Given Emma's school has a homework help space on the Elohim network
    And the space is moderated by teachers and parent volunteers
    When Emma joins the space through her school connection
    Then she gains access to homework help from peers and mentors
    And all participants are verified members of the school community
    And the moderation agent maintains supportive atmosphere
    And predatory behavior is structurally impossible
    And Emma can ask questions and help classmates

  Scenario: Child contributes to science fair project collaboration
    Given Emma is working on a science fair project about local ecology
    And several classmates are working on related projects
    When Emma creates a contribution about discovering salamanders in the creek
    And she shares photos and observations with classmates
    Then the contribution reaches her project team immediately
    And her teacher can provide feedback and guidance
    And the learning agent surfaces related educational resources
    And Emma learns collaborative research skills
    And the project documentation is preserved for science fair presentation

  Scenario: Child protected from cyberbullying attempt
    Given Emma participates in school reading club space
    When another student tries to post mean comments about Emma
    Then the guardian agent detects harmful intent before posting
    And the comment is prevented from reaching Emma
    And the space moderator is alerted to address the behavior
    And the student who posted receives appropriate intervention
    And Emma continues participating without being harmed
    And restorative process helps both students learn and grow

  Scenario: Child earns district reach through exceptional science project
    Given Emma's ecology project demonstrates unusual depth and quality
    And her teacher nominates it for district-wide educational showcase
    When the nomination is evaluated by educational moderators
    Then Emma's project is featured in district educational space
    And other students across the district can learn from her work
    And Emma experiences recognition for quality contribution
    And she connects with other young scientists in the district
    And this exceptional contribution earns her expanded educational reach
