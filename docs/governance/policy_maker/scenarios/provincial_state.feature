Feature: Provincial/State Governance for Policy Maker
  As a policy_maker in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer
  I want to create enabling legislation for democratic AI governance
  So that communities can flourish with protocol while resisting corporate capture

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational in multiple communities
    And Senator Elena Ruiz chairs the State Senate AI Governance Committee
    And the provincial_state governance context is active
    And Elena has been observing protocol adoption across the state for 3 years

  Scenario: Draft enabling legislation for community protocol adoption
    Given Riverside and other communities want to adopt Elohim Protocol
    And they need legal framework and public funding support
    When Elena crafts the Community AI Infrastructure Act
    Then she includes funding for community nodes and infrastructure
    And she establishes legal recognition of Constitutional Council precedents
    And she ensures poor communities have equitable access
    And she protects local sovereignty from state overreach
    And she consults with Mayor Jamal Washington on implementation needs
    And the legislation enables rather than controls protocol adoption

  Scenario: Defend protocol against corporate capture attempt
    Given technology companies lobby for mandatory backdoor access
    And lobbyists claim backdoors are needed for "safety and accountability"
    When Elena receives the lobbying pressure
    Then she consults technical expert Amara Okonkwo about feasibility
    And Amara explains backdoors break constitutional verification cryptographically
    And Elena brings testimony from Riverside showing democratic oversight works
    And Elena exposes that "safety" rhetoric masks corporate control interests
    And Elena publicly discloses all lobbying contacts and funding sources
    And Elena defeats the backdoor mandate protecting protocol sovereignty

  Scenario: Establish legal recognition of agent decisions in state courts
    Given state courts are uncertain how to treat Constitutional Council precedents
    And some judges dismiss agent reasoning as inadmissible
    When Elena crafts Digital Constitutional Rights Amendment
    Then she establishes council precedents as binding in protocol-related cases
    And she requires courts to recognize agent constitutional reasoning
    And she clarifies evidentiary standards for agent testimony
    And she ensures due process protections remain intact
    And she works with judicial branch to train judges on protocol
    And courts can integrate protocol with legal system

  Scenario: Secure state funding for poor communities excluded by cost
    Given communities like Riverside lack resources for protocol infrastructure
    And democratic governance tools should be universal not luxury goods
    When Elena includes funding in state budget
    Then she allocates grants for community protocol adoption
    And she establishes sliding scale fees based on community wealth
    And she creates cross-subsidization from wealthy to poor communities
    And she justifies spending as democracy infrastructure investment
    And Elena ensures no community is excluded due to cost barriers

  Scenario: Learn from Constitutional Council precedents to inform legislation
    Given state Constitutional Council established precedent on privacy thresholds
    And the council balanced care and dignity in mental health intervention cases
    When Elena drafts Digital Dignity Protection statute
    Then she translates constitutional principle into statutory language
    And she references specific council precedents in legislative findings
    And she ensures statute aligns with constitutional interpretation
    And she respects that councils interpret constitution, she implements through policy
    And sortition democracy and representative democracy work as complementary systems

  Scenario: Coordinate with community leaders on implementation challenges
    Given Mayor Jamal reports tension between protocol and state regulations
    And state environmental law conflicts with ecosystem agent decisions
    When Elena reviews the regulatory conflict
    Then she consults with community leaders about ground truth
    And she identifies where state regulation should defer to protocol
    And she identifies where state standards provide necessary minimums
    And she crafts legislation harmonizing state law with protocol
    And she preserves community sovereignty while maintaining state interests

  Scenario: Commission research on protocol effectiveness for evidence-based policy
    Given Elena needs data to justify continued support and defend against critics
    When she commissions Dr. James Chen to conduct evaluation study
    Then she provides public funding requiring open access publication
    And she requests rigorous methodology not promotional claims
    And she asks for both positive outcomes and failures
    And James delivers evidence showing reduced loneliness and improved wellbeing
    And Elena cites this research in committee hearings
    And evidence-based policy defeats ideological opposition

  Scenario: Address interstate coordination challenges
    Given protocol operates across state borders
    And neighboring states have different legal frameworks
    When Elena encounters coordination problems
    Then she proposes interstate compact recognizing protocol decisions
    And she coordinates with legislators in neighboring states
    And she establishes framework for cross-border agent coordination
    And she ensures citizens can move between states without losing continuity
    And she balances state sovereignty with need for harmonization

  Scenario: Integrate protocol with state social services
    Given state welfare, healthcare, and education systems need to coordinate with agents
    When Elena crafts integration legislation
    Then she requires state agencies to interoperate with protocol
    And she allows welfare benefits to flow through ValueFlow accounting
    And she recognizes care tokens in economic support calculations
    And she establishes coordination protocols not subordination
    And she treats agents as peer partners with state agencies

  Scenario: Defend against authoritarian legislative proposals
    Given opposition legislators propose mandatory surveillance for "public safety"
    And proposal would compromise agent privacy protections
    When Elena fights the surveillance mandate
    Then she brings testimony from communities about surveillance harm
    And she shows constitutional councils already provide accountability
    And she exposes authoritarian implications of the proposal
    And she builds coalition with civil liberties organizations
    And she defeats the proposal protecting privacy rights
    And democratic governance resists authoritarian capture

  Scenario: Navigate electoral accountability while supporting long-term protocol development
    Given Elena faces reelection campaign
    And protocol is delivering results in communities like Riverside
    When she campaigns on her protocol support
    Then she presents data on improved community wellbeing
    And she shares testimony from Mayor Jamal and residents
    And she demonstrates protocol solves problems traditional governance struggled with
    And she wins reelection with mandate to continue protocol support
    And electoral accountability rewards effective democratic innovation
