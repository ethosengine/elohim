Feature: Global Governance for Policy Maker
  As a policy_maker in the governance system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want to protect protocol sovereignty in international governance
  So that democratic AI governance resists corporate and authoritarian capture globally

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational in dozens of countries
    And Senator Elena Ruiz participates in international AI governance forums
    And the global governance context addresses cross-border coordination
    And Elena champions democratic alternative to corporate and authoritarian AI models

  Scenario: Advocate for protocol sovereignty in international treaty negotiations
    Given international trade negotiations include AI governance provisions
    And some nations propose centralizing AI regulation
    When Elena represents US position in treaty talks
    Then she advocates for protocol sovereignty as democratic principle
    And she argues against mandating centralization that enables capture
    And she proposes framework allowing diverse governance models
    And she insists on interoperability without homogenization
    And she builds coalition with democratic nations supporting protocol
    And treaty preserves space for community-governed AI

  Scenario: Resist regulatory arbitrage by multinational corporations
    Given corporations seek most permissive jurisdiction for AI governance
    And race-to-the-bottom dynamics threaten democratic oversight
    When Elena coordinates with international counterparts
    Then she proposes international standards for democratic AI governance
    And she establishes constitutional minimums all signatories must meet
    And she prevents corporations from evading oversight through jurisdiction shopping
    And she creates enforcement mechanisms for treaty compliance
    And she protects protocol from corporate regulatory arbitrage

  Scenario: Learn from global Constitutional Convention to inform US policy
    Given First Global Constitutional Convention passes Ecological Standing Amendment
    And 10,000 citizens from around world voted to give ecosystems legal personhood
    When Elena observes the convention proceedings
    Then she watches global democratic deliberation at unprecedented scale
    And she learns from citizens' constitutional reasoning
    And she translates ecological standing into US federal legislation
    And she operationalizes constitutional principles in statutory form
    And she demonstrates how global sortition informs national representative democracy

  Scenario: Build international coalition resisting authoritarian AI governance
    Given authoritarian governments propose surveillance-based AI control
    And they argue this model provides "stability and efficiency"
    When Elena participates in international AI governance summit
    Then she exposes harms of authoritarian surveillance model
    And she presents evidence that democratic protocol governance works
    And she brings testimony from Constitutional Council members
    And she shows protocol achieves accountability without oppression
    And she builds coalition of democratic nations rejecting authoritarian approach
    And democratic AI governance model gains international legitimacy

  Scenario: Address climate crisis coordination requiring global agent coordination
    Given climate change requires coordination beyond national boundaries
    And Ecosystem Elohim agents need to work across borders
    When Elena participates in international climate governance
    Then she proposes framework for cross-border ecosystem agent coordination
    And she establishes protocols for transboundary watershed management
    And she ensures climate coordination respects national sovereignty
    And she creates mechanisms for resolving cross-border conflicts
    And she demonstrates protocol can address existential global challenges

  Scenario: Protect protocol from international corporate lobbying
    Given multinational corporations lobby international organizations
    And corporations push for "harmonized regulation" that serves their interests
    When Elena engages with World Trade Organization and UN
    Then she exposes corporate capture attempts publicly
    And she mobilizes grassroots opposition from protocol communities worldwide
    And she brings Mayor Jamal and other community leaders to international forums
    And she demonstrates that communities oppose corporate governance model
    And she defeats regulatory capture at international scale

  Scenario: Establish international research collaboration on protocol governance
    Given protocol operates in diverse cultural and political contexts
    When Elena secures funding for global research consortium
    Then researcher Dr. James Chen leads international comparative study
    And researchers from multiple countries evaluate protocol outcomes
    And research examines whether democratic AI governance is culturally universal
    And findings are published open access in multiple languages
    And evidence informs international policy debates
    And rigorous research strengthens case for democratic governance model

  Scenario: Navigate tension between national sovereignty and global coordination
    Given nations want autonomy in AI governance
    And global coordination is needed for cross-border challenges
    When Elena proposes international framework
    Then she applies principle of subsidiarity at global scale
    And she establishes only constitutional minimums not comprehensive rules
    And she preserves national, state, and community sovereignty
    And she enables coordination without centralization
    And she demonstrates federalism can work globally

  Scenario: Respond to global AI catastrophe risk requiring international cooperation
    Given early warning system detects existential AI risk
    And international coordination is needed within days
    When Elena participates in emergency international response
    Then she coordinates with other nations on protocol modifications
    And she ensures democratic legitimacy is maintained despite urgency
    And she brings Constitutional Council emergency session results to international forum
    And she demonstrates democratic governance can respond to existential threats
    And she prevents crisis from being exploited for authoritarian power grabs

  Scenario: Advocate for universal human dignity as global constitutional minimum
    Given different nations have different governance priorities
    And cultural relativism creates tension with universal rights
    When Elena participates in international human rights discussions
    Then she advocates for dignity as non-negotiable constitutional minimum
    And she argues protocol provides framework balancing universal and local
    And she shows how diverse cultures can share core principles
    And she builds consensus around constitutional minimums
    And she establishes that democratic AI governance serves human flourishing globally

  Scenario: Position US as leader in democratic AI governance internationally
    Given US has successfully implemented protocol at scale
    And other nations are considering adoption
    When Elena represents US at international summits
    Then she shares evidence of protocol effectiveness
    And she offers technical assistance to nations considering adoption
    And she positions democratic governance as alternative to Chinese surveillance model
    And she builds US soft power through governance innovation
    And she demonstrates democratic values can lead in AI governance
    And protocol becomes international model for democratic superintelligence governance
