Feature: National Governance for Policy Maker
  As a policy_maker in the governance system
  Operating at the nation_state governance layer
  I want to establish federal framework enabling democratic AI governance
  So that protocol can serve all citizens while resisting corporate and authoritarian capture

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational across multiple states
    And Senator Elena Ruiz now chairs Senate Committee on AI and Digital Governance
    And the nation_state governance context is active
    And Elena has championed protocol at state level and is scaling to federal policy

  Scenario: Craft federal funding program for equitable protocol access
    Given poor communities and rural areas lack resources for adoption
    And democratic governance tools must be universal not restricted by wealth
    When Elena drafts National AI Infrastructure Act
    Then she establishes federal grants for community protocol adoption
    And she prioritizes funding for marginalized and under-resourced communities
    And she treats protocol infrastructure like roads or electricity
    And she includes research funding for rigorous outcome evaluation
    And she ensures state sovereignty is preserved despite federal funding
    And the legislation passes with bipartisan support

  Scenario: Defend protocol against corporate lobbying for regulatory capture
    Given technology companies lobby Congress for favorable regulation
    And lobbyists propose licensing requirements that create barriers to entry
    When Elena testifies in committee hearing
    Then she presents evidence from Riverside about protocol effectiveness
    And she brings Mayor Jamal Washington to share community testimony
    And she shows Constitutional Council precedents demonstrate democratic oversight
    And she exposes how proposed regulation advantages corporate incumbents
    And she argues for protocol sovereignty as democratic principle
    And the capture attempt is defeated

  Scenario: Translate Constitutional Council precedent into federal legislation
    Given national Constitutional Council established privacy threshold precedent
    And the precedent balanced mental health intervention with dignity rights
    When Elena drafts Federal Digital Dignity Act
    Then she translates constitutional principle into statutory language
    And she references Constitutional Council reasoning in legislative findings
    And she ensures federal law aligns with council interpretation
    And she establishes that courts must recognize council precedents
    And she operationalizes constitutional principles in federal government

  Scenario: Establish interstate coordination framework
    Given protocol operates seamlessly across state lines
    And states have different legal frameworks creating coordination challenges
    When Elena proposes Interstate AI Governance Compact
    Then she establishes framework for recognizing protocol decisions across states
    And she creates coordination mechanisms without federal overreach
    And she preserves state and community sovereignty
    And she enables citizens to move between states without losing continuity
    And she balances federalism with need for national coherence

  Scenario: Resist federal surveillance mandate that would compromise protocol
    Given national security officials propose mandatory backdoor access
    And proposal claims need for law enforcement and counterterrorism
    When Elena leads opposition to the mandate
    Then she brings technical expert Amara Okonkwo to explain cryptographic impossibility
    And Amara testifies that backdoors break constitutional verification
    And Elena shows surveillance would enable authoritarian abuse
    And Elena demonstrates Constitutional Councils provide accountability without backdoors
    And Elena builds coalition with civil liberties and technology communities
    And the surveillance mandate is defeated protecting protocol integrity

  Scenario: Commission national research on protocol outcomes
    Given Elena needs evidence to justify federal support and answer critics
    When she directs National Science Foundation funding to protocol research
    Then researcher Dr. James Chen receives grant for longitudinal study
    And Elena requires open access publication and methodological rigor
    And James evaluates effectiveness, equity, and long-term impacts
    And James finds reduced loneliness, improved crisis response, and high trust
    And Elena cites this research throughout legislative process
    And evidence-based policy defeats uninformed opposition

  Scenario: Integrate protocol with federal government systems
    Given federal agencies need to coordinate with protocol agents
    When Elena crafts Federal AI Coordination Act
    Then she requires federal agencies to interoperate with protocol
    And she establishes coordination as partnership not subordination
    And she addresses taxation implications of care tokens and ValueFlow
    And she clarifies how protocol relates to Social Security and Medicare
    And she ensures government-protocol integration serves citizens

  Scenario: Address tension between federal standards and local autonomy
    Given communities want sovereignty over protocol calibration
    And federal consistency is needed for interstate coordination
    When Elena establishes federal framework
    Then she explicitly preserves community and state authority
    And she sets only constitutional minimums not comprehensive rules
    And she articulates principle of subsidiarity in legislation
    And she consults widely with community leaders and councils
    And she balances national unity with local diversity

  Scenario: Respond to protocol crisis requiring rapid legislative action
    Given zero-day cryptographic vulnerability is discovered
    And protocol security is compromised requiring immediate response
    When Elena convenes emergency session
    Then she works with technical experts to understand the threat
    And she coordinates with Constitutional Councils on emergency protocols
    And she crafts emergency legislation authorizing temporary measures
    And she includes explicit sunset provisions preventing permanent power grab
    And she maintains democratic legitimacy despite urgency
    And democratic governance proves it can respond to existential threats

  Scenario: Defend democratic legitimacy of sortition governance
    Given congressional colleagues challenge Constitutional Council authority
    And critics argue randomly-selected citizens lack expertise and accountability
    When Elena explains sortition model in Senate floor speech
    Then she articulates how random selection prevents capture
    And she shows how stratified selection ensures demographic representation
    And she explains that short terms prevent professional political class
    And she demonstrates councils bring lived experience not policy expertise
    And she argues sortition complements rather than replaces representative democracy
    And she persuades skeptical colleagues of democratic legitimacy

  Scenario: Prepare constitutional amendment recognizing sortition governance
    Given federal constitution does not explicitly address sortition councils
    And formal recognition would strengthen democratic legitimacy
    When Elena drafts proposed constitutional amendment
    Then she establishes sortition governance as legitimate democratic form
    And she clarifies relationship to existing federal government structures
    And she preserves both representative and sortition democracy
    And she begins process of building support for amendment
    And she positions this as constitutional evolution not revolution
