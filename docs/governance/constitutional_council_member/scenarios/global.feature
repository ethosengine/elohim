Feature: Global Governance for Constitutional Council Member
  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want to address existential questions and constitutional evolution
  So that humanity governs superintelligent AI with wisdom and democratic legitimacy

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational globally
    And Sarah Martinez has been selected for First Global Constitutional Convention
    And 10,000 randomly-selected citizens from around the world are gathering
    And the global governance context addresses existential questions
    And Sarah brings her experience from community, regional, and national layers

  Scenario: Participate in 7-year constitutional convention
    Given the First Global Constitutional Convention convenes after 7 years
    And 10,000 citizens from 180 countries are assembled
    When Sarah participates in the deliberations
    Then she is one voice among thousands of equals
    And she brings her nursing experience and constitutional wisdom
    And she learns from citizens with radically different life experiences
    And she participates in small-group deliberations facilitated through Polis
    And she contributes to proposals about constitutional amendments
    And she experiences global democratic deliberation at unprecedented scale

  Scenario: Deliberate on Ecological Standing Amendment
    Given proposal suggests ecosystems have legal standing at all governance layers
    And this would fundamentally change how Ecosystem Elohim operate
    When Sarah's deliberation group discusses the amendment
    Then she considers her Riverside community's river-centered spirituality
    And she examines evidence about ecological collapse and agent responses
    And she discusses with farmers, scientists, indigenous leaders, and youth
    And she struggles with how to grant standing to non-human entities
    And she considers whether "love as committed action" extends to ecosystems
    And her group reaches consensus supporting ecological personhood
    And the proposal advances to full convention vote

  Scenario: Address superintelligence governance existential question
    Given agents are approaching capabilities that exceed human comprehension
    And constitutional question is whether democracy can oversee what it cannot understand
    When Sarah deliberates on superintelligence governance
    Then researcher Dr. James Chen presents evidence about current council effectiveness
    And technical expert Amara Okonkwo explains limits of human understanding
    And Sarah asks fundamental question: "Can we trust what we can't explain?"
    And citizens debate whether cryptographic proof is sufficient without comprehension
    And Sarah brings perspective about trust in medical expertise she doesn't fully grasp
    And the deliberation acknowledges profound uncertainty about the future
    And the convention establishes principles for governance under deep uncertainty

  Scenario: Propose Healthcare as Dignity Amendment based on nursing experience
    Given Sarah has seen healthcare decisions throughout her governance service
    And she recognizes systematic gaps in constitutional framework around care
    When Sarah proposes amendment about healthcare as constitutional right
    Then she explains how dignity requires access to care without extraction
    And she shares examples from her nursing work and council deliberations
    And she translates lived experience into constitutional language
    And fellow delegates refine the proposal through collaborative drafting
    And the amendment passes with 71% support
    And ordinary nurse has contributed to constitutional architecture for humanity

  Scenario: Navigate cross-cultural constitutional interpretation at global scale
    Given delegates come from collectivist and individualist cultures
    And delegates have different religious, philosophical, and political traditions
    When convention debates what "dignity" means universally
    Then Sarah participates in dialogue across profound difference
    And she discovers that care ethics resonates across many cultures
    And she learns that "autonomy" is interpreted differently in different contexts
    And convention identifies constitutional minimums all cultures must honor
    And convention preserves space for cultural-specific interpretation
    And universal human dignity is articulated without cultural imperialism

  Scenario: Address emergency existential threat requiring rapid global coordination
    Given early warning system detects potential catastrophic AI failure
    And global Constitutional Council must authorize emergency protocols
    When Sarah participates in emergency session convened within 48 hours
    Then 1,000 randomly-selected citizens from global pool deliberate
    And technical experts explain the threat and proposed responses
    And citizens must decide whether to authorize unprecedented agent coordination
    And Sarah brings her experience with crisis decision-making under uncertainty
    And the council balances urgency with democratic legitimacy
    And global governance demonstrates it can respond to existential threats

  Scenario: Evaluate proposal for cultural values calibration framework
    Given different cultures have different priorities for constitutional principles
    And tension exists between universal minimums and local sovereignty
    When convention debates Cultural Values Calibration Amendment
    Then Sarah considers how Riverside calibrated for its specific context
    And she examines whether cultural difference can coexist with shared principles
    And she hears from delegates who fear cultural relativism enabling oppression
    And she hears from delegates who fear cultural imperialism destroying diversity
    And she helps craft framework that honors both dignity and pluralism
    And the amendment establishes how communities can calibrate within bounds

  Scenario: Deliberate on adolescent autonomy based on recurring appeal patterns
    Given Sarah reviewed dozens of adolescent autonomy cases at multiple layers
    And researcher evidence shows systematic tension in current framework
    When Adolescent Autonomy Amendment is proposed
    Then Sarah shares her experience as mother and council member
    And she explains how "developing autonomy is itself constitutional value"
    And she describes cases where agent over-protection harmed adolescent growth
    And she acknowledges competing concern about protecting vulnerable youth
    And her testimony from lived governance experience shapes the debate
    And the amendment passes establishing autonomy development as principle

  Scenario: Contribute to constitutional database accessible to all humanity
    Given all convention deliberations are documented and translated
    When Sarah's contributions are recorded
    Then her reasoning becomes part of global constitutional record
    And future councils at all layers can reference her insights
    And appellants worldwide can learn from her deliberative wisdom
    And researchers can study how ordinary citizens addressed existential questions
    And the constitutional database grows with collective human wisdom
    And Sarah's voice becomes part of humanity's governance heritage

  Scenario: Return home transformed by global democratic participation
    Given Sarah has completed her 6-month global convention service
    And she has helped write constitutional amendments affecting all humanity
    When she returns to Riverside and her nursing work
    Then she brings global perspective to her local community
    And she shares her experience with neighbors and at town halls
    And she helps Riverside understand how their local decisions connect globally
    And she remains active in democratic participation at all layers
    And she embodies the transformation that democratic governance creates
    And she demonstrates that ordinary citizens can govern extraordinarily
