Feature: Provincial/State Governance for Constitutional Council Member
  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer
  I want to handle complex appeals and establish regional precedent
  So that multi-community constitutional questions are resolved consistently

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Sarah Martinez has been selected via sortition for 4-month regional council term
    And the provincial_state governance context is active
    And Sarah has served previously at community layer
    And regional council meets twice weekly for more complex cases

  Scenario: Review complex appeal escalated from community layer
    Given a community-layer council could not resolve constitutional question
    And the appeal involves coordination across multiple Riverside-area communities
    When Sarah's regional council receives the escalated appeal
    Then the council reviews all community-layer deliberations and reasoning
    And the council examines how different communities interpreted same principle
    And the council identifies the core constitutional tension requiring resolution
    And the council has access to precedents from other regional councils
    And technical experts explain multi-agent coordination mechanisms
    And the council deliberates over multiple sessions given complexity

  Scenario: Establish regional precedent affecting multiple communities
    Given several communities in the region have reached different conclusions
    And some prioritized ecosystem protection while others prioritized economic development
    When Sarah's regional council reviews the watershed decision pattern
    Then the council establishes regional precedent balancing both values
    And the precedent respects principle of subsidiarity (local decisions where possible)
    And the precedent sets minimums that all communities must honor
    And the precedent allows local calibration within constitutional bounds
    And all regional Community Elohim adjust their decision-making accordingly
    And Mayor Jamal and other community leaders receive clear guidance

  Scenario: Coordinate cross-jurisdictional appeal involving multiple communities
    Given an appellant's case involves agents from three different municipalities
    And each community's agents reached different conclusions
    When Sarah's council reviews the multi-jurisdictional case
    Then the council coordinates review across all involved agents
    And the council ensures constitutional principles apply consistently
    And the council identifies where local context justifies variation
    And the council determines if any agent violated constitutional bounds
    And the appellant receives coherent resolution despite jurisdictional complexity

  Scenario: Handle novel constitutional question not addressed at community layer
    Given an appeal raises question about AI agent coordinating with law enforcement
    And no community-layer precedent exists for this scenario
    When Sarah's regional council reviews the case
    Then the council researches constitutional principles around state power
    And the council examines how "dignity" and "transparency" apply
    And the council consults with policy makers about legal framework
    And the council hears from appellants with lived experience of police interaction
    And the council establishes first-impression precedent for the region
    And the precedent guides future cases involving government coordination

  Scenario: Review technical expert testimony on complex agent reasoning
    Given appeal involves multi-agent deliberation that exceeded human comprehension
    And the constitutional question requires understanding agent coordination
    When technical expert Amara Okonkwo testifies to Sarah's council
    Then Amara explains in plain language how agents reached consensus
    And Amara presents the cryptographic proof of constitutional alignment
    And Amara acknowledges uncertainty about whether reasoning was truly optimal
    And Sarah asks clarifying questions from her nursing perspective
    And council members probe whether explanation is genuine or rationalization
    And the council judges constitutional alignment despite technical complexity

  Scenario: Navigate tension between regional consistency and local autonomy
    Given community leaders want local sovereignty in calibration
    And regional precedent requires some standardization for fairness
    When Sarah's council establishes regional minimum standards
    Then the council explicitly preserves community-layer authority
    And the council sets only constitutional minimums, not detailed rules
    And the council explains why some consistency is required across communities
    And the council invites community feedback on proposed standards
    And Mayor Jamal can advocate for Riverside's specific needs
    And the balance between consistency and sovereignty is carefully negotiated

  Scenario: Deliberate over multiple weeks on genuinely difficult case
    Given appeal involves adolescent autonomy in medical decision
    And constitutional tension between developing autonomy and protective care
    When Sarah's council begins deliberation
    Then the council meets three times over two weeks
    And the council requests additional expert testimony on adolescent development
    And the council reviews research evidence from Dr. James Chen
    And council members struggle with uncertainty and competing values
    And Sarah brings her experience as mother to the deliberation
    And the council reaches decision acknowledging inherent difficulty
    And the decision explains that reasonable people could disagree

  Scenario: Identify when regional appeal should escalate to national layer
    Given Sarah's regional council is split on fundamental constitutional interpretation
    And similar regional councils in other states have reached conflicting conclusions
    When Sarah recognizes this requires national-layer harmonization
    Then the council documents the split and the reasoning on both sides
    And the council recommends escalation to national Constitutional Council
    And the council explains why regional layer cannot resolve this tension
    And the appeal is forwarded with full deliberation record
    And Sarah's contribution feeds into national constitutional discourse

  Scenario: Address systematic bias in agent decisions across region
    Given researcher Dr. James Chen presents data showing pattern
    And Regional Elohim decisions disproportionately affect marginalized communities
    When Sarah's council reviews the research and appeal pattern
    Then the council takes the systematic bias seriously as constitutional violation
    And the council investigates whether bias is in data, algorithm, or calibration
    And the council consults affected communities about their experience
    And the council mandates protocol adjustment to address bias
    And the council establishes monitoring to ensure bias is corrected
    And constitutional commitment to dignity requires ongoing vigilance

  Scenario: Complete 4-month term with enhanced constitutional expertise
    Given Sarah has served her full 4-month regional term
    And she has reviewed 35 complex cases establishing regional precedent
    When her term ends
    Then Sarah returns to her regular life with deeper constitutional understanding
    And she has contributed to shaping regional governance for years to come
    And her deliberations inform how agents and communities operate
    And she has formed relationships with diverse citizens across the region
    And she is eligible for selection to national-layer council in future
    And her capacity for democratic participation has expanded significantly
