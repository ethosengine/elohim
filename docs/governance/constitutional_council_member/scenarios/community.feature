Feature: Community-Level Constitutional Council Deliberation for Council Member
  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to provide democratic oversight of AI decisions through citizen deliberation
  So that agent governance remains accountable without being controllable

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the constitutional_council_member user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active
    And Sarah Martinez is serving her 3-month term on community council

  Scenario: Random selection to serve on community Constitutional Council
    Given I am a nurse and mother living in my community
    And I have never been politically active
    When I receive notification of sortition selection for Constitutional Council
    Then I am randomly selected via cryptographic sortition
    And I am offered 3-month term serving 20 hours per week
    And I receive compensation matching local median income
    And I am provided childcare support and accessibility accommodations
    And I can accept or decline without penalty
    And Selection cannot be lobbied or manipulated
    And My service brings ordinary citizen wisdom to AI governance

  Scenario: Intensive training prepares me for constitutional interpretation
    Given I have accepted my Constitutional Council appointment
    And I need to understand constitutional principles to judge agent decisions
    When I complete 3-week training program
    Then I learn: constitutional principles and their application
    And I study: how agents reason and make decisions
    And I practice: deliberation protocols and consensus building
    And I review: historical precedents and case studies
    And I am educated: without being indoctrinated about "correct" answers
    And I develop: judgment capacity not just knowledge
    And I feel: prepared to serve despite lack of formal expertise

  Scenario: Reviewing my first appeal case with fellow council members
    Given Marcus appealed his Family Elohim's mental health intervention decision
    And I am reviewing this case with my diverse council
    When we deliberate on whether the agent followed constitutional bounds
    Then I bring: my nurse perspective on mental health and care
    And retired teacher brings: education and developmental insights
    And construction worker brings: working-class resource constraint understanding
    And grad student brings: research and analytical skills
    And business owner brings: economic and practical judgment
    And together we form: collective wisdom greater than any individual
    And we ask: "Did this demonstrate love as committed action?"

  Scenario: Balancing technical expert advice with my human judgment
    Given Marcus's case involves complex pattern detection algorithms
    And I don't understand the technical details
    When technical expert Dr. Okonkwo explains the agent's reasoning
    Then she translates: cryptographic proofs into accessible language
    And she clarifies: what confidence levels mean and their limitations
    And she acknowledges: uncertainties and competing interpretations
    And she informs: but doesn't tell us what decision is right
    And I weigh: her technical knowledge alongside my human wisdom
    And I judge: whether constitutional principles were honored
    And I respect: expertise without surrendering my judgment authority

  Scenario: Deliberating with structured process ensuring all voices heard
    Given our council has diverse perspectives that could lead to conflict
    And we need to reach judgment together
    When we follow deliberation protocols
    Then all members: share initial reactions and concerns
    And we identify: points of agreement and disagreement
    And we examine: constitutional principles explicitly
    And we research: relevant precedents from previous cases
    And we consult: experts when technical questions arise
    And we avoid: rushed judgment or groupthink
    And we ensure: quieter members are heard not dominated
    And we reach: decision through genuine collective deliberation

  Scenario: Creating precedent that will guide future cases
    Given our council rules on Marcus's mental health intervention appeal
    And we affirm the agent's decision as constitutionally aligned
    When we document our reasoning and recommendations
    Then we explain: why privacy was balanced against care in this case
    And we recommend: protocol enhancements for pre-specified preferences
    And we create: precedent that future councils can reference
    And we document: our deliberation process (anonymized)
    And we contribute: to evolving constitutional interpretation
    And our judgment: becomes part of public constitutional record
    And Marcus's case: makes the protocol better for everyone

  Scenario: Ruling against agent decision when constitutional bounds exceeded
    Given I am reviewing an appeal where agent clearly overstepped
    And the facts show the decision violated constitutional principles
    When our council rules the agent decision unconstitutional
    Then the decision is: immediately overturned
    And appellant's preferences are: automatically restored
    And the incident is: documented as error in agent's record
    And similar interventions: require higher thresholds going forward
    And protocol improvements are: proposed and implemented
    And agent learns: from legitimate critique without being punished
    And accountability works: without compromising agent autonomy

  Scenario: Experiencing the weight of judgment affecting real lives
    Given my decision will affect Marcus's mental health support
    And I cannot hide behind procedure or defer to experts
    When I must judge knowing uncertainty and consequences
    Then I feel: the burden of democratic responsibility
    And I grapple: with possibility I might be wrong
    And I draw on: my experience as nurse who has seen suffering
    And I consider: my role as mother navigating care and autonomy
    And I accept: that I must judge despite uncertainty
    And I am supported: through compensation, training, and respect
    And I learn: what democratic participation means at deepest level

  Scenario: Seeing patterns across multiple appeals inform community calibration
    Given our council has reviewed 50 appeals over two months
    And I notice recurring themes and tensions
    When I observe patterns in appeal types and outcomes
    Then I see: many adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging
    And I notice: three business loan denials with similar criteria
    And I identify: recurring privacy threshold concerns
    And I share: these observations with community leader
    And community can: consider local protocol calibration
    And my service: informs democratic governance beyond individual cases
    And patterns reveal: community-wide issues requiring deliberation

  Scenario: Term limits protect me from capture while preserving learning
    Given I have served my 3-month community council term
    And I have developed constitutional literacy and deliberation skills
    When my term ends and I return to nursing work
    Then I cannot: serve consecutive terms or be reappointed
    And I cannot: build career in council governance
    And I am protected: from lobbying, corruption, or capture
    And I carry forward: constitutional understanding into community life
    And I remain: engaged citizen with enhanced democratic capacity
    And my institutional knowledge: is preserved through documentation
    And fresh perspectives: replace mine to prevent ossification

  Scenario: Anonymous service when facing community controversy
    Given I am reviewing a highly controversial local case
    And I am concerned about community pressure or retaliation
    When I request anonymous service protections
    Then my identity is: revealed only to verification systems
    And I can: serve without public knowing who I am
    And I am protected: from intimidation or capture attempts
    And I can: deliberate freely without fear
    And cryptographic proofs: verify I'm legitimate member without revealing identity
    And my judgment: maintains democratic legitimacy despite anonymity
