Feature: Community Governance for Constitutional Council Member
  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to review edge case appeals and interpret constitutional alignment
  So that citizens receive democratic oversight and agents remain accountable without capture

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Sarah Martinez has been selected via sortition for 3-month community council term
    And the community governance context is active in Riverside
    And Sarah has completed intensive constitutional training
    And Sarah's council meets weekly to review 5-10 cases per session

  Scenario: Review first case with intensive deliberation
    Given Sarah is serving her first week on the Constitutional Council
    And Marcus's mental health intervention appeal has been escalated
    And the case involves balancing privacy with care
    When Sarah's council convenes to review the appeal
    Then the council receives Marcus's appeal statement and supporting evidence
    And the council reviews Family Elohim's constitutional reasoning
    And the council examines Community Elohim's initial determination
    And the council has access to precedent database for similar cases
    And technical expert Amara Okonkwo explains pattern detection in plain language
    And Sarah and fellow council members deliberate for 2 hours
    And the council focuses on "did agent operate within constitutional bounds"
    And Sarah brings her nursing experience to understanding mental health care

  Scenario: Affirm agent decision while recommending protocol improvement
    Given Sarah's council has deliberated on Marcus's case
    And the council determines the agent followed proper protocol
    When the council issues its determination
    Then the decision affirms the Family Elohim's intervention was constitutional
    And the reasoning acknowledges Marcus's legitimate privacy concerns
    And the decision balances "love as committed action" with dignity principles
    And the council recommends clearer thresholds for future interventions
    And the council suggests pre-specified preference options for users
    And the recommendation is forwarded to protocol development team
    And Marcus receives meaningful recourse even though decision is affirmed
    And the case becomes precedent in constitutional database

  Scenario: Council members with diverse backgrounds deliberate together
    Given Sarah's council includes retired teacher, construction worker, grad student, and business owner
    And they are reviewing community resource allocation appeal
    When the council deliberates
    Then each member brings different lived experience to the discussion
    And the teacher sees education implications
    And the construction worker understands resource constraints
    And the grad student contributes research skills
    And the business owner knows economic trade-offs
    And Sarah brings healthcare and care perspective
    And the structured deliberation ensures all voices are heard equally
    And collective wisdom emerges that no individual could achieve alone

  Scenario: Handle personal constitutional question from council member
    Given Sarah is confused about how constitutional principle applies
    And the case involves adolescent autonomy versus parental protection
    When Sarah asks for clarification during deliberation
    Then facilitator provides constitutional history and precedent
    And technical expert explains how agents weight competing principles
    And fellow council members share their perspectives
    And Sarah develops deeper constitutional understanding
    And the deliberation becomes learning opportunity
    And Sarah gains confidence in her judgment through collaborative process

  Scenario: Identify pattern across multiple appeals requiring systemic change
    Given Sarah's council reviews several adolescent autonomy appeals over 3 weeks
    And multiple Riverside families report Family Elohim being overly restrictive
    When Sarah recognizes the pattern and raises it
    Then the council analyzes all related cases together
    And the council identifies systematic over-calibration issue
    And the council determines this is not individual agent error but calibration problem
    And the council recommends community-specific threshold adjustment
    And Mayor Jamal Washington is briefed to facilitate community dialogue
    And the council's pattern recognition prevents future constitutional violations

  Scenario: Fast-track clear agent error without extensive deliberation
    Given an appeal involves verifiable factual error (wrong address data)
    And the error is not a constitutional question but technical mistake
    When Sarah's council reviews the case
    Then the council immediately identifies this as fast-track resolution
    And the council overturns the decision within 24 hours
    And the appellant receives apology and compensation
    And the council flags root cause for systematic fix
    And council time is preserved for genuinely difficult constitutional questions

  Scenario: Interpret constitutional principles with local cultural context
    Given Riverside has indigenous heritage with river-centered spirituality
    And appeal involves Ecosystem Elohim's watershed protection decision
    When Sarah's council interprets "love as committed action"
    Then the council considers local spiritual relationship to river
    And the council respects both universal constitutional minimums and local specificity
    And the council consults with indigenous community members
    And the interpretation honors cultural context while maintaining core principles
    And the precedent is documented specifically for Riverside context

  Scenario: Navigate disagreement within council through structured process
    Given Sarah's council is split 3-2 on whether agent decision was constitutional
    And genuine uncertainty exists about privacy threshold
    When the council follows deliberation protocol
    Then minority view is fully documented with reasoning
    And majority explains why they reached different conclusion
    And both perspectives acknowledge legitimate competing values
    And the decision includes dissent to inform future deliberations
    And Sarah votes her conscience without pressure to conform
    And the disagreement is respectful and productive

  Scenario: Receive community context to inform constitutional judgment
    Given appeal involves surveillance concern in neighborhood with police violence history
    And Sarah's council needs historical context to understand sensitivities
    When Mayor Jamal provides community context
    Then Jamal explains why surveillance concerns are especially salient here
    And Jamal provides cultural background without directing judgment
    And Sarah's council incorporates this context into constitutional interpretation
    And local knowledge improves decision quality
    And the council maintains its authority while learning from community wisdom

  Scenario: Complete 3-month term and return to regular life
    Given Sarah has served her full 3-month council term
    And she has reviewed 45 cases and helped establish local precedents
    When her term ends
    Then Sarah returns to her nursing work
    And she cannot serve consecutive terms (preventing capture)
    And her deliberations are documented in precedent database
    And she has gained constitutional literacy and deliberative skills
    And she participates differently in her community as informed citizen
    And she might be selected again in future for higher governance layer
    And ordinary citizen has become extraordinary through democratic participation
