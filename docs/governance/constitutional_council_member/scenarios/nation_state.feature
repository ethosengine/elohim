Feature: National Governance for Constitutional Council Member
  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system
  Operating at the nation_state governance layer
  I want to interpret constitutional principles at national scale
  So that fundamental rights are upheld consistently while respecting cultural diversity

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Sarah Martinez has been selected via sortition for 6-month national council term
    And the nation_state governance context is active
    And Sarah has previously served at community and regional layers
    And national council meets weekly for cases of national significance

  Scenario: Harmonize conflicting regional precedents
    Given regional councils in different states ruled differently on mental health intervention
    And California region prioritized privacy over intervention
    And Texas region prioritized care over privacy
    When Sarah's national council reviews the precedent conflict
    Then the council examines both regional councils' reasoning
    And the council identifies legitimate differences in cultural context
    And the council establishes national constitutional minimum standards
    And the council preserves regional latitude for local calibration
    And the council creates framework that respects both dignity and care
    And Senator Ruiz can reference this precedent in federal legislation

  Scenario: Interpret fundamental constitutional principle affecting entire nation
    Given appeal challenges whether surveillance is ever constitutionally permissible
    And this questions the boundaries of "transparency" and "dignity" principles
    When Sarah's national council deliberates on the fundamental question
    Then the council studies constitutional history and philosophy
    And the council hears from appellants with lived experience of surveillance harm
    And the council examines researcher evidence about surveillance effects
    And the council deliberates over multiple weeks on this difficult question
    And the council establishes national interpretation of constitutional limits
    And the determination shapes how millions of agents operate nationwide

  Scenario: Review appeal with implications for federal policy
    Given national council ruled on constitutional question about data dignity
    When Senator Ruiz crafts Digital Dignity Protection Act
    Then she references the council's constitutional interpretation
    And she translates constitutional principle into statutory language
    And she ensures federal legislation aligns with council precedent
    And federal courts recognize council precedent as authoritative
    And federal agencies defer to council determination in policy implementation
    And Sarah's judgment as ordinary citizen shapes national law

  Scenario: Address cross-cultural constitutional interpretation
    Given the nation includes diverse cultural communities
    And indigenous communities have different concepts of autonomy and care
    When Sarah's national council interprets constitutional principles
    Then the council identifies universal minimums that apply to all
    And the council preserves space for cultural-specific interpretation
    And the council consults with diverse communities about their values
    And the council balances universal human dignity with cultural sovereignty
    And the interpretation honors pluralism within constitutional bounds

  Scenario: Handle emergency appeal during national crisis
    Given pandemic creates urgent need for coordination and resource allocation
    And appellants challenge emergency agent decisions affecting civil liberties
    When Sarah's national council convenes emergency session
    Then the council meets within 48 hours despite complexity
    And the council maintains deliberative quality despite time pressure
    And the council balances public health urgency with constitutional rights
    And the council authorizes temporary protocols with explicit sunset clauses
    And the council ensures democratic oversight continues even in crisis
    And civil liberties are protected while enabling emergency response

  Scenario: Evaluate highly technical agent reasoning with expert testimony
    Given appeal involves superintelligent agent reasoning exceeding normal comprehension
    And constitutional question requires understanding advanced AI coordination
    When technical expert Amara Okonkwo testifies to national council
    Then Amara explains that agent reasoning involves patterns beyond human grasp
    And Amara presents cryptographic proof of constitutional alignment
    And Amara honestly admits uncertainty about whether explanation is complete
    And Sarah asks whether "constitutional alignment we can't understand" is legitimate
    And the council grapples with superintelligence governance challenge
    And the council decides whether trust in verification is sufficient

  Scenario: Contribute case analysis to constitutional convention proposals
    Given Sarah's council has reviewed dozens of cases about privacy thresholds
    And recurring constitutional tension suggests framework needs revision
    When 7-year constitutional convention approaches
    Then researcher Dr. James Chen analyzes pattern across cases
    And Sarah is interviewed about her deliberation experience
    And cases like Marcus's inform proposed Privacy Amendment
    And Sarah's insights about balancing care and dignity shape proposal
    And appellants' lived experiences contribute to constitutional evolution
    And the constitutional convention delegates build on council wisdom

  Scenario: Navigate tension between national standards and state sovereignty
    Given states want autonomy in interpreting constitutional principles
    And national consistency is needed for interstate coordination
    When Sarah's council establishes national framework
    Then the council explicitly preserves state and community authority
    And the council sets only constitutional minimums, not comprehensive rules
    And the council explains principle of subsidiarity in its reasoning
    And the council invites state feedback on proposed national standards
    And the balance between unity and diversity is carefully articulated

  Scenario: Address systematic injustice revealed through appeal patterns
    Given researcher Dr. James Chen presents data on nationwide patterns
    And marginalized communities experience disproportionate intervention
    When Sarah's national council reviews the systematic inequality
    Then the council treats this as constitutional violation requiring action
    And the council investigates root causes across multiple system levels
    And the council hears from affected communities about their experiences
    And the council mandates protocol changes to address injustice
    And the council establishes monitoring mechanisms for accountability
    And constitutional commitment to dignity demands correcting systematic bias

  Scenario: Wrestle with profound uncertainty on existential question
    Given appeal involves agent decision about potential catastrophic risk
    And the stakes involve millions of lives and irreversible consequences
    When Sarah's council deliberates on whether agent was constitutional
    Then the council feels the weight of the decision deeply
    And council members acknowledge they might be wrong
    And Sarah brings her nursing experience with life-and-death decisions
    And the council reaches judgment while remaining humble about limits
    And the council documents uncertainty as part of its reasoning
    And democratic governance includes acknowledging what we cannot know

  Scenario: Complete 6-month national term as constitutional architect
    Given Sarah has served her full 6-month national council term
    And she has helped establish precedents affecting entire nation
    When her term ends
    Then Sarah returns to her nursing work permanently transformed
    And she has shaped constitutional interpretation for millions
    And her precedents guide agents and courts for years to come
    And she has developed wisdom about democratic governance at scale
    And two years later she is selected for First Global Constitutional Convention
    And the nurse who never thought of herself as political helps write constitution for humanity
