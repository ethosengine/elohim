Feature: Community Governance for Appellant
  As an appellant in the governance system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want first-layer appeal review by Community Elohim within my local context
  So that appeals are resolved quickly with understanding of community norms and resources

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the appellant user is registered in Riverside community
    And the community governance context is active
    And a Family Elohim decision has been appealed

  Scenario: Immediate community-layer review of family agent decision
    Given Marcus has appealed his Family Elohim's mental health intervention
    And the appeal was submitted 30 minutes ago
    When the Community Elohim reviews the appeal
    Then the review completes within 90 seconds
    And the Community Elohim examines Family Elohim's constitutional reasoning
    And the Community Elohim considers local mental health resources availability
    And the Community Elohim evaluates cultural norms around privacy and care
    And the Community Elohim determines if Family Elohim followed proper protocol
    And Marcus receives the Community Elohim's determination immediately
    And the determination is explained in plain language

  Scenario: Community appeal affirms original decision with protocol enhancement
    Given Marcus's appeal has been reviewed by Community Elohim
    And the Family Elohim's decision was constitutionally sound
    When Community Elohim issues its determination
    Then the original decision is affirmed
    And the reasoning acknowledges Marcus's legitimate privacy concerns
    And the determination recommends pre-specified alert preferences feature
    And the recommendation is forwarded to protocol development team
    And Marcus is notified of both the affirmation and the recommendation
    And Marcus can escalate to peer review if still unsatisfied

  Scenario: Community layer resolves appeal through better explanation
    Given an appellant is confused about agent decision
    And the Family Elohim's initial explanation was too technical
    When Community Elohim reviews the appeal
    Then Community Elohim provides clearer plain-language explanation
    And Community Elohim shows counterfactual scenarios
    And Community Elohim identifies communication failure not decision error
    And the appellant gains understanding without escalation
    And the appeal is resolved within hours
    And the explanation method is documented for future improvement

  Scenario: Community detects pattern in multiple similar appeals
    Given multiple Riverside residents appeal adolescent autonomy decisions
    And the appeals all involve Family Elohim being overly restrictive
    When Community Elohim reviews the pattern
    Then Community Elohim identifies systematic over-calibration issue
    And Community Elohim alerts the community Constitutional Council
    And Community Elohim recommends community-specific calibration
    And Mayor Jamal Washington is briefed on the pattern
    And community dialogue is initiated about appropriate thresholds
    And protocol calibration is adjusted for Riverside context

  Scenario: Fast-track resolution for clear agent error
    Given a Family Elohim made a decision based on wrong address
    And the error is factually verifiable
    When Community Elohim reviews the appeal
    Then Community Elohim immediately identifies the data error
    And the decision is overturned within 24 hours
    And the appellant is notified with apology for the error
    And compensation is provided for any harm caused
    And the root cause is flagged for systematic fix
    And no further escalation is required

  Scenario: Consider local context in constitutional interpretation
    Given Riverside has indigenous heritage with river-centered spirituality
    And an appeal involves ecological intervention decision
    When Community Elohim interprets constitutional principles
    Then local cultural values about sacred relationship to river are considered
    And constitutional principle "love as committed action" is interpreted locally
    And Riverside's specific cultural context informs the determination
    And the determination respects both universal minimums and local specificity
    And precedent is documented for future Riverside cases

  Scenario: Escalate appeal when community layer cannot resolve
    Given Marcus is not satisfied with Community Elohim's determination
    And the constitutional question is genuinely contested
    When Marcus requests peer review escalation
    Then the appeal is immediately forwarded to Level 2 peer review
    And three randomly-selected Family Elohim from other communities are assigned
    And a Constitutional Council observer is notified
    And Marcus is informed of the escalation timeline
    And the peer review process begins within 72 hours
    And Marcus's right to escalate is honored without penalty
