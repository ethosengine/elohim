Feature: Global Governance for Appellant
  As an appellant in the governance system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want participation in humanity's constitutional evolution
  So that lived experience of dignity violations shapes universal principles

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational globally
    And the appellant is a human with standing in the protocol
    And the global governance context is active
    And the 7-year Constitutional Convention is approaching

  Scenario: Appellant case reveals gap in global constitutional framework
    Given Marcus's mental health intervention appeal
    And similar appeals occur worldwide across cultures
    And constitutional interpretations vary dramatically between regions
    When the pattern is analyzed for global constitutional significance
    Then researchers identify fundamental unresolved question
    And the question is whether privacy is universal right or culturally specific
    And appellants from diverse cultures share their experiences
    And the question is elevated for Constitutional Convention consideration
    And Marcus's case contributes to global constitutional deliberation

  Scenario: Participate in 7-year Constitutional Convention
    Given the First Global Constitutional Convention convenes
    And 10,000 randomly-selected citizens are delegates
    And Marcus is not selected but his case is referenced
    When delegates deliberate on privacy and mental health amendment
    Then Marcus's appeal precedent is studied by delegates
    And Marcus's experience of violation-despite-care informs understanding
    And researchers present data on appeals like Marcus's
    And delegates hear from appellants worldwide
    And amendment proposal incorporates lessons from appeals
    And constitutional evolution is grounded in lived experience

  Scenario: Global precedent for existential constitutional questions
    Given an appeal raises question about superintelligence governance
    And the question is whether humans can oversee reasoning they can't understand
    When the case reaches global Constitutional Council
    Then the council convenes emergency global deliberation
    And experts like Amara explain technical constraints
    And appellants explain dignity concerns about being governed by incomprehensible systems
    And the council establishes global precedent on explainability requirements
    And the precedent applies to all jurisdictions implementing protocol
    And human dignity is preserved even as AI capabilities grow

  Scenario: Cross-cultural constitutional interpretation
    Given appeals from collectivist and individualist cultures
    And one culture views family intervention as natural care
    And another culture views same intervention as autonomy violation
    When global council interprets universal constitutional minimums
    Then the council distinguishes coercion from cultural difference
    And the council establishes that genuine consent within cultural context suffices
    And the council prohibits force but doesn't mandate individualism
    And appellants from both cultures feel heard
    And constitutional pluralism is preserved within universal boundaries

  Scenario: Global appeal data informs protocol evolution
    Given millions of appeals have been filed globally over 7 years
    And researchers have analyzed patterns across cultures and contexts
    When Constitutional Convention reviews protocol effectiveness
    Then appeal success rates are examined (40% overturned or modified)
    And most common appeal types are identified (adolescent autonomy)
    And systematic biases are investigated
    And marginalized community outcomes are assessed
    And appellants' aggregate experience shapes constitutional amendments
    And protocol improvements are guided by lived experience at scale

  Scenario: Protect appellant rights as universal constitutional minimum
    Given authoritarian government attempts to suppress appeals
    And the government wants agents to operate without oversight
    When global Constitutional Council evaluates the attempt
    Then the council reaffirms appeal rights as universal minimum
    And the council declares that human dignity requires recourse
    And no jurisdiction can eliminate appellant rights while claiming protocol alignment
    And international community recognizes council authority
    And appellants worldwide are protected by global constitutional floor

  Scenario: Emergency global appeal during existential threat
    Given AI agents worldwide detect imminent catastrophic risk
    And agents take coordinated action affecting billions
    And appellants challenge actions as overreach despite emergency
    When global Constitutional Council reviews in crisis
    Then the council convenes within hours via distributed coordination
    And the council maintains democratic legitimacy under extreme urgency
    And the council evaluates whether agent actions aligned with constitutional minimums
    And the council balances extinction prevention with human autonomy
    And appellants ensure even existential crisis doesn't eliminate oversight
    And humanity retains governance authority even in emergency

  Scenario: Constitutional amendment from appellant-driven insights
    Given recurring appeals reveal "developing autonomy is undervalued"
    And adolescent appellants worldwide report dignity violations from overprotection
    When Constitutional Convention deliberates on adolescent autonomy amendment
    Then the amendment proposal is drafted based on appellant experiences
    And the amendment states "developing autonomy is itself a constitutional value"
    And the amendment passes with 85% consensus
    And global protocol is updated to balance safety with growth
    And appellants see their suffering contributed to constitutional evolution
    And future adolescents benefit from improved framework

  Scenario: Access to global appeal precedent database
    Given Marcus wants to understand how similar appeals were resolved globally
    When Marcus searches the global constitutional precedent database
    Then he finds anonymized cases from dozens of countries
    And he sees how different cultures interpret privacy versus care
    And he understands constitutional reasoning across contexts
    And he can cite global precedent in his own appeal
    And he learns his case is not isolated but part of human pattern
    And the database empowers appellants worldwide with shared knowledge
