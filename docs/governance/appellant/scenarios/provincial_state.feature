Feature: Provincial/State Governance for Appellant
  As an appellant in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer
  I want regional Constitutional Council review for complex appeals
  So that I receive human judgment from randomly-selected peers on constitutional alignment

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the appellant is registered in the regional jurisdiction
    And the provincial/state governance context is active
    And Sarah Martinez serves on the Regional Constitutional Council

  Scenario: Constitutional Council review of escalated mental health appeal
    Given Marcus's appeal has been reviewed by Community Elohim
    And peer agent review has also been conducted
    And the appeal raises novel constitutional questions about privacy thresholds
    When the case is escalated to Regional Constitutional Council
    Then Sarah Martinez and 4 fellow council members are assigned
    And they receive full case documentation including all previous reviews
    And they conduct two hours of deliberation without rushing
    And they examine Family Elohim's constitutional reasoning
    And they evaluate whether agent operated within constitutional bounds
    And they consider Marcus's lived experience of dignity violation
    And they create precedent that will guide future similar cases

  Scenario: Council deliberates with access to technical expertise
    Given Constitutional Council is reviewing complex agent decision
    And the case involves pattern detection algorithms
    When the council needs technical clarification
    Then technical expert Amara Okonkwo provides testimony
    And Amara explains pattern detection in accessible language
    And Amara acknowledges 15% uncertainty in suicide risk assessment
    And Amara does not advocate for specific outcome
    And the council asks critical questions about technical claims
    And the council makes final judgment on constitutional alignment
    And expert testimony informs but does not dominate the decision

  Scenario: Create precedent with recommendations for protocol improvement
    Given Constitutional Council has deliberated on Marcus's case
    When the council issues its determination
    Then the decision affirms agent followed constitutional bounds
    But the council also identifies room for improvement
    And the council recommends pre-specified alert preferences feature
    And the council recommends clearer mental health intervention thresholds
    And the council recommends post-intervention review including appellant perspective
    And the precedent is published in public constitutional record
    And protocol developers implement the recommendations
    And Marcus sees his experience contributed to system improvement

  Scenario: Respect appellant dignity even when affirming agent decision
    Given Marcus appealed feeling violated by mental health intervention
    And Constitutional Council determines agent decision was constitutional
    When the council communicates its determination to Marcus
    Then the council acknowledges Marcus's anger is legitimate
    And the council explains they asked "did agent operate within bounds?" not "was Marcus wrong?"
    And the council recognizes intervention saved life but also violated privacy
    And the council treats dignity violation as real even when intervention justified
    And Marcus's appeal is honored as meaningful participation
    And Marcus receives the determination with reasoning transparency

  Scenario: Establish regional precedent affecting multiple communities
    Given multiple communities in the region have similar appeals
    And all involve adolescent autonomy versus safety conflicts
    When Constitutional Council reviews pattern across appeals
    Then the council establishes regional precedent
    And the precedent articulates "developing autonomy is constitutional value"
    And the precedent balances safety with growth needs
    And the precedent guides future agent decisions across region
    And community leaders like Jamal Washington can reference it
    And the precedent becomes part of constitutional database

  Scenario: Transparent deliberation with documented reasoning
    Given Constitutional Council deliberates on appellant's case
    When the council reaches its determination
    Then the decision is documented with clear reasoning
    And the documentation includes constitutional principles at stake
    And the documentation includes anonymized deliberation summary
    And the documentation includes dissenting views if any
    And the documentation is added to public precedent database
    And researchers can study the deliberation patterns
    And future councils can search and reference this case

  Scenario: Appeal timeline meets mandatory deadlines
    Given Marcus's appeal was escalated to Constitutional Council
    And the appeal was received by council 5 days ago
    When Marcus checks appeal status
    Then he sees council is on track to meet 3-week deadline
    And he sees council scheduled deliberation session for next week
    And he receives proactive updates if timeline might slip
    And the system prioritizes urgent cases appropriately
    And Marcus knows when to expect final determination
    And the timely process demonstrates respect for his rights

  Scenario: Appellant participation in council review
    Given Constitutional Council is reviewing Marcus's case
    When Marcus is invited to present his perspective
    Then Marcus can participate orally, in writing, or via video
    And language translation is provided if needed
    And accessibility accommodations are available
    And Marcus can have representative assist if desired
    And council members listen without prejudgment
    And Marcus feels genuinely heard by peers not distant bureaucrats
    And the participation strengthens legitimacy of the process

  Scenario: Protection from retaliation for filing appeal
    Given Marcus filed appeal against Family Elohim decision
    And months have passed since the appeal was resolved
    When Marcus interacts with agents for other matters
    Then his appeal history does not negatively bias agent decisions
    And agents treat him with same care as non-appellants
    And community members do not ostracize him for challenging agents
    And appeals are treated as right not privilege
    And Marcus faces no penalties for exercising recourse
