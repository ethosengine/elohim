Feature: National Governance for Appellant
  As an appellant in the governance system
  Operating at the national governance layer
  I want highest-level constitutional interpretation for fundamental questions
  So that core principles are upheld consistently across all communities

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the appellant is a national citizen
    And the nation_state governance context is active
    And regional councils have split on constitutional interpretation

  Scenario: Escalate when regional councils reach conflicting precedents
    Given regional councils in different provinces ruled differently
    And one council prioritized privacy over mental health intervention
    And another council prioritized care over privacy rights
    When Marcus's type of case reaches national Constitutional Council
    Then the national council harmonizes the conflicting interpretations
    And the council establishes national precedent on privacy thresholds
    And the precedent respects both care and dignity principles
    And the precedent guides all regional and community agents
    And policy makers like Senator Ruiz can reference it in legislation

  Scenario: Appeal raising fundamental constitutional question
    Given an appeal challenges whether mental health intervention ever justifies privacy breach
    And this is not about protocol implementation but constitutional principle
    When the case reaches national Constitutional Council
    Then the council deliberates on fundamental rights balance
    And the council consults constitutional history and philosophy
    And the council hears from appellants with lived experience
    And the council examines evidence from researchers about intervention outcomes
    And the council establishes whether privacy is absolute or has exceptions
    And the determination shapes constitutional understanding nationally

  Scenario: National precedent affects policy and legislation
    Given national Constitutional Council established mental health intervention precedent
    When Senator Ruiz crafts legislation on digital dignity
    Then she references the council's constitutional interpretation
    And she translates precedent into statutory language
    And she ensures legislation aligns with constitutional principles
    And courts recognize council precedent as authoritative interpretation
    And government agencies defer to council determination
    And the appellant's case has influenced national law

  Scenario: Cross-jurisdictional appeal coordination
    Given an appellant's case involves agents from multiple states
    And state boundaries don't align with agent coordination needs
    When the appellant files appeal at national layer
    Then the national council coordinates multi-state review
    And the council ensures consistent constitutional application
    And interstate compacts recognize the council determination
    And federal standards don't override local calibration rights
    And the appellant receives coherent resolution across jurisdictions

  Scenario: Contribute to constitutional database for future appeals
    Given national council has ruled on fundamental constitutional question
    When the determination is documented
    Then it enters the national constitutional precedent database
    And all appellants can search this database for similar cases
    And future councils reference this precedent in deliberations
    And the reasoning is accessible in plain language
    And legal experts can cite it in advocacy
    And the precedent evolves constitutional understanding over time

  Scenario: Emergency appeal during crisis requiring rapid response
    Given a national crisis (pandemic, climate disaster) creates urgent governance needs
    And appellants challenge emergency agent decisions affecting rights
    When emergency appeal reaches national council
    Then the council convenes within 48 hours
    And the council maintains democratic legitimacy despite urgency
    And the council balances emergency needs with constitutional rights
    And the council authorizes temporary protocols with sunset provisions
    And the appellant receives rapid but deliberative review
    And democratic oversight is maintained even in crisis

  Scenario: Appeal informs constitutional convention proposals
    Given Marcus's appeal revealed fundamental gap in privacy framework
    And multiple national cases show recurring constitutional tension
    When the 7-year constitutional convention approaches
    Then Marcus's case is analyzed by researchers
    And researchers identify systemic constitutional questions
    And proposal is drafted for convention consideration
    And appellants' lived experiences inform constitutional evolution
    And Marcus's suffering contributes to improving the framework
    And the convention delegates deliberate on privacy amendments
