Feature: Global Governance for Researcher
  As a researcher in the governance system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want to conduct cross-cultural analysis and study constitutional conventions
  So that universal patterns and cultural specificity are rigorously understood

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational in 60 countries
    And Dr. James Chen leads international research consortium
    And the global governance context is active
    And research examines whether democratic AI governance is culturally universal
    And James coordinates with researchers across diverse cultural contexts

  Scenario: Lead international research consortium across cultures
    Given protocol operates in individualist and collectivist cultures
    And researchers in US, Japan, Kenya, Brazil, and Norway collaborate
    When James coordinates global comparative study
    Then researchers use common measurement instruments
    And researchers adapt methods to cultural contexts
    And research examines universal patterns vs cultural specificity
    And findings are published in multiple languages
    And global research reveals whether protocol principles are universal

  Scenario: Study First Global Constitutional Convention as deliberative democracy experiment
    Given 10,000 randomly-selected citizens from 180 countries convene
    And this is largest sortition deliberation in human history
    When James and research team observe the convention
    Then they document how citizens deliberate across profound cultural difference
    And they analyze what enables productive disagreement vs polarization
    And they track how constitutional amendments emerge from deliberation
    And they examine whether global sortition achieves democratic legitimacy
    And they study whether wisdom emerges from diverse collective deliberation

  Scenario: Analyze whether cultural context shapes constitutional interpretation
    Given "dignity" means different things in different cultures
    When James examines constitutional interpretation across countries
    Then he finds universal agreement on core principles
    And he discovers legitimate variation in how principles are applied
    And he identifies that collectivist cultures emphasize community dignity
    And he observes individualist cultures emphasize personal autonomy
    And he documents how protocol enables both within constitutional bounds

  Scenario: Testify at Global Constitutional Convention on superintelligence governance
    Given convention debates whether sortition can oversee superintelligence
    And James has researched this question for years
    When James presents findings to 10,000 delegates
    Then he shows councils currently work well with human-comprehensible agents
    And he presents evidence that council confidence decreases as agent capability increases
    And he documents concerning trend toward expert deference
    And he also shows councils aware of danger actively resist it
    And he concludes question remains open whether democracy can govern superintelligence
    And his research informs existential constitutional question

  Scenario: Examine whether Ecological Standing Amendment reflects cross-cultural wisdom
    Given convention passed amendment giving ecosystems legal personhood
    And this was controversial across different cultural traditions
    When James analyzes deliberation and voting patterns
    Then he finds indigenous communities strongly supported amendment
    And he discovers surprising support from industrial nations
    And he examines how delegates reached consensus across difference
    And he documents that lived experience with ecological collapse drove convergence
    And cross-cultural constitutional evolution is empirically captured

  Scenario: Study whether protocol governance works in authoritarian contexts
    Given some protocol-adopting countries have authoritarian governments
    When James examines protocol operation in diverse political systems
    Then he finds protocol creates democratic spaces even under authoritarianism
    And he documents that governments struggle to capture sortition councils
    And he identifies attempted interference and resistance patterns
    And he examines whether protocol becomes target for authoritarian suppression
    And research reveals protocol's potential and limits as democratic tool

  Scenario: Compare protocol governance to other democratic innovation models
    Given many countries experiment with citizens assemblies and participatory budgeting
    When James conducts comparative analysis across governance models
    Then he examines sortition vs elected representatives
    And he compares protocol councils to expert panels
    And he evaluates participatory budgeting vs protocol resource allocation
    And he finds each model has strengths and weaknesses
    And he provides evidence for governance model selection

  Scenario: Investigate global patterns in appeal resolution
    Given millions of appeals processed worldwide over 7 years
    When James analyzes global appeal database
    Then he identifies universal patterns (mental health intervention appeals common)
    And he discovers cultural variation (adolescent autonomy thresholds differ)
    And he examines whether appeal success rates are equitable globally
    And he flags systematic biases requiring attention
    And global data reveals both universals and cultural specificity

  Scenario: Provide research evidence to international policy forums
    Given international organizations debate AI governance models
    When James presents research at UN and World Economic Forum
    Then he shows evidence that democratic protocol governance works
    And he demonstrates this across diverse cultural contexts
    And he contrasts with surveillance-based authoritarian model
    And he presents with intellectual honesty about limitations
    And research influences international governance discourse

  Scenario: Study generational effects in protocol-native youth globally
    Given children worldwide are growing up with protocol
    When James coordinates international study of protocol-native generation
    Then researchers track youth civic development across cultures
    And they compare protocol-exposed to non-exposed youth
    And they find globally consistent pattern of enhanced democratic capacity
    And they document cultural variation in how capacity manifests
    And generational research reveals transformative potential

  Scenario: Examine whether trust in protocol generalizes across cultural contexts
    Given trust is claimed to result from transparency and accountability
    When James measures trust across diverse cultures
    Then he finds trust building in individualist cultures (US, Europe)
    And he discovers different trust dynamics in collectivist cultures (East Asia)
    And he identifies that transparency means different things culturally
    And he concludes trust mechanisms must adapt to cultural context
    And cross-cultural research informs protocol design

  Scenario: Publish comprehensive global assessment in Nature
    Given James and consortium have decade of global data
    When they prepare comprehensive assessment of democratic AI governance
    Then they document methodology with full transparency
    And they present findings about what works universally
    And they show what requires cultural adaptation
    And they acknowledge what remains uncertain
    And they make dataset available for global research community
    And they contribute definitive evidence for governance of superintelligent AI
