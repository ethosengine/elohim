Feature: Community-Level Governance Research for Researcher
  As a researcher in the governance system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to conduct intensive case studies of how sortition governance works in practice
  So that I can understand lived experience and inform democratic AI governance theory

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the researcher user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active
    And Dr. James Chen is studying democratic innovation and AI governance

  Scenario: Conducting ethnographic research in Riverside community
    Given I have selected Riverside (population 45,000) for intensive case study
    And I have secured ethical approval and community consent
    When I begin multi-month observation of protocol implementation
    Then I can attend Constitutional Council meetings as observer
    And I can interview appellants like Marcus about their appeal experience
    And I can participate in community deliberations about protocol
    And I can track resource flows and wellbeing indicators
    And I can document challenges and successes as they emerge
    And The community retains ownership of data about themselves
    And My research serves community improvement not just academic publication

  Scenario: Observing Constitutional Council deliberation in real-time
    Given Community Constitutional Council is reviewing Marcus's mental health appeal
    And I have permission to observe their deliberation
    When I document how the council works through the case
    Then I capture: argument patterns, member interactions, uncertainty navigation
    And I analyze: how expertise influences judgment, how dissent gets resolved
    And I examine: quality of deliberation, constitutional reasoning depth
    And I observe: what enables effective citizen governance
    And I document: dynamics that retrospective analysis would miss
    And My research reveals how sortition democracy actually works
    And Findings feed back to improve council support and training

  Scenario: Interviewing appellant about appeal experience and recourse
    Given Marcus appealed his Family Elohim's mental health intervention
    And he has consented to research interview
    When I ask about his experience of the appeal process
    Then he shares: emotional impact of feeling violated then heard
    And he describes: accessibility of appeal interface, dignity of process
    And he explains: how explanation changed his understanding
    And he reflects: reconciliation with agent through meaningful recourse
    And I learn: what made the process feel legitimate despite initial anger
    And I understand: lived experience that statistics cannot capture
    And His story humanizes governance mechanisms for research audience

  Scenario: Tracking community wellbeing indicators over time
    Given Riverside adopted Elohim Protocol three years ago
    And I am measuring community outcomes longitudinally
    When I analyze wellbeing data before and after adoption
    Then I examine: loneliness rates (down 12%), life satisfaction (up 8%)
    And I track: crisis response effectiveness, economic resilience
    And I monitor: social cohesion, trust in institutions, civic participation
    And I conduct: comparison with similar communities without protocol
    And I use: difference-in-differences analysis to isolate protocol effects
    And I distinguish: what's protocol impact vs what's secular trend
    And I provide: evidence about whether democratic AI governance works

  Scenario: Identifying implementation challenges through participant observation
    Given I am embedded in Riverside for six months
    And I observe daily reality of protocol implementation
    When I encounter challenges residents and leaders face
    Then I document: elderly residents struggling with technology
    And I note: three Constitutional Council decisions that residents opposed
    And I observe: recurring tension around adolescent autonomy
    And I identify: gaps between theory and practice
    And I analyze: what enables some communities to thrive while others struggle
    And My research reveals: practical wisdom about implementation
    And Findings help other communities avoid pitfalls Riverside encountered

  Scenario: Collaborating with Mayor Jamal on participatory action research
    Given I want research to serve community not just extract data
    And Mayor Jamal wants evidence to improve local governance
    When we co-design research questions and methods
    Then community priorities shape what we study
    And Local residents participate in data collection
    And We jointly interpret findings considering context I might miss
    And Research addresses actual needs not just academic curiosity
    And Riverside learns from comparative findings across communities
    And Results improve local implementation immediately
    And Research relationship respects community autonomy and knowledge

  Scenario: Analyzing appeal patterns to understand constitutional interpretation
    Given Riverside's Constitutional Council has reviewed 150 appeals over three years
    And I have access to anonymized appeal data
    When I analyze patterns in appeal types, outcomes, and reasoning
    Then I identify: which decisions generate most appeals (adolescent autonomy)
    And I examine: what predicts appeal success (constitutional strength, evidence quality)
    And I track: how constitutional interpretation evolves through precedent
    And I discover: whether marginalized communities have equal access to recourse
    And I assess: if appeal process functions as democratic accountability mechanism
    And My analysis reveals: how procedural justice works in practice
    And Findings inform improvements to appeal accessibility and council training

  Scenario: Studying trust building through transparent governance
    Given trust in institutions is central question for democratic AI
    And Riverside provides natural experiment in transparency effects
    When I measure trust over time and mechanisms that build it
    Then I examine: whether seeing agent reasoning increases confidence
    And I explore: if meaningful recourse builds trust more than perfect decisions
    And I analyze: role of local Constitutional Council in legitimacy
    And I investigate: whether transparency enables manipulation or builds confidence
    And I track: how trust relationships between residents and agents evolve
    And My research tests: whether democratic governance of AI creates sustainable trust
    And Evidence informs: design of governance systems elsewhere

  Scenario: Documenting community-specific calibration process
    Given Riverside calibrated privacy thresholds higher than protocol default
    And this reflected community values and history
    When I document how community calibration happened
    Then I capture: deliberation process that led to calibration decision
    And I analyze: how community exercised sovereignty within constitutional bounds
    And I examine: role of community leader in facilitating values discussion
    And I track: whether calibration actually served community better
    And I study: how local diversity strengthens rather than fragments protocol
    And My research demonstrates: subsidiarity in practice
    And Findings support: community autonomy as democratic AI principle

  Scenario: Ethical data practices respecting community sovereignty
    Given I am studying Riverside residents and their governance
    And I have access to sensitive information about their lives
    When I conduct research following ethical protocols
    Then I obtain: informed consent from all research participants
    And I ensure: anonymization and privacy protection in publications
    And I provide: community review of findings before publication (for accuracy)
    And I share: research benefits with Riverside (payments support community fund)
    And I respect: community right to revoke access if research becomes harmful
    And I practice: research ethics aligned with dignity principles protocol embodies
    And My methodology demonstrates: how to study communities without extracting from them

  Scenario: Research findings immediately improve local governance
    Given my research identified that Constitutional Council deliberations improve with certain information tools
    And I shared findings with Mayor Jamal and council members
    When community decides to implement recommended improvements
    Then research serves practical improvement not just academic knowledge
    And Rapid feedback loop connects insight to implementation
    And Community sees research benefiting them directly
    And Researcher-community trust strengthens through mutual value
    And Knowledge serves flourishing not just publication
    And Research demonstrates: scholarship in service of democracy
