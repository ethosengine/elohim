Feature: Community Governance for Researcher
  As a researcher in the governance system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to conduct intensive case studies and ethnographic observation
  So that lived experience of democratic AI governance is rigorously documented

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational in Riverside community
    And Dr. James Chen is conducting ethnographic research on sortition governance
    And the community governance context is active
    And James has obtained informed consent and ethical review approval
    And Riverside has granted research access with community data sovereignty

  Scenario: Conduct intensive ethnographic observation in Riverside
    Given James is spending 6 months embedded in Riverside
    And he wants to understand how protocol works in practice
    When James begins his fieldwork
    Then he attends Constitutional Council meetings and observes deliberations
    And he interviews appellants like Marcus about their appeal experiences
    And he participates in community meetings about protocol calibration
    And he observes how Mayor Jamal integrates protocol with city governance
    And he documents both successes and failures honestly
    And he captures lived experience that quantitative studies miss

  Scenario: Interview Constitutional Council member about deliberation experience
    Given Sarah Martinez has completed her 3-month council term
    And James wants to understand how citizens learn constitutional reasoning
    When James interviews Sarah
    Then he asks how she felt when first selected
    And he explores how training prepared her without indoctrinating
    And he documents how she navigated uncertainty in difficult cases
    And he learns what influenced her judgment (expertise, peers, lived experience)
    And he discovers how her nursing background shaped her constitutional interpretation
    And he gains insight into citizen wisdom that expertise cannot capture

  Scenario: Document how appellant Marcus experiences appeal process
    Given Marcus appealed his Family Elohim's mental health intervention
    And James is studying whether meaningful recourse builds trust
    When James interviews Marcus at multiple timepoints
    Then he documents Marcus's initial frustration and sense of privacy violation
    And he tracks Marcus's experience through Community Elohim review
    And he observes Marcus's interaction with Constitutional Council process
    And he examines whether Marcus feels heard even when decision is affirmed
    And he assesses how appeal experience affected Marcus's trust in protocol
    And he contributes to understanding recourse effectiveness

  Scenario: Observe community dialogue about protocol calibration
    Given Riverside is debating adolescent autonomy thresholds
    And Mayor Jamal has convened deliberative assembly
    When James observes the community process
    Then he documents how diverse residents (parents, youth, elders) participate
    And he analyzes how community reaches shared understanding across difference
    And he examines whether marginalized voices are heard or excluded
    And he tracks how deliberation leads to locally-calibrated protocol adjustment
    And he captures community sovereignty and democratic participation in action

  Scenario: Study pattern of appeals to identify systematic issues
    Given James has access to anonymized appeal data from Riverside
    When he analyzes the appeal patterns over 18 months
    Then he identifies that adolescent autonomy appeals cluster in certain neighborhoods
    And he discovers correlation with socioeconomic factors
    And he flags potential systematic bias requiring investigation
    And he shares findings with Constitutional Council
    And his research identifies problems that practitioners couldn't see from single cases
    And research feeds back into protocol improvement

  Scenario: Document accessibility barriers for elderly residents
    Given some Riverside elderly lack tech literacy and internet access
    And James is studying equity of protocol access
    When he interviews elderly residents and observes participation
    Then he documents how paper appeal forms enable inclusion
    And he examines whether human service windows provide adequate support
    And he identifies remaining barriers (confusing language, intimidating process)
    And he provides specific recommendations for accessibility improvement
    And his research serves community's interest in universal access

  Scenario: Compare Riverside with non-adopting neighbor community
    Given Riverside adopted protocol three years ago
    And adjacent community of similar demographics did not adopt
    When James compares outcomes between the communities
    Then he measures wellbeing indicators (loneliness, life satisfaction, trust)
    And he finds Riverside shows 12% reduction in loneliness
    And he documents improved crisis response in Riverside
    And he also finds Riverside faces implementation challenges
    And he provides honest assessment of both benefits and costs
    And comparative analysis helps isolate protocol effects from secular trends

  Scenario: Publish research findings with community ownership
    Given James has completed his Riverside ethnography
    When he prepares research for publication
    Then he shares draft with Riverside residents for accuracy review
    And he ensures community members are not reduced to data points
    And he acknowledges community contribution and agency
    And he publishes open access so Riverside can access findings
    And he returns research payments to Riverside community fund
    And he respects community data sovereignty throughout

  Scenario: Present findings at town hall for community benefit
    Given James's research identifies both successes and areas for improvement
    When he presents findings to Riverside at town hall
    Then he shares positive outcomes (wellbeing improvements, trust building)
    And he honestly reports failures (accessibility gaps, remaining biases)
    And he provides actionable recommendations
    And he answers community questions about his methods and findings
    And he demonstrates that research serves community not just academic career
    And Riverside uses his insights to improve local protocol implementation

  Scenario: Contribute qualitative insights to complement quantitative studies
    Given James's ethnography captures meaning and lived experience
    And large-scale quantitative studies show statistical patterns
    When James integrates qualitative and quantitative findings
    Then he explains why appeals increased (not failure but accessible recourse)
    And he contextualizes statistical patterns with human stories
    And he provides depth that numbers alone cannot convey
    And he demonstrates how Marcus's experience illustrates broader pattern
    And mixed methods research provides both breadth and depth
