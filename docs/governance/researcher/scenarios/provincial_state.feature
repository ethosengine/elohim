Feature: Provincial/State Governance for Researcher
  As a researcher in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer
  I want to conduct quantitative comparison studies across communities
  So that generalizable patterns and causal effects can be identified

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational in 150 communities across the state
    And Dr. James Chen is conducting comparative quantitative research
    And the provincial_state governance context is active
    And James has research access to anonymized data from multiple communities
    And ethical review board has approved the research protocol

  Scenario: Conduct large-scale quantitative study across 150 communities
    Given some communities adopted protocol early, others late, some not at all
    When James analyzes outcomes across all communities
    Then he measures wellbeing indicators (loneliness, life satisfaction, social cohesion)
    And he tracks appeal patterns and resolution rates
    And he examines Constitutional Council decision consistency
    And he compares protocol-adopting vs non-adopting communities
    And he uses statistical methods to isolate protocol effects
    And quantitative analysis enables generalization beyond single cases

  Scenario: Use difference-in-differences to estimate protocol impact
    Given communities adopted protocol at different times
    And James can compare before-and-after within communities
    When he conducts difference-in-differences analysis
    Then he tracks communities before protocol adoption (baseline)
    And he tracks same communities after adoption (treatment)
    And he compares to non-adopting communities (control)
    And he estimates causal effect of protocol on wellbeing
    And he finds 8% improvement in life satisfaction and 12% reduction in loneliness
    And statistical method strengthens causal inference

  Scenario: Identify which community characteristics predict successful adoption
    Given protocol works better in some communities than others
    When James analyzes predictors of adoption success
    Then he examines demographics, socioeconomics, political culture, and history
    And he finds communities with civic participation history succeed more
    And he identifies that trust in institutions predicts adoption difficulty
    And he discovers that indigenous communities calibrate differently but successfully
    And he provides evidence-based guidance for future adoption efforts

  Scenario: Analyze regional Constitutional Council decision consistency
    Given regional councils review complex cases establishing precedent
    And consistency is important for constitutional predictability
    When James analyzes council decision patterns
    Then he examines whether similar cases receive similar outcomes
    And he identifies areas of high consistency (privacy thresholds)
    And he identifies areas of high variation (cultural interpretation)
    And he determines whether variation represents bias or legitimate context-specificity
    And his findings help councils understand their own patterns

  Scenario: Study distributional effects across socioeconomic groups
    Given justice requires understanding who benefits and who suffers
    When James examines outcomes by demographic subgroups
    Then he analyzes protocol effects for marginalized vs privileged communities
    And he finds poor communities benefit more (improved resource access)
    And he identifies remaining barriers for undocumented immigrants
    And he discovers that elderly face accessibility challenges
    And he flags systematic biases requiring correction
    And research serves justice by revealing inequality

  Scenario: Evaluate whether Constitutional Council deliberation quality varies by composition
    Given councils are stratified to match population demographics
    When James analyzes how council composition affects outcomes
    Then he examines whether gender, race, or class composition matters
    And he finds diverse councils reach more thorough deliberations
    And he identifies that working-class members bring crucial perspectives
    And he discovers that councils with technical background don't necessarily decide better
    And he validates democratic premise that lived experience equals expertise

  Scenario: Test hypothesis about transparency and trust relationship
    Given transparency is claimed to build trust but might enable manipulation
    When James examines transparency-trust relationship empirically
    Then he measures transparency levels (appeal data, agent reasoning, council records)
    And he measures trust levels (surveys, behavioral proxies)
    And he finds positive correlation up to a threshold
    And he identifies diminishing returns from excessive transparency
    And he provides evidence for optimal transparency design

  Scenario: Provide evidence for Senator Ruiz's policy proposals
    Given Elena Ruiz needs data to justify state funding for protocol
    When James prepares policy brief on research findings
    Then he compiles evidence of protocol effectiveness
    And he documents wellbeing improvements and cost-effectiveness
    And he provides comparison to traditional governance approaches
    And he writes accessible executive summary for legislative staff
    And his rigorous research becomes evidence base for democratic policy

  Scenario: Collaborate with other researchers on multi-site study
    Given protocol operates in multiple states with different contexts
    When James coordinates multi-state research collaboration
    Then he partners with researchers in California, Texas, and Vermont
    And they use common measurement instruments for comparability
    And they examine whether findings generalize across political cultures
    And they publish collaborative analysis in peer-reviewed journal
    And multi-site design strengthens external validity

  Scenario: Conduct natural experiment using geographic boundary
    Given two adjacent communities are similar except one adopted protocol
    And the boundary creates natural comparison
    When James uses regression discontinuity design
    Then he compares communities just on either side of boundary
    And he isolates protocol effect by controlling for other differences
    And he finds protocol community has better crisis response
    And he documents both benefits and implementation costs
    And natural experiment provides strong causal inference

  Scenario: Identify emerging constitutional tensions requiring attention
    Given James has data on appeal patterns across region
    When he analyzes recurring appeal types over 3 years
    Then he identifies increasing appeals about agent-AI coordination
    And he flags emerging constitutional question about superintelligence oversight
    And he alerts regional Constitutional Council to the pattern
    And he publishes findings informing policy debate
    And research provides early warning of governance challenges

  Scenario: Publish findings with appropriate privacy protection
    Given research data contains sensitive information
    When James prepares publication
    Then he uses differential privacy to protect individuals
    And he aggregates data so no community can be identified when sensitive
    And he makes anonymized data publicly available for replication
    And he publishes open access in multiple formats
    And he balances transparency with privacy protection
