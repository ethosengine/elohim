Feature: Community Governance for Community Leader
  As a community_leader in the governance system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to facilitate democratic AI governance integration with existing civic structures
  So that Riverside residents flourish through participatory oversight and local sovereignty

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the community_leader Jamal Washington is mayor of Riverside
    And the community governance context is active
    And Riverside has adopted Elohim Protocol through community referendum

  Scenario: Integrate protocol with existing democratic governance
    Given Riverside has elected city council and traditional civic institutions
    And Community Elohim is operational
    When Jamal coordinates protocol with city government
    Then Community Elohim provides information to council decisions
    And city council retains democratic authority for policy
    And Community Elohim flags when proposed ordinance conflicts with constitutional principles
    And Constitutional Council reviews constitutional conflicts
    And city council deliberates and makes final policy choice
    And protocol augments rather than replaces democratic governance

  Scenario: Present annual protocol review to residents
    Given Riverside has used Elohim Protocol for one year
    When Jamal presents annual review at town hall
    Then he shows data from Transparency Dashboard
    And he reports appeals up 15% indicating recourse is accessible
    And he shows life satisfaction up 8% and loneliness down 12%
    And he acknowledges failures: elderly accessibility issues remain
    And he proposes calibrating privacy thresholds higher per Riverside values
    And residents deliberate messily and democratically
    And residents vote 68% to continue with proposed calibrations
    And democratic process works through disagreement toward flourishing

  Scenario: Respond to resident appeal pattern requiring community action
    Given Constitutional Council shows pattern of adolescent autonomy appeals
    And multiple families report agents being overly restrictive
    When Jamal reviews the pattern with city council
    Then Jamal initiates community dialogue about appropriate thresholds
    And Jamal facilitates deliberative assembly with families and youth
    And community develops shared understanding of growth versus safety
    And community proposes calibration specific to Riverside culture
    And Constitutional Council authorizes local calibration
    And protocol adapts to reflect community democratic will

  Scenario: Mediate deadlock between community agents
    Given Community Economic Elohim supports business development project
    And Community Environmental Elohim opposes due to watershed impact
    When the agents cannot reach consensus
    Then Jamal convenes Deliberative Assembly as mediator
    And Jamal brings farmers, downstream communities, and scientists together
    And Jamal facilitates Polis-style dialogue finding common ground
    And assembly develops phased solution satisfying both agents
    And Jamal implements assembly decision
    And community demonstrates human wisdom resolves what agents cannot alone

  Scenario: Advocate for community-specific constitutional interpretation
    Given Riverside has indigenous heritage with river-centered spirituality
    And global ecological standing amendment passed
    When Riverside interprets amendment locally
    Then Jamal works with community to recognize river as legal person
    And indigenous guardians are appointed alongside Ecosystem Elohim
    And local cultural values shape constitutional application
    And protocol allows this specification within constitutional bounds
    And Riverside maintains its identity while participating in global system

  Scenario: Ensure accessibility for elderly and marginalized residents
    Given Riverside has aging population with limited tech literacy
    And some residents lack internet or smartphones
    When Jamal implements protocol
    Then human service windows remain open for in-person assistance
    And paper-based appeal forms are available
    And continuous education programs run for all age groups
    And childcare is provided for Constitutional Council service
    And protocol is designed to include everyone not just tech-savvy
    And no resident is excluded due to barriers

  Scenario: Coordinate community funding for protocol infrastructure
    Given Riverside needs to fund community nodes and maintenance
    When Jamal develops funding strategy
    Then municipal budget allocates funds treating protocol as public infrastructure
    And community ownership cooperative allows resident investment
    And ValueFlow care tokens contribute to infrastructure sustainability
    And state and federal grants supplement local funding
    And community retains ownership despite diverse funding sources
    And democratic control is preserved

  Scenario: Build trust incrementally in community with historical betrayal
    Given Riverside was forcibly displaced in 1950s
    And residents experienced environmental contamination and police violence
    When Jamal introduces Elohim Protocol
    Then he acknowledges trust must be earned incrementally
    And he ensures sortition-selected councils are neighbors not distant officials
    And he provides multiple examples of safe failure with recourse
    And he maintains transparency about what's working and what's failing
    And trust builds slowly through demonstrated care and accountability
    And protocol earns legitimacy through outcomes not promises

  Scenario: Connect with other community leaders for peer learning
    Given Jamal is implementing protocol in Riverside
    When Jamal encounters implementation challenges
    Then he consults network of other mayors and civic leaders
    And peers share how they funded community nodes
    And peers troubleshoot when agent conflicts with local ordinance
    And peers collectively advocate for accessibility improvements
    And community-to-community learning accelerates adoption
    And no community reinvents solutions alone

  Scenario: Provide community context to Constitutional Council
    Given Riverside Constitutional Council reviews local appeal
    And council members need understanding of neighborhood history
    When Jamal is invited as context provider
    Then he explains neighborhood has history of police violence
    And he clarifies why surveillance concerns are especially salient
    And he provides cultural background for constitutional interpretation
    And he respects council's authority while informing their judgment
    And local knowledge improves decision quality

  Scenario: Prepare for authoritarian resistance if needed
    Given state government might become hostile to protocol
    When Jamal plans for protocol resilience
    Then he ensures encrypted backups exist
    And he establishes mesh networking for disruption scenarios
    And he partners with sanctuary institutions holding backup data
    And he prepares civil disobedience protocols
    And community sovereignty is protected even under pressure
    And democratic AI governance cannot be easily eliminated
