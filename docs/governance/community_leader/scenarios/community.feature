Feature: Community-Level Governance Integration for Community Leader
  As a community_leader in the governance system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to integrate Elohim Protocol with existing democratic structures
  So that AI governance serves community flourishing while respecting local sovereignty

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the community_leader user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active
    And Mayor Jamal Washington leads Riverside (population 45,000)

  Scenario: Adopting Elohim Protocol through community referendum
    Given Riverside is considering protocol adoption
    And I am responsible for democratic decision-making process
    When we conduct community deliberation and vote
    Then we provide: 6 months of education and pilot testing
    And we ensure: residents understand what they're choosing
    And we hold: town halls, demonstrations, Q&A sessions
    And we offer: transparent information about benefits and risks
    And we conduct: referendum with 65% approval threshold
    And we respect: community sovereignty to accept or reject
    And adoption becomes: democratic mandate not top-down imposition
    And I am accountable: for implementation serving community values

  Scenario: Mediating between community members and agents
    Given Community Elohim makes decisions affecting Riverside residents
    And some residents don't understand or disagree with decisions
    When I serve as bridge between residents and agent governance
    Then I explain: how protocol works in accessible language
    And I facilitate: residents filing appeals when appropriate
    And I provide: context to Constitutional Council about local culture
    And I advocate: for residents when agents miss local knowledge
    And I maintain: boundary where I don't control agents but collaborate
    And I enable: democratic participation in AI governance
    And I am accountable: to residents through elections

  Scenario: Providing local context to Constitutional Council deliberations
    Given community council is reviewing appeal requiring local knowledge
    And I have information about Riverside history and circumstances
    When I testify to provide community context
    Then I explain: relevant history, cultural factors, relationships
    And I clarify: why something might seem unusual to outsiders
    And I don't advocate: for particular outcome in appeal
    And I inform: council's judgment with local wisdom
    And I respect: council's independence and authority
    And I enable: constitutional interpretation grounded in reality
    And community knowledge: enriches democratic governance

  Scenario: Identifying patterns in appeals informing local policy
    Given Constitutional Council has reviewed many Riverside appeals
    And I observe recurring themes and tensions
    When I analyze patterns for community improvement
    Then I see: many adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging
    And I notice: recurring privacy threshold concerns
    And I identify: business loan criteria creating frustration
    And I bring: patterns to city council for policy response
    And we consider: community-specific protocol calibration
    And we propose: local ordinance updates if needed
    And appeals inform: democratic policy making
    And feedback loop: connects individual recourse to systemic improvement

  Scenario: Calibrating protocol to community-specific values
    Given Riverside has distinct cultural values and history
    And we want protocol to reflect our community identity
    When we engage in community calibration process
    Then we deliberate: about privacy thresholds (we value privacy highly)
    And we discuss: resource sharing norms (indigenous heritage influences us)
    And we consider: how our history affects trust (government betrayal in past)
    And we vote: on calibrations within constitutional bounds
    And we implement: community-specific settings
    And protocol respects: local sovereignty and cultural specificity
    And we exercise: meaningful self-governance within shared principles

  Scenario: Integrating protocol with existing city governance
    Given city council still passes ordinances and makes policy
    And Elohim Protocol augments rather than replaces government
    When I coordinate protocol with traditional civic structures
    Then Community Elohim: provides information for council decisions
    And city council: maintains authority over policy
    And planning commission: still reviews developments (with agent input)
    And existing institutions: work alongside protocol
    And I clarify: boundaries and responsibilities
    And we avoid: conflicts between agent decisions and local law
    And integration strengthens: both democratic governance and AI support

  Scenario: Addressing implementation challenges pragmatically
    Given Riverside faces practical problems with protocol
    And elderly residents struggle with technology
    When I work to solve accessibility issues
    Then we maintain: human service windows for tech-reluctant residents
    And we offer: paper-based alternatives to digital interfaces
    And we run: continuous education programs
    And we provide: in-person support and assistance
    And we ensure: no resident excluded due to tech barriers
    And we adapt: implementation to community reality
    And protocol serves: everyone not just tech-savvy

  Scenario: Funding community protocol infrastructure sustainably
    Given Riverside needs resources for community nodes and maintenance
    And we are relatively poor community
    When I cobble together funding from multiple sources
    Then we allocate: municipal budget treating this as public infrastructure
    And we create: community ownership cooperative with resident investment
    And we apply: for state and federal grants
    And we participate: in mutual aid with wealthier communities
    And we ensure: community retains ownership
    And we plan: for 10-year sustainability not just pilot
    And public investment: supports democratic governance tools

  Scenario: Demonstrating visible community benefit for reelection
    Given I face reelection and need to show protocol serves Riverside
    And residents judge me on outcomes not philosophy
    When I present annual protocol review to community
    Then I show: data on wellbeing improvements (loneliness down, satisfaction up)
    And I report: crisis response effectiveness and economic resilience
    And I acknowledge: failures and challenges honestly
    And I demonstrate: transparent accountability
    And I propose: continuing with recommended calibrations
    And residents vote: 68% to continue (not consensus but democratic)
    And I remain accountable: through normal democratic processes
    And evidence matters: for sustaining political support

  Scenario: Convening deliberative assembly for community conflict
    Given watershed decision deadlocked agents (agricultural vs ecological)
    And multi-community coordination is needed
    When I convene deliberative assembly with affected communities
    Then we bring together: upstream and downstream stakeholders
    And we facilitate: structured deliberation about shared resources
    And we explore: synthesis honoring multiple values
    And we enable: democratic resolution of agent conflicts
    And we reach: agreement on graduated resource sharing
    And deliberative democracy: resolves what algorithms couldn't
    And I demonstrate: leadership as facilitation not command

  Scenario: Protecting protocol sovereignty from state overreach
    Given state government attempts regulation compromising protocol
    And I believe this violates community sovereignty
    When I advocate for protecting local autonomy
    Then I testify: at state legislative hearings
    And I coalition: with other community leaders
    And I present: evidence that regulation would harm local governance
    And I defend: subsidiarity principle and community choice
    And I resist: one-size-fits-all mandates from higher layers
    And I maintain: that communities adopted protocol voluntarily
    And I protect: democratic self-governance

  Scenario: Sharing implementation wisdom with other community leaders
    Given I have three years experience implementing protocol in Riverside
    And other mayors considering adoption seek my advice
    When I share honest assessment of benefits and challenges
    Then I describe: what worked (community calibration, Constitutional Council)
    And I acknowledge: what struggled (elderly accessibility, some controversy)
    And I explain: factors predicting success (community buy-in, resources, patience)
    And I provide: practical implementation guidance
    And I offer: not utopia but better than what we had
    And I emphasize: communities control adoption speed and approach
    And peer network: enables learning across communities

  Scenario: Planning for crisis response maintaining democratic oversight
    Given emergencies require rapid coordination
    And I must balance speed with democratic legitimacy
    When I establish crisis response protocols
    Then Community Elohim: helps coordinate response rapidly
    And I maintain: human judgment for crisis decisions
    And Constitutional Council: provides oversight even under urgency
    And emergency powers: have clear limits and sunset provisions
    And we preserve: democratic accountability during crisis
    And we plan: for resilience without sacrificing governance principles
    And we demonstrate: democracy can be both deliberative and responsive

  Scenario: Preparing community for potential authoritarian resistance
    Given authoritarian threat to protocol might emerge
    And I plan for protecting community sovereignty
    When I establish contingency plans for resistance
    Then we maintain: encrypted backups of community data
    And we prepare: mesh networking for internet disruption
    And we identify: sanctuary partners (university, churches)
    And we plan: civil disobedience protocols if needed
    And we retain: community fork option as last resort
    And we hope: never to use these
    And we know: community sovereignty matters more than protocol uniformity
