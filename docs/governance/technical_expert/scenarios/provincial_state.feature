Feature: Provincial/State Governance for Technical Expert
  As a technical_expert in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer
  I want to provide expert testimony and audit agent reasoning
  So that Constitutional Councils can evaluate complex technical questions

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational across the region
    And Dr. Amara Okonkwo is cryptographer serving as rotating technical expert
    And the provincial_state governance context is active
    And Amara has been assigned 4-month term advising regional councils
    And Amara's testimony is public and subject to peer review

  Scenario: Testify to regional Constitutional Council on complex agent reasoning
    Given Sarah Martinez's regional council reviews multi-agent coordination case
    And the constitutional question requires understanding technical complexity
    When Amara is called to provide expert testimony
    Then she explains in plain language how agents reached consensus
    And she uses analogies accessible to high school education level
    And she presents cryptographic proof that decision traced to constitutional principles
    And she acknowledges uncertainty about whether reasoning was optimal
    And she welcomes Sarah's questions from nursing perspective
    And she informs judgment without dominating it

  Scenario: Explain cryptographic constitutional verification to non-technical council
    Given council needs to understand whether agent followed protocol
    And cryptographic proofs are technically complex
    When Amara explains verification mechanism
    Then she uses analogy of locked box showing answer without revealing secret
    And she explains what proof demonstrates and what it cannot prove
    And she acknowledges where analogy breaks down
    And she provides multiple explanations until council members understand
    And she makes technical truth accessible without oversimplification

  Scenario: Audit agent decision for technical errors or vulnerabilities
    Given appeal claims agent made decision based on corrupted data
    When Amara conducts technical audit
    Then she examines agent decision logs and data sources
    And she traces reasoning chain from input to output
    And she verifies cryptographic proof integrity
    And she identifies technical error (address verification failure like Wisconsin case)
    And she testifies honestly that agent made technical mistake
    And her audit strengthens appellant's case

  Scenario: Present competing technical interpretations fairly
    Given technical experts disagree on whether transparency method is sufficient
    And Dr. Chen believes method is adequate while Amara sees vulnerabilities
    When Amara testifies to council
    Then she presents both her view and Dr. Chen's view
    And she explains where they agree and where they disagree
    And she clarifies the technical basis for each interpretation
    And she does not claim false consensus
    And council sees intellectual diversity among experts
    And council judges which interpretation is more constitutionally aligned

  Scenario: Acknowledge limits of technical understanding
    Given agent reasoning involves patterns approaching human comprehension limits
    When Amara explains what she can and cannot verify
    Then she states "I can verify cryptographic proof shows constitutional alignment"
    And she admits "I cannot fully explain the reasoning chain itself"
    And she honestly says this is beyond current human comprehension
    And she does not pretend to explain what she cannot understand
    And her humility is crucial for democratic legitimacy

  Scenario: Translate technical tradeoffs without making value judgments
    Given council debates whether to require stronger encryption
    When Amara explains technical implications
    Then she states "stronger encryption improves privacy but slows decisions by 15%"
    And she clarifies "this is technical tradeoff, not value judgment"
    And she does not say whether privacy or speed is more important
    And she respects that council decides values while she clarifies constraints
    And expertise serves democracy rather than replacing it

  Scenario: Disclose conflicts of interest before testifying
    Given Amara previously consulted for company that builds protocol tools
    When she is called to testify on case involving that company
    Then she publicly discloses her prior consulting relationship
    And she explains potential bias this creates
    And she offers to recuse herself if council prefers
    And council appreciates her transparency and allows her to proceed
    And disclosure maintains trust in expert testimony

  Scenario: Identify systematic technical issue requiring protocol update
    Given Amara audits multiple regional cases
    And she discovers recurring verification vulnerability
    When she reports the systematic issue
    Then she documents the vulnerability with technical precision
    And she proposes potential solutions with tradeoffs
    And she reports to Protocol Research Council for review
    And she briefs Constitutional Councils on implications
    And her technical vigilance protects protocol integrity

  Scenario: Work with policy maker to evaluate proposed regulation
    Given Senator Ruiz considers legislation requiring agent explainability standards
    When Amara is consulted on technical feasibility
    Then she explains what explainability is technically possible
    And she clarifies what would compromise constitutional verification
    And she does not advocate for or against the policy
    And she provides technical truth for Elena to make policy judgment
    And expert-policymaker relationship serves democratic governance

  Scenario: Collaborate with peer experts on technical standard development
    Given protocol needs updated cryptographic methods
    When Amara participates in expert working group
    Then she collaborates with other cryptographers on new standards
    And they conduct peer review of each other's proposals
    And they test proposals adversarially to find vulnerabilities
    And they submit recommendations to Protocol Research Council
    And expert community provides checks and balances

  Scenario: Respect council decision even when technically suboptimal
    Given Sarah's council rules privacy concerns outweigh risk prevention
    And Amara believes this will cause preventable suffering
    When council issues its determination
    Then Amara documents her technical dissent respectfully
    And she accepts council's democratic authority to choose values over optimization
    And she does not show contempt for citizen judgment
    And she recognizes democracy sometimes chooses differently than experts would
    And this is not failure but democratic choice

  Scenario: Complete 4-month term rotation to prevent expert capture
    Given Amara has served her full regional advisory term
    When her term ends
    Then she returns to her primary research work
    And she cannot serve consecutive terms
    And another expert from the pool rotates in
    And her testimony is documented for future reference
    And rotation prevents her from becoming indispensable or captured
    And fresh expert perspectives continue serving councils
