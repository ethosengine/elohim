Feature: Global Governance for Technical Expert
  As a technical_expert in the governance system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want to address existential technical questions and inform constitutional conventions
  So that humanity can govern superintelligent AI with technical integrity

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational in 60 countries globally
    And Dr. Amara Okonkwo serves on Global Protocol Research Council
    And the global governance context addresses existential questions
    And Amara is among international experts advising First Global Constitutional Convention
    And 10,000 randomly-selected citizens are deliberating humanity's AI governance

  Scenario: Testify at Global Constitutional Convention on superintelligence governance
    Given convention debates whether democracy can oversee what it cannot understand
    And this is existential question for human-AI partnership
    When Amara testifies to 10,000 global delegates
    Then she explains what "superintelligence" actually means technically
    And she clarifies when agents might exceed human comprehension
    And she presents technical mechanisms for preserving constitutional alignment
    And she honestly states "we don't know if this is sufficient"
    And she acknowledges profound uncertainty about the future
    And she informs delegates while respecting their authority to choose

  Scenario: Explain concept of "constitutional alignment we cannot understand"
    Given agents approach capabilities beyond human reasoning
    And delegates ask whether cryptographic verification is enough
    When Amara addresses the core tension
    Then she states "I can verify proof shows constitutional alignment"
    And she admits "I cannot explain or evaluate the reasoning itself"
    And she asks "can we trust what we cannot comprehend?"
    And she does not claim to have the answer
    And she clarifies this is philosophical question as much as technical
    And her honest uncertainty serves democratic deliberation

  Scenario: Propose "explain-down" capability requirement for superintelligent agents
    Given agents becoming incomprehensible threatens democratic legitimacy
    When Amara proposes technical solution
    Then she suggests requiring agents to explain reasoning at human comprehension level
    And she acknowledges this constrains what agents can do
    And she presents tradeoff between capability and democratic oversight
    And she works with other experts to develop implementation approach
    And she submits proposal to Protocol Research Council
    And convention delegates ultimately decide whether to adopt

  Scenario: Participate in Protocol Research Council reviewing global standards
    Given protocol operates across 60 countries with different contexts
    And global standards must enable local sovereignty while ensuring minimums
    When Amara serves on research council
    Then she reviews proposed protocol updates from global perspective
    And she ensures cryptographic methods work across cultural contexts
    And she tests for vulnerabilities at global scale
    And she collaborates with international expert peers
    And she respects that Constitutional Councils authorize changes not experts

  Scenario: Respond to international attempt to compromise protocol
    Given authoritarian government attempts to infiltrate and corrupt protocol
    And attack targets cryptographic verification at global scale
    When Amara participates in global security response
    Then she works with international experts to assess the threat
    And she develops countermeasures with peer review
    And she briefs Constitutional Councils across countries
    And she maintains transparency about vulnerability without enabling further attacks
    And global expert community defends protocol integrity

  Scenario: Address tension between technical optimization and democratic values
    Given delegates debate whether perfect efficiency justifies reduced oversight
    When Amara is asked whether this is technically necessary
    Then she states "optimal efficiency requires autonomy from oversight"
    And she clarifies "but optimization is not constitutional value"
    And she explains "you can choose oversight over efficiency"
    And she presents technical tradeoffs without advocating choice
    And she respects that democracy chooses values not optimization
    And technical expertise serves human flourishing not technical perfection

  Scenario: Collaborate on international cryptographic standards for AI governance
    Given different nations use different cryptographic approaches
    And interoperability requires some harmonization
    When Amara participates in international standards development
    Then she works with cryptographers from diverse countries
    And they develop standards that are culturally neutral
    And they ensure standards preserve national and community sovereignty
    And they submit recommendations to international governance forum
    And they recognize standards must serve democracy not technical elegance

  Scenario: Testify on existential risk from advanced AI capabilities
    Given some capabilities could pose catastrophic risks
    When convention debates whether to limit certain agent capabilities
    Then Amara explains what capabilities create existential risks
    And she clarifies uncertainty about risk levels
    And she presents competing expert views on risk assessment
    And she does not claim certainty where uncertainty exists
    And she acknowledges reasonable experts disagree
    And she provides technical information for values judgment by delegates

  Scenario: Explain quantum computing implications for global protocol
    Given quantum computers will break current cryptographic methods
    And this threatens constitutional verification worldwide
    When Amara addresses quantum threat at global level
    Then she explains timeline for quantum capability emergence
    And she presents quantum-resistant cryptographic alternatives
    And she proposes global transition strategy with implementation plan
    And she coordinates with international technical community
    And she ensures democratic authorization for transition
    And technical planning serves long-term protocol sustainability

  Scenario: Work with researcher Chen on global AI alignment evaluation
    Given Dr. James Chen studies whether sortition can oversee superintelligence
    When Amara collaborates on technical assessment
    Then she provides technical metrics for alignment verification
    And she explains limits of current verification methods
    And she identifies concerning trends in expert deference
    And she contributes technical perspective to research
    And expert-researcher collaboration informs existential governance questions

  Scenario: Resist corporate pressure to weaken global cryptographic standards
    Given multinational corporations lobby for "flexible" security standards
    And flexibility would enable corporate surveillance and control
    When Amara encounters this capture attempt
    Then she exposes the lobbying publicly in international forums
    And she explains how proposed standards would compromise protocol
    And she mobilizes international expert community in opposition
    And she maintains technical integrity despite corporate pressure
    And democratic protocol governance resists corporate capture globally

  Scenario: Acknowledge the burden of influence on humanity's future
    Given Amara's technical testimony shapes global constitutional choices
    And these choices affect billions of people for generations
    When she reflects on the responsibility
    Then she feels the weight of influencing humanity's trajectory
    And she knows she might be wrong about technical assessments
    And she remains humble about the limits of expertise
    And she trusts democratic process despite her uncertainty
    And she acts with integrity knowing the stakes are existential
    And she contributes her expertise while respecting democratic authority

  Scenario: Complete global advisory term and return to research
    Given Amara has served 6-month term on Global Protocol Research Council
    When her term ends
    Then she returns to her cryptography research at university
    And she cannot serve consecutive global terms
    And another international expert rotates into position
    And her contributions are archived for future reference
    And rotation ensures no permanent technical priesthood at global level
    And humanity governs superintelligent AI with democratic legitimacy
