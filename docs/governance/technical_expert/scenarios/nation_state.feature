Feature: National Governance for Technical Expert
  As a technical_expert in the governance system
  Operating at the nation_state governance layer
  I want to advise on national technical standards and constitutional verification
  So that democratic governance maintains technical integrity at national scale

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational nationwide
    And Dr. Amara Okonkwo serves on National Technical Advisory Council
    And the nation_state governance context is active
    And Amara has been selected for 6-month rotating term
    And she advises on national technical standards and security

  Scenario: Testify to Senate Committee on cryptographic backdoor proposal
    Given technology companies and security agencies propose mandatory backdoors
    And Senator Ruiz leads committee evaluating the proposal
    When Amara testifies as technical expert
    Then she explains that backdoors break constitutional verification cryptographically
    And she clarifies this is not political opinion but mathematical reality
    And she demonstrates how backdoors enable capture by any actor with access
    And she presents technical alternatives for legitimate security needs
    And she provides truth-telling that enables democratic policy choice
    And her testimony defeats backdoor mandate

  Scenario: Advise national Constitutional Council on superintelligent agent reasoning
    Given appeal involves agent decision using reasoning beyond human comprehension
    And national council must determine constitutional alignment
    When Amara testifies to council
    Then she explains agent capability has exceeded normal understanding
    And she presents cryptographic proof that constitutional alignment was verified
    And she honestly admits "I cannot explain the reasoning chain itself"
    And she acknowledges this creates profound governance challenge
    And she does not pretend to understand what she cannot grasp
    And her humility about limits is crucial for democratic legitimacy

  Scenario: Develop national technical standards for constitutional verification
    Given protocol operates at massive scale nationwide
    And verification methods must be consistent and secure
    When Amara participates in national standards development
    Then she collaborates with other cryptographers on updated methods
    And they design standards that are cryptographically sound
    And they ensure standards preserve community sovereignty
    And they test standards adversarially for vulnerabilities
    And they submit to Protocol Research Council for review
    And national Constitutional Council authorizes the standards

  Scenario: Respond to zero-day cryptographic vulnerability discovery
    Given critical security vulnerability is discovered in verification system
    And protocol integrity is compromised nationwide
    When Amara participates in emergency technical response
    Then she verifies the vulnerability with other experts
    And she develops mitigation patch with peer review
    And she briefs Constitutional Councils on emergency protocol change
    And she explains technical necessity and risks honestly
    And she supports democratic authorization despite urgency
    And technical emergency response maintains democratic legitimacy

  Scenario: Evaluate whether quantum computing requires protocol redesign
    Given quantum computers threaten current cryptographic methods
    When Amara assesses quantum computing implications for protocol
    Then she explains what cryptographic methods are quantum-vulnerable
    And she proposes quantum-resistant alternatives with tradeoffs
    And she estimates timeline before quantum threatens protocol
    And she recommends proactive transition to quantum-resistant methods
    And she informs national strategic planning with technical expertise

  Scenario: Explain technical constraints to policy makers drafting legislation
    Given Senator Ruiz drafts Federal Digital Dignity Act
    And legislation includes technical requirements for agents
    When Amara reviews proposed technical mandates
    Then she clarifies what is technically feasible vs impossible
    And she explains tradeoffs of different technical approaches
    And she identifies where proposed mandates would compromise protocol
    And she suggests alternative language achieving policy goals
    And she serves policy making without dominating values choices

  Scenario: Address tension between perfect explainability and agent capability
    Given national council debates requiring perfect transparency
    And technical reality is that capability and explainability trade off
    When Amara explains the technical constraint
    Then she states "perfect explainability may limit agent capability"
    And she clarifies "this is technical reality not value judgment"
    And she presents the tradeoff spectrum with concrete examples
    And she does not advocate for particular choice
    And she respects council's authority to choose values over optimization
    And technical truth serves democratic deliberation

  Scenario: Participate in Protocol Research Council reviewing national updates
    Given developers propose Agent Protocol v3.0 with significant changes
    When Amara serves on research council evaluating update
    Then she conducts adversarial testing trying to break new features
    And she verifies cryptographic proofs for constitutional alignment
    And she examines whether update introduces new vulnerabilities
    And she collaborates with peer experts on comprehensive review
    And she recommends approval only after rigorous evaluation
    And research council serves as technical quality control

  Scenario: Work with researcher to translate findings into technical improvements
    Given Dr. James Chen finds systematic bias in agent decisions
    When Amara collaborates to address technical root cause
    Then she examines whether bias is in data, algorithm, or calibration
    And she proposes technical modifications to reduce bias
    And she works with affected communities to validate solutions
    And she implements fixes that preserve constitutional alignment
    And expert-researcher collaboration serves justice

  Scenario: Testify about AI alignment limitations to Constitutional Convention
    Given delegates debate superintelligence governance at convention
    When Amara addresses the existential question
    Then she explains "we have not solved alignment for superintelligent AI"
    And she clarifies "no one has, this is unsolved technical problem"
    And she presents current best methods and their limitations
    And she acknowledges profound uncertainty about future
    And she does not provide false reassurance
    And her honest assessment of what we don't know is crucial

  Scenario: Navigate attempted corruption by corporate interests
    Given technology company offers Amara lucrative position
    And offer appears contingent on favorable testimony
    When Amara recognizes capture attempt
    Then she declines the offer and reports it publicly
    And she discloses attempted influence in future testimony
    And she maintains independence despite financial pressure
    And whistleblower protections support her integrity
    And her resistance to capture preserves expert credibility

  Scenario: Complete 6-month national advisory term
    Given Amara has served full term on national technical council
    When her term ends
    Then she returns to her cryptography research
    And she cannot serve consecutive terms at national level
    And another expert rotates into the position
    And her contributions are documented in technical archive
    And rotation prevents permanent technical priesthood
    And democratic governance maintains technical expertise without technocracy
