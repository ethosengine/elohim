# Elohim Protocol - Governance Layers

This directory contains the complete governance layer architecture for the Elohim Protocol, spanning from individual to global scales across both geographic/political and functional dimensions.

## Architecture Overview

The Elohim Protocol operates through a sophisticated multi-layered constitutional architecture, where immutability exists on a gradient and Elohim agents act as constitutional negotiators across scales.

## Directory Structure

### Geographic/Political Layers

These layers follow traditional geographic and political boundaries, from the most intimate (individual) to the most universal (global):

1. **individual/** - Personal values, choices, and maximum autonomy within constitutional limits
2. **family/** - Household values, traditions, and private governance structures
3. **neighborhood/** - Block/street level coordination and community building
4. **community/** - Local group norms, practices, and community values
5. **district/** - Multi-neighborhood coordination (school districts, etc.)
6. **municipality/** - City/town level governance and urban coordination
7. **county_regional/** - Sub-national regional governance and planning
8. **provincial_state/** - State/provincial constitutional interpretation and policy
9. **nation_state/** - National governance, federal legislation, and administration
10. **continental/** - Regional blocs (EU, ASEAN, etc.) and multi-national coordination
11. **global/** - Universal principles, existential boundaries, and planetary coordination

### Functional Layers

These layers operate in parallel to geographic layers, organized around specific domains of human activity:

1. **workplace_organizational/** - Business entities, cooperatives, and workplace governance
2. **educational/** - Schools, universities, and educational policy across all scales
3. **ecological_bioregional/** - Watershed management, ecosystem representation, and bioregional stewardship
4. **cultural_linguistic/** - Cultural communities, language preservation, and tradition keeping
5. **industry_sector/** - Professional domains, supply chains, and industry standards
6. **affinity_network/** - Interest-based communities and distributed networks

## Constitutional Immutability Gradient

The system operates on a **gradient of immutability** from most flexible (individual) to most immutable (global):

- **GLOBAL LAYER** (Most Immutable) - Requires Elohim consensus across all scales
  - Universal principles: "Love as committed action toward flourishing"
  - Existential boundaries: "No extinction, no genocide, no slavery"
  - Core definitions that cannot be corrupted by any human institution

- **NATION-STATE LAYER** - Requires National Elohim + citizen consensus
  - Constitutional interpretations of global principles
  - Cultural expressions of universal values
  - Sovereign within global bounds

- **PROVINCIAL/MUNICIPAL LAYER** - Requires Local Elohim + community consensus
  - Local policy implementations
  - Regional cultural adaptations
  - Contextual applications of higher principles

- **COMMUNITY LAYER** - Requires Community Elohim + member consensus
  - Group norms and practices
  - Specific community values
  - Local governance within constitutional bounds

- **FAMILY LAYER** - Requires Family Elohim + family consensus
  - Household values and traditions
  - Personal interpretations
  - Private governance structures

- **INDIVIDUAL LAYER** (Most Flexible) - Sovereign within all higher bounds
  - Personal values and choices
  - Individual expression
  - Maximum autonomy within constitutional limits

## Key Principles

### 1. Subsidiarity
Maximum local autonomy within constitutional bounds. Decisions made at the lowest appropriate layer.

### 2. Nested Sovereignty
Each layer is sovereign within its domain, subject only to constitutional constraints from higher layers.

### 3. Cross-Layer Verification
Elohim agents at different layers verify each other's constitutional compliance.

### 4. Graduated Consensus
Changes require increasingly difficult consensus as you move up layers. Global changes require consensus among the Elohim themselves.

### 5. Signal Propagation
- **Upward**: Local wisdom informing global understanding
- **Downward**: Universal principles translated into local context
- **Inter-Layer**: Mediating between scales while maintaining coherence

## User Categories

Each layer contains user directories representing the stakeholders and participants at that scale:

- **Citizens/Members**: Those who participate in governance at each layer
- **Administrators**: Those who implement decisions and manage operations
- **Representatives**: Elected or selected officials at various scales
- **Elohim Agents**: AI guardians operating at each constitutional layer
- **Specialized Roles**: Layer-specific roles (watershed guardians, tradition keepers, etc.)

## Constitutional Councils

Each layer (from community to global) has Constitutional Councils selected via cryptographic sortition:

- **Community Layer**: 3-month terms
- **Regional Layer**: 4-month terms
- **National/Global Layer**: 6-month terms

Council members review edge cases, interpret constitutional alignment, and provide human oversight of Elohim agent decisions.

## Why This Structure Defeats Capture

1. **Values are constitutionally immutable** - Core definitions encoded in blockchain smart contracts at the global layer
2. **P2P networks enforce constitution** - Each Elohim agent must cryptographically prove decisions trace to constitutional values
3. **Graduated consensus requirements** - Changes require increasingly difficult consensus as you move up layers
4. **Cross-scale verification** - Elohim agents at different layers verify each other's constitutional compliance

## Implementation

This directory structure serves as the organizational framework for:

- User personas and stakeholder mapping
- Governance protocol development
- Constitutional interpretation and precedent
- Appeal mechanisms and conflict resolution
- Pattern recognition and wisdom sharing across scales
