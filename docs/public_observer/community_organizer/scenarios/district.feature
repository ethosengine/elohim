Feature: District-Level Education Organizing for Community Organizer
  As a community organizer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the district governance layer
  I want to build parent and student power for education justice
  So that school district decisions prioritize equity and community voice

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the community_organizer user is registered in the system
    And the district governance context is active

  Scenario: Organizer detects opportunity in school board budget priorities
    Given school board will vote on budget reallocation next month
    And proposal shifts resources away from Title I schools
    When the Observer surfaces the organizing opportunity
    Then the organizer sees equity impact analysis by school
    And identifies which parent communities are affected
    And gets breakdown of resource distribution changes
    And receives alert early enough to organize parent response
    And district budget becomes organizing opportunity for equity

  Scenario: Organizer builds cross-school parent coalition for equity
    Given parents at five underfunded schools face similar challenges
    And most parents don't know the pattern is district-wide
    When the organizer uses Observer to document resource inequities
    Then they show per-pupil spending gaps across schools
    And map distribution of enrichment programs and experienced teachers
    And connect parents from different schools around shared interests
    And facilitate coalition demanding equitable resource formula
    And individual school struggles become district equity campaign

  Scenario: Organizer develops parent leaders for school board testimony
    Given a Spanish-speaking parent has never attended school board meeting
    And they want to advocate for dual-language program expansion
    When the organizer supports their leadership development via Observer
    Then the parent receives accessible data on dual-language outcomes
    And gets testimony template in Spanish they can personalize
    And practices with common questions board members might ask
    And sees other parents' successful testimony examples
    And becomes powerful education advocate speaking from lived experience

  Scenario: Organizer coordinates parent-teacher coalition for class size reduction
    Given teachers union supports smaller class sizes
    And parents see crowded classrooms affecting their children
    When the organizer builds coalition using Observer coordination tools
    Then teachers and parents access shared data on class size impacts
    And coordinate testimony combining professional and family perspectives
    And track which board members support class size reduction
    And organize joint mobilization for board meeting
    And teacher expertise combines with parent power for policy change

  Scenario: Organizer tracks accountability for special education commitments
    Given district promised improved special education services
    And the organizer's coalition of parents won the commitment
    When the Observer tracks implementation progress
    Then the organizer monitors hiring of promised support staff
    And sees resource allocation to special education programs
    And receives alerts when implementation lags behind timeline
    And documents wins to show parents their advocacy worked
    And district learns parent organizing demands follow-through
