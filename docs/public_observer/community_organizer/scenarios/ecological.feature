Feature: Environmental Justice Organizing for Community Organizer
  As a community organizer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the ecological functional layer
  I want to build community power to fight environmental racism and demand green investment
  So that environmental burdens and benefits are distributed equitably

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the community_organizer user is registered in the system
    And the ecological governance context is active

  Scenario: Organizer documents environmental justice disparities for campaign
    Given industrial pollution concentrates in low-income neighborhoods of color
    While parks and trees concentrate in wealthy white areas
    When the Observer provides environmental equity data
    Then the organizer sees pollution sources mapped by neighborhood demographics
    And views park access and tree canopy distribution
    And calculates health impact disparities from environmental conditions
    And identifies affected communities for organizing base
    And environmental racism becomes documented and actionable

  Scenario: Organizer mobilizes community against polluting facility permit
    Given a company seeks permit for facility in Black neighborhood
    And already has history of violations
    When the organizer uses Observer to support community opposition
    Then they access company's complete violation and enforcement record
    And see health impacts from similar facilities elsewhere
    And calculate cumulative pollution burden on neighborhood
    And organize residents for powerful testimony at permit hearing
    And environmental organizing prevents new pollution in overburdened community

  Scenario: Organizer builds coalition for climate adaptation investment
    Given low-income neighborhoods face worst climate impacts
    But climate funding flows to wealthy areas
    When the organizer uses Observer to identify alignment
    Then they connect communities facing flooding, heat islands, poor air quality
    And document systematic disinvestment in climate resilience
    And coordinate coalition demanding equitable climate spending
    And facilitate testimony from diverse affected communities
    And climate justice becomes redistributive investment campaign

  Scenario: Organizer creates accessible materials on environmental permit process
    Given residents want to oppose toxic facility
    But permit process is technical and intimidating
    When the organizer requests education materials from Observer
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of permit requirements
    And get templates for submitting public comments
    And see examples of successful community opposition
    And access data residents can cite in testimony
    And complex regulatory process becomes accessible to community

  Scenario: Organizer tracks accountability for green space investment promise
    Given city committed to park improvements in underserved neighborhoods
    And the organizer's coalition won the commitment through campaign
    When the Observer tracks implementation progress
    Then the organizer monitors park renovation timeline and budget
    And receives alerts when spending lags or shifts to other areas
    And documents completion showing community organizing created change
    And has evidence to pressure officials if promises aren't kept
    And environmental justice organizing includes accountability for implementation
