Feature: State Development Policy and Accountability for Developer Interests
  As a developer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer
  I want transparent policy frameworks and accountable lobbying
  So that state policy serves community development not just developer extraction

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the developer_interests user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active

  Scenario: Responsible developer advocates for sensible state housing policy
    Given state housing regulations create barriers to affordable development
    And a responsible developer wants to build more affordable housing
    When the Observer provides state policy navigation and advocacy tools
    Then the developer understands state regulatory framework
    And identifies which regulations genuinely protect community versus serve NIMBYism
    And engages in transparent policy advocacy for streamlined affordable housing approval
    And makes case based on evidence not just developer profit
    And transparent advocacy distinguishes from corrupt lobbying

  Scenario: Developer lobbying relationships become transparent
    Given a developer lobbies state legislature for favorable policy
    And makes campaign donations to key committee members
    When the Observer tracks lobbying and political relationships
    Then constituents see: $250K in donations to housing committee members
    And identify correlation between donations and votes on developer-friendly bills
    And the developer faces accountability for political influence
    And legislators face scrutiny about who they serve
    And transparent relationships create pressure for merit-based policy

  Scenario: Developer subsidy accountability reveals actual outcomes
    Given a developer received $10M state tax credit for "affordable housing"
    And claimed it would produce 200 affordable units
    When the Observer tracks subsidy outcomes
    Then analysis shows: only 35 units meet affordability criteria
    And most units are market-rate generating developer profit
    And state subsidy mostly subsidized luxury development
    And taxpayers see poor return on public investment
    And accountability creates pressure for subsidy reform

  Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates subsidy effectiveness
    Given a responsible developer builds genuinely affordable housing
    And uses state subsidies to serve low-income residents
    When the Observer tracks development outcomes against state investment
    Then analysis shows: 180 units meet affordability criteria from $8M subsidy
    And residents are actually low-income workforce families
    And units remain affordable through long-term deed restrictions
    And state investment created genuine community benefit
    And responsible development gains advantage in subsidy allocation

  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for state policy capture
    Given a developer lobbies for state law preempting local control
    And funds astroturf "affordability advocacy" groups
    When the Observer reveals developer funding and advocacy patterns
    Then citizens see: "housing advocates" are developer-funded front groups
    And state preemption bill eliminates local affordable housing requirements
    And policy serves developer profit not affordable housing
    And manufactured grassroots campaigns face exposure
    And policy debate gains transparency about real interests

  Scenario: Developer environmental compliance becomes state accountability issue
    Given a developer's projects consistently violate state environmental standards
    But receives minimal enforcement from state regulators
    When the Observer documents violation patterns and regulatory response
    Then analysis shows: 67 violations across 8 projects over 5 years
    And penalties total $180K while profits exceed $40M
    And state regulators approve new permits despite violation history
    And regulatory capture becomes statistically undeniable
    And developer faces pressure for genuine environmental compliance

  Scenario: State development policy outcomes versus promises
    Given state legislature passed developer-backed "affordable housing" law
    And promised it would increase affordable housing supply
    When the Observer tracks actual outcomes three years later
    Then analysis shows: luxury housing increased 40%
    And affordable housing decreased 8%
    And displacement accelerated in gentrifying neighborhoods
    And policy delivered opposite of promised outcomes
    And evidence supports policy reform not developer rhetoric
