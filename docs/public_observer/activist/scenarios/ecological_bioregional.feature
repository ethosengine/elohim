Feature: Environmental Justice Advocacy for Activist
  As an activist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the ecological_bioregional governance layer
  I want to fight pollution and demand environmental justice
  So that communities of color and low-income neighborhoods get environmental protection

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the ecological_bioregional governance context is active

  Scenario: Activist documents industrial pollution concentration pattern
    Given the activist works on environmental justice
    And suspects systematic pollution burden on communities of color
    When the Observer maps pollution sources and demographics
    Then the activist sees industrial permits cluster in Black and Latino neighborhoods
    And parks and trees concentrate in white affluent areas
    And asthma hospitalizations correlate with pollution exposure
    And environmental racism pattern becomes statistically undeniable
    And legal and regulatory action gains evidentiary foundation

  Scenario: Activist tracks polluter violations and regulatory failure
    Given a facility near the activist's community violates air quality standards
    And regulatory response seems inadequate
    When the Observer documents violation history
    Then the activist sees 47 violations over three years
    And learns penalties were minimal and ineffective
    And identifies which regulators approved permits despite violations
    And exposes revolving door between industry and enforcement
    And regulatory capture becomes visible and challengeable

  Scenario: Activist opposes new polluting facility with evidence
    Given a company applies for permit to build polluting facility
    And claims it will have minimal environmental impact
    When the Observer analyzes company's environmental track record
    Then the activist shows violations at their other facilities
    And calculates health impacts on nearby residents
    And demonstrates existing pollution burden in target neighborhood
    And organizes affected community for testimony
    And corporate claims meet community evidence

  Scenario: Activist demands community benefits agreement for environmental justice
    Given a development will impact the activist's environmental justice community
    And community has disproportionate environmental burden
    When the Observer documents cumulative environmental harms
    Then the activist presents evidence of existing pollution exposure
    And demands green infrastructure investment as mitigation
    And proposes specific community benefits (parks, tree canopy, remediation)
    And coalition negotiates from position of documented harm
    And development must address environmental justice not just profit

  Scenario: Activist connects local environmental struggle to regional climate justice
    Given the activist fights pollution in their neighborhood
    When the Observer reveals regional climate adaptation patterns
    Then the activist sees climate resilience investments favor wealthy areas
    And flood vulnerability concentrates in communities of color
    And urban heat island effects exacerbate environmental injustice
    And local environmental fight connects to climate justice movement
    And climate policy must address environmental equity
