down 12%)\n    And checks police budget claim against actual spending (misleading framing)\n    And publishes real-time fact-check during speech\n    And rhetoric meets evidence-based accountability immediately\n\n  Scenario: Journalist investigates municipal service delivery disparities\n    Given residents in certain neighborhoods report neglected infrastructure\n    And the journalist suspects systematic discrimination\n    When the Observer analyzes municipal operations by neighborhood\n    Then the journalist sees pothole repairs average 2 days in white areas\n    And same repairs take 47 days in Black neighborhoods\n    And code enforcement targets rental properties in immigrant communities\n    And documents service quality correlating with neighborhood race and income\n    And publishes investigation exposing structural racism in city operations\n\n  Scenario: Journalist tracks city promises to accountability\n    Given city council approved affordable housing plan 3 years ago\n    And the journalist covered initial announcement and then moved on\n    When the Observer alerts on promise implementation timeline\n    Then the journalist investigates and finds only 12% of promised units built\n    And sees budget that was supposed to fund program redirected elsewhere\n    And identifies which council members voted for budget changes\n    And publishes accountability story on broken housing commitments\n    And politicians learn promises will be tracked and verified\n\n  Scenario: Journalist develops whistleblower source on contract fraud\n    Given a city employee witnesses fraudulent contracting\n    And fears retaliation for speaking to press\n    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel\n    Then the whistleblower shares documents through protected system\n    And journalist receives evidence of no-bid contracts to connected firms\n    And investigates without exposing source identity\n    And publishes investigation based on documents and additional reporting\n    And source protection enables accountability journalism\n\n  Scenario: Journalist compares city policies to neighboring municipalities\n    Given city council debates new approach to homelessness\n    And politicians claim no alternatives exist\n    When the Observer provides comparative policy analysis\n    Then the journalist sees 3 nearby cities using housing-first approach\n    And reviews outcome data showing reduced homelessness\n    And finds cost comparison showing housing cheaper than criminalization\n    And interviews officials in cities with successful programs\n    And publishes story presenting evidence-based alternatives\n",
