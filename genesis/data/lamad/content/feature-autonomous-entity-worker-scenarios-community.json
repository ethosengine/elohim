Community Stakeholder Relationships for Worker\n  As a worker in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want meaningful relationships with our community stakeholders\n  So that we serve community needs while protecting worker autonomy\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And ChickenMax #247 operates as community institution, not just business\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And community members invested in the EAE acquisition\n\n  Scenario: Workers implement community meal program responding to local need\n    Given Ms. Johnson mentions isolated seniors need meal program\n    And community stakeholder meeting includes customer input\n    When workers deliberate on community meal program proposal\n    Then workers investigate partnership with senior center\n    And workers analyze costs and benefits of subsidized meals\n    And workers democratically vote to implement senior meal program\n    And workers allocate funding from eliminated franchise fee savings\n    And community_elohim facilitates connection with senior center\n    And 340 community meals are served in first quarter\n\n  Scenario: Workers welcome community stakeholder input while maintaining decision autonomy\n    Given community investors funded the EAE acquisition\n    And investors want input on community benefit priorities\n    When annual community stakeholder meeting occurs\n    Then investors and customers share priorities and concerns\n    And workers listen to community input respectfully\n    And workers deliberate on community suggestions democratically\n    And workers maintain final decision authority on operations\n    And community_elohim ensures investors cannot override worker governance\n    And balanced stakeholder participation serves everyone\n\n  Scenario: Workers build relationship with community through transparent sourcing\n    Given workers source produce from Johnson Farm\n    And community values local food systems and sustainability\n    When workers communicate sourcing practices publicly\n    Then customers learn their food comes from regenerative local farm\n    And community_elohim creates farm-to-table transparency dashboard\n    And customers appreciate supporting local farmer and farm workers\n    And workers invite community to visit Johnson Farm during harvest\n    And community connection deepens through transparent supply chains\n\n  Scenario: Workers address problematic customer behavior democratically\n    Given a customer has harassed DeShawn multiple times\n    And worker safety is constitutionally protected\n    When workers document harassment incidents through witness infrastructure\n    Then workers review harassment pattern democratically\n    And workers vote to ban the customer from ChickenMax\n    And community_elohim ensures decision is fair and documented\n    And community respects worker dignity protections\n    And customer harassment ceases without manager intervention\n\n  Scenario: Workers adapt operations to serve community cultural needs\n    Given neighborhood has significant Latino population\n    And community expresses interest in traditional menu items\n    When workers receive customer feedback through community_elohim\n    Then workers investigate culturally appropriate menu additions\n    And workers consult community members on authentic recipes\n    And workers democratically vote to expand menu with Latino dishes\n    And workers hire bilingual staff to serve community better\n    And business becomes more deeply embedded in community culture\n\n  Scenario: Workers participate in neighborhood economic development planning\n    Given municipality is developing economic revitalization plan\n    And workers represent community institution through democratic ownership\n    When neighborhood planning meetings occur\n    Then Maria attends as ChickenMax worker-owner representative\n    And Maria shares experience of democratic business model\n    And Maria advocates for policies supporting worker ownership\n    And community recognizes workers as stakeholders, not just employees\n    And worker voice shapes community economic development\n\n  Scenario: Workers collaborate with community organizations for mutual benefit\n    Given local youth program needs employment opportunities\n    And ChickenMax needs additional staff during busy periods\n    When workers discuss partnership with youth program\n    Then workers create paid internship program for neighborhood youth\n    And workers provide mentorship and skill development\n    And workers hire successful interns as permanent staff\n    And community_elohim tracks youth development outcomes\n    And community wealth circulates through youth employment\n\n  Scenario: Workers share facility space for community organizing after hours\n    Given ChickenMax dining space sits empty evenings and weekends\n    And community groups need meeting space\n    When community requests use of space for organizing meetings\n    Then workers democratically decide to share space with community groups\n    And workers establish guidelines for community space use\n    And workers charge minimal fee to cover utilities\n    And community groups organize tenants' rights, immigrant support, etc.\n    And business becomes community hub beyond meal service\n\n  Scenario: Workers demonstrate transparency building community trust\n    Given community members want to understand democratic business model\n    And workers value transparency about operations and values\n    When workers publish quarterly community impact report\n    Then report shows wages paid to workers ($72K quarterly)\n    And report documents community programs funded ($3K senior meals)\n    And report shares environmental benefits (1,200 lbs local produce)\n    And report includes challenges and learnings honestly\n    And community_elohim makes report accessible and understandable\n    And transparency builds community trust and support\n\n  Scenario: Workers balance community benefit with business sustainability\n    Given community requests subsidized meals for more low-income residents\n    And workers want to serve community while maintaining living wages\n    When workers analyze financial capacity for expanded subsidies\n    Then workers transparently share financial constraints with community\n    And workers propose sliding scale pricing for community meals\n    And community investors offer additional funding for subsidy program\n    And workers democratically approve expanded program with community support\n    And workplace_elohim ensures business sustainability is maintained\n\n  Scenario: Workers respond to community crisis with mutual aid\n    Given neighborhood experiences crisis (fire, flood, or emergency)\n    And community members need food and gathering space\n    When workers learn of community crisis\n    Then workers immediately open ChickenMax for community support\n    And workers provide free meals to affected community members\n    And workers coordinate with community_elohim for broader support network\n    And workers demonstrate solidarity through material aid\n    And community reciprocates support when workers need it\n\n  Scenario: Workers become recognized community leaders through democratic participation\n    Given Maria has been worker-owner for two years\n    And she participates actively in community institutions\n    When community organizations seek board members\n    Then Maria is invited to serve on neighborhood council\n    And Maria represents both ChickenMax and broader worker interests\n    And Maria's democratic governance experience transfers to civic participation\n    And workers transform from exploited employees to community leaders\n    And democratic workplace becomes training ground for civic democracy\n",
