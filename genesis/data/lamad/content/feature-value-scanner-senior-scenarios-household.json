Household Layer Value Recognition for Senior\n  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want to coordinate household care economy and resource management\n  So that retirement household patterns support both care contributions and personal well-being\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the senior user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret manages a retirement household\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And the household_elohim is coordinating household care economy\n    And Margaret's household income is $32k/year fixed\n\n  Scenario: Household budget management on fixed retirement income\n    Given Margaret's household has fixed income of $32k/year\n    And income cannot be increased through additional employment\n    When the household_elohim manages resource allocation\n    Then it should track all household expenses and patterns\n    And it should optimize spending across categories\n    And it should identify opportunities for cost reduction\n    And it should help Margaret maintain quality of life within constraints\n    And the $150/week grocery budget should be managed carefully\n    And household financial dignity should be preserved\n    And the framing should be resource optimization, not poverty\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating household care economy with spouse\n    Given Margaret shares household with a spouse\n    And both are retired and contributing care labor\n    When the household_elohim tracks care contributions\n    Then it should recognize both partners' care work\n    And it should help distribute household labor equitably\n    And it should track who does what to prevent invisible labor\n    And it should facilitate conversations about fair distribution\n    And both partners should experience valued contributions\n    And equity should be maintained in retirement partnership\n\n  Scenario: Managing household independently as single senior\n    Given Margaret lives alone in her household\n    And she manages all household responsibilities independently\n    When Margaret coordinates household tasks\n    Then her personal_agent should support her independence\n    And all household labor should be visible and valued\n    And the system should help her maintain self-sufficiency\n    And she should feel capable, not isolated\n    And household management should feel manageable\n    And her autonomy should be preserved and celebrated\n\n  Scenario: Meal planning for changing nutritional needs and budget\n    Given Margaret has dietary requirements for diabetes management\n    And she needs to optimize nutrition within $150/week budget\n    When the household_elohim helps plan meals\n    Then it should balance health needs with budget constraints\n    And it should suggest affordable high-protein, high-calcium options\n    And it should plan for one or two people to minimize waste\n    And it should use Margaret's cooking knowledge and preferences\n    And meals should be nutritious, affordable, and satisfying\n    And food should support health without breaking budget\n\n  Scenario: Household resource sharing to extend budget\n    Given Margaret's fixed income requires resource optimization\n    And household expenses can be reduced through sharing\n    When the household_elohim identifies sharing opportunities\n    Then it should connect Margaret to tool libraries\n    And it should facilitate bulk buying cooperatives\n    And it should suggest neighborhood resource sharing\n    And it should help reduce household costs through community\n    And Margaret's budget should stretch further through cooperation\n    And resource sharing should feel like community, not charity\n\n  Scenario: Balancing care contributions with household needs\n    Given Margaret provides extensive care outside her household\n    And household tasks still require attention\n    When the household_elohim monitors Margaret's overall care burden\n    Then it should track time spent on external care commitments\n    And it should ensure household needs aren't neglected\n    And it should flag if Margaret's care burden becomes overwhelming\n    And it should suggest balance between giving and self-care\n    And Margaret's own household should remain a priority\n    And burnout prevention should be built into system\n\n  Scenario: Household downsizing and simplification support\n    Given Margaret is transitioning to retirement household patterns\n    And she may need to simplify or downsize\n    When Margaret considers household changes\n    Then the household_elohim should provide decision support\n    And it should help evaluate different living arrangements\n    And it should calculate cost implications of changes\n    And it should preserve Margaret's autonomy in decisions\n    And practical information should support her choices\n    And the system should help her age in place if she wishes\n\n  Scenario: Household energy and utility cost management\n    Given utilities represent significant portion of fixed income\n    And cost reduction matters for household sustainability\n    When the household_elohim tracks utility usage\n    Then it should help Margaret optimize energy use\n    And it should suggest cost-saving behavioral changes\n    And it should identify assistance programs available to seniors\n    And utility costs should be minimized without sacrificing comfort\n    And Margaret's household should be sustainable on fixed income\n    And dignity should be maintained in resource management\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating household care with external family obligations\n    Given Margaret provides care for grandchildren at her home sometimes\n    And her mother may visit or require household accommodation\n    When the household_elohim coordinates multi-generational care\n    Then it should help Margaret prepare household for care provision\n    And it should track supplies needed for grandchild visits\n    And it should plan for mother's accessibility needs\n    And household resources should flex for care obligations\n    And Margaret's home should support her care contributions\n    And the household should be center of care economy activity\n\n  Scenario: Household safety modifications for aging in place\n    Given Margaret wants to continue living independently\n    And aging may require household modifications\n    When the household_elohim assesses safety needs\n    Then it should identify potential safety hazards\n    And it should suggest affordable modifications\n    And it should connect Margaret to assistance programs\n    And modifications should support long-term independence\n    And Margaret should be able to age safely at home\n    And proactive planning should prevent crisis\n\n  Scenario: Seasonal household adjustments for health and budget\n    Given Margaret's health needs change with seasons\n    And seasonal weather affects household costs\n    When the household_elohim plans for seasonal transitions\n    Then it should help Margaret prepare for winter heating costs\n    And it should suggest summer cooling strategies on budget\n    And it should adjust meal planning for seasonal produce\n    And household should be optimized for each season\n    And Margaret should maintain comfort year-round\n    And seasonal planning should prevent budget crises\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining household dignity and quality despite constraints\n    Given Margaret's household operates on limited resources\n    And she has decades of experience making homes\n    When the household_elohim supports Margaret's household management\n    Then it should honor her expertise and knowledge\n    And it should help her maintain the home she wants\n    And it should preserve household dignity and beauty\n    And financial constraints should not mean deprivation\n    And Margaret's household should reflect her values and taste\n    And quality of life should be supported within resource limits\n",
