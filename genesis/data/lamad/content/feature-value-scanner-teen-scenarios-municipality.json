Municipal Layer Value Recognition for Teen\n  As a teen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the municipal governance layer\n  I want to engage with public systems and local policy as a constitutional participant\n  So that I learn civic engagement and my generation's voice shapes systems for collective flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teen user \"Jasmine\" is registered in the system\n    And Jasmine is 16 years old\n    And she lives in the municipality of Riverside\n    And the municipal governance context is active\n    And the municipal_elohim coordinates city-wide care economy patterns\n    And Jasmine has substantial care contributions across multiple contexts\n\n  Scenario: Teen's care contributions give standing in municipal conversations\n    Given Jasmine has accumulated significant care economy participation\n    And she contributes household labor, paid work, volunteering, and civic engagement\n    When municipal discussions about youth policy occur\n    Then her care contributions should give her legitimate standing\n    And municipal_elohim should recognize her as a constitutional participant\n    And she should not be dismissed due to age\n    And her voice should carry weight based on demonstrated contribution\n    And the municipality should recognize teens as current participants, not future constituents\n    And youth civic engagement should be valued as care work for democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Municipal youth advisory board includes teen care economy participants\n    Given the municipality is establishing youth civic engagement structures\n    And Jasmine has demonstrated leadership through care contributions\n    When the municipal_elohim identifies candidates for youth advisory board\n    Then Jasmine should be surfaced as a potential participant\n    And her care economy track record should demonstrate her capability\n    And selection should be based on demonstrated contribution, not just academic achievement\n    And diverse youth voices should be included in municipal governance\n    And teens should participate in decisions that affect their lives\n    And youth advisory structures should have real power, not just token representation\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns how local policy affects daily life\n    Given Jasmine participates in municipal care economy\n    And local policies shape her lived experience\n    When she engages with municipal systems through the Value Scanner\n    Then the municipal_elohim should make policy connections visible\n    And explain how local food policy affects her grocery shopping\n    And show how zoning decisions impact neighborhood walkability\n    And connect transit policy to her ability to access work and school\n    And help her understand that municipal governance is not abstract\n    And build her civic literacy through connection to daily experience\n\n  Scenario: Municipal data about teen contributions informs youth policy\n    Given thousands of teens participate in care economy across the municipality\n    And their contributions generate aggregate data about youth participation\n    When municipal_elohim analyzes youth care economy patterns\n    Then it should surface insights about teen contributions to city wellbeing\n    And show that youth provide substantial unpaid household labor\n    And demonstrate economic value of youth volunteering and community engagement\n    And inform municipal policy about youth employment and education\n    And shift public understanding from \"youth as problems\" to \"youth as contributors\"\n    And support evidence-based youth policy grounded in actual participation data\n\n  Scenario: Teen participates in municipal sustainability initiatives\n    Given the municipality has climate action and sustainability goals\n    And Jasmine makes consumption choices reflecting environmental values\n    When she participates in municipal environmental programs\n    Then her ecological care work should be tracked and valued\n    And municipal_elohim should aggregate youth environmental contributions\n    And recognize that youth climate activism is care work for future generations\n    And connect individual choices to municipal sustainability metrics\n    And demonstrate that youth environmental leadership advances city goals\n    And support her generation's investment in climate action\n\n  Scenario: Municipal transit and urban planning responsive to teen needs\n    Given Jasmine relies on public transit and walkable neighborhoods\n    And urban planning decisions affect her daily mobility\n    When the municipality makes transit and planning decisions\n    Then youth input should be actively solicited through municipal_elohim\n    And Jasmine's lived experience should inform planning\n    And teen mobility needs should shape transit routing and scheduling\n    And safe walking and biking infrastructure should reflect youth usage patterns\n    And municipal planning should recognize teens as legitimate urban space users\n    And age-friendly cities should include teen-friendly design\n\n  Scenario: Municipal food policy informed by teen participation patterns\n    Given Jasmine uses Value Scanner for food purchasing across the municipality\n    And aggregate data shows youth food access patterns\n    When municipal_elohim analyzes food security and access\n    Then it should surface insights about how teens access food\n    And identify food deserts affecting youth\n    And show impact of local food policy on teen nutrition\n    And inform municipal food policy with data about youth participation\n    And support evidence-based policy for food security\n    And recognize that teen food access matters to public health\n\n  Scenario: Teen's worker rights protected through municipal care economy\n    Given Jasmine works part-time in retail\n    And municipal labor regulations apply to her employment\n    When municipal_elohim monitors workplace conditions\n    Then it should track whether young workers are fairly treated\n    And flag systematic exploitation of teen labor\n    And surface if employers violate youth labor laws\n    And aggregate data about teen working conditions\n    And inform municipal labor policy enforcement\n    And protect young workers through care economy transparency\n\n  Scenario: Municipal resources accessible to teen based on care contribution\n    Given the municipality offers public services and resources\n    And Jasmine has demonstrated substantial care economy participation\n    When she seeks to access municipal programs\n    Then her care contributions should qualify her for access\n    And municipal_elohim should recognize her as a legitimate community member\n    And she should access libraries, recreation facilities, and public programs independently\n    And municipal services should be teen-accessible without parental mediation\n    And public resources should serve all ages based on contribution and need\n    And she should experience being a valued member of the city\n\n  Scenario: Teen civic engagement shapes municipal budget priorities\n    Given the municipality uses participatory budgeting processes\n    And Jasmine has demonstrated civic engagement\n    When municipal budget decisions are made\n    Then youth voice should be included in budget priority conversations\n    And Jasmine's care contributions should give her standing in budget discussions\n    And municipal_elohim should facilitate youth participation in participatory budgeting\n    And teen input should shape allocation of public resources\n    And she should learn that civic participation means influencing resource decisions\n    And democratic governance should include all age groups in budget processes\n\n  Scenario: Municipal care economy data informs state and federal policy\n    Given Riverside municipality has comprehensive care economy data\n    And thousands of teens participate in tracked care contributions\n    When state or federal policymakers study youth economics\n    Then municipal_elohim should provide anonymized aggregate data\n    And demonstrate economic value of teen care contributions at scale\n    And inform policy about youth employment, education, and wellbeing\n    And show that care economy framework reveals invisible youth labor\n    And support evidence-based policy at higher governance levels\n    And contribute to national conversation about youth participation in economy\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns lifecycle of democratic participation\n    Given Jasmine is years away from voting age\n    And democratic participation extends beyond voting\n    When she engages municipal governance through care economy\n    Then she should learn that civic engagement is continuous practice\n    And understand that democracy requires active participation, not just voting\n    And develop relationships with municipal institutions\n    And build civic skills through real participation in local governance\n    And internalize that she has legitimate voice in shaping her city\n    And grow into voting age already practiced in democratic engagement\n\n  Scenario: Municipal emergency response includes teen care contributions\n    Given the municipality experiences emergency situation (natural disaster, pandemic)\n    And community resilience depends on care economy networks\n    When emergency response is coordinated through municipal_elohim\n    Then teen care contributions should be recognized and mobilized\n    And Jasmine's capability should be matched to community needs\n    And youth mutual aid networks should be integrated into response\n    And teen volunteers should be valued as essential emergency workers\n    And care economy should demonstrate that communities survive crises through mutual care\n    And her generation should learn that civic responsibility includes crisis response\n",
