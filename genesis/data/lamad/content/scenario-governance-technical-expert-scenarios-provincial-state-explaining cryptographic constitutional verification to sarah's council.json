  "content": "Scenario: Explaining cryptographic constitutional verification to Sarah's council\n    Given Sarah Martinez's Regional Council reviews Marcus's mental health appeal\n    And the case involves cryptographic verification questions\n    When I provide expert testimony about the technical details\n    Then I translate: cryptographic proofs into accessible language\n    And I explain: using analogies (locked box showing answer without revealing secret)\n    And I clarify: what confidence levels mean and their limitations\n    And I acknowledge: where analogies break down and complexity remains\n    And I avoid: jargon that excludes or confuses\n    And I ensure: Sarah understands enough to judge constitutionality\n    And I inform: without dictating the decision\n",
