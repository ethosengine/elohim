Individual Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult\n  As a young adult (ages 18-25) in early independence\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want to build adult life skills and manage resources effectively\n  So that I develop sustainable practices and personal agency\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the young_adult user \"Aisha\" is registered in the system\n    And Aisha is 23 years old\n    And Aisha lives independently in her first solo apartment\n    And Aisha earns $38,000 annual salary\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Aisha's personal_agent is configured for capability development\n    And full adult privacy controls are enabled\n\n  Scenario: First-time budget planning for independent living\n    Given Aisha has a monthly grocery budget of $200\n    And she is learning to manage finances independently\n    When Aisha opens the Value Scanner budget planning feature\n    Then the personal_agent should display her monthly allocation\n    And the system should show remaining budget in real-time\n    And the interface should provide clear spending analytics\n    And budget recommendations should account for her income level\n    And the agent should help her balance immediate needs with future goals\n    And financial education should be integrated into the experience\n\n  Scenario: Learning meal planning without formal training\n    Given Aisha has minimal cooking experience\n    And she wants to eat nutritiously on a tight budget\n    When Aisha requests meal planning assistance\n    Then the personal_agent should suggest recipes based on her skill level\n    And recommendations should optimize nutrition per dollar\n    And the system should consider ingredients she already has\n    And the agent should teach cooking skills progressively\n    And meal plans should fit her time constraints\n    And the interface should feel like a patient teacher, not a critic\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent helps prevent expensive mistakes\n    Given Aisha bought too much fresh produce last week\n    And the produce spoiled before she could use it\n    When the personal_agent analyzes her shopping patterns\n    Then it should identify the waste pattern\n    And it should suggest buying smaller quantities\n    And it should recommend frozen alternatives when appropriate\n    And the feedback should be constructive, not judgmental\n    And Aisha should learn from the mistake without shame\n    And the system should help her optimize future purchases\n\n  Scenario: Building nutrition awareness while managing costs\n    Given Aisha has been working through lunch frequently\n    And her energy levels are declining\n    When the personal_agent reviews her eating patterns\n    Then it should flag the concerning pattern\n    And it should say \"You've worked through lunch four days this week\"\n    And it should suggest quick, nutritious options within budget\n    And the agent should help her see self-care as essential, not optional\n    And recommendations should balance nutrition, cost, and time constraints\n\n  Scenario: Developing sustainable shopping habits independently\n    Given Aisha is establishing her adult shopping patterns\n    And she wants to reduce food waste\n    When Aisha scans items at the store\n    Then the personal_agent should track purchase patterns\n    And it should identify what she consistently uses versus what spoils\n    And it should suggest sustainable alternatives\n    And the system should help her build efficient shopping habits\n    And waste reduction analytics should inform future decisions\n    And Aisha should develop adult competence through practice\n\n  Scenario: Managing competing demands on personal resources\n    Given Aisha has limited time and energy\n    And she must balance work, self-care, and family obligations\n    When Aisha plans her week in the Value Scanner\n    Then the personal_agent should help her allocate care capacity\n    And it should flag when she's over-committed\n    And it should recognize self-care as legitimate care work\n    And recommendations should support sustainable work-life balance\n    And the system should help her set healthy boundaries\n\n  Scenario: Privacy controls for adult financial independence\n    Given Aisha has full adult autonomy\n    And she wants to keep financial details private\n    When Aisha configures her privacy settings\n    Then she should have complete control over data sharing\n    And her financial information should remain private by default\n    And she should explicitly consent to any family visibility\n    And workplace should have no access to personal data\n    And privacy controls should be granular and transparent\n    And the system should respect her adult independence\n\n  Scenario: Tracking personal growth in life skills\n    Given Aisha has been using the Value Scanner for three months\n    And she's developing adult household management skills\n    When Aisha reviews her progress\n    Then the system should show skill development over time\n    And it should highlight improvements in waste reduction\n    And it should track nutritional balance improvements\n    And it should show budget optimization progress\n    And the feedback should build confidence and competence\n    And Aisha should see evidence of her growing capability\n\n  Scenario: Multi-store comparison for budget optimization\n    Given Aisha's limited budget requires strategic shopping\n    And different stores offer different value propositions\n    When Aisha compares shopping options\n    Then the personal_agent should analyze prices across stores\n    And it should consider transportation costs in calculations\n    And it should identify where spending more saves money long-term\n    And recommendations should optimize total value, not just price\n    And the system should help her find efficiency frontiers\n    And decision support should build financial literacy\n\n  Scenario: Recognition of self-care as care work\n    Given Aisha tends to prioritize work over personal needs\n    And burnout would undermine all her capabilities\n    When the personal_agent monitors her well-being\n    Then it should recognize self-care as legitimate care work\n    And it should flag when self-care is being neglected\n    And it should help her understand that caring for herself enables other contributions\n    And the system should validate rest and nutrition as valuable\n    And Aisha should learn that personal stewardship is foundational\n\n  Scenario: Building adult financial literacy through practice\n    Given Aisha received no practical finance education in school\n    And she's learning by doing with real consequences\n    When Aisha makes financial decisions in the scanner\n    Then the personal_agent should provide contextual education\n    And it should explain trade-offs in accessible language\n    And it should help her understand opportunity costs\n    And education should integrate seamlessly with decision-making\n    And Aisha should build financial competence through supported practice\n    And the system should prevent catastrophic mistakes while enabling learning\n\n  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained for adult user\n    Given Aisha has full autonomy over technology use\n    And the constitutional constraints apply at all layers\n    When Aisha chooses to disconnect from the system\n    Then the disconnection must be honored immediately\n    And all data retention must follow legal minimums only\n    And no manipulative patterns should attempt to retain usage\n    And Aisha's right to opt out must be absolute\n    And the system must respect her sovereign choice\n",
