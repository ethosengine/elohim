  "content": "Scenario: Resisting corporate lobbying for regulatory capture\n    Given tech companies lobby for regulations favoring incumbents\n    And they push: backdoor mandates, centralization requirements, licensing barriers\n    When I defend protocol sovereignty against capture\n    Then I use: cryptographic impossibility arguments (backdoors break verification)\n    And I present: evidence that regulation would harm innovation\n    And I coalition: with community leaders showing grassroots opposition\n    And I reference: international examples of protocol sovereignty working\n    And I require: transparency about lobbying and funding\n    And I resist: well-funded pressure through political courage\n    And I protect: democratic governance from corporate control\n",
