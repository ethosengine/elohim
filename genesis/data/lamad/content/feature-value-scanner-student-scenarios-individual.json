This is dangerous.\"\n    And it should help him identify what must give to protect health\n    And it should connect him to campus mental health resources if needed\n    And crisis intervention should prioritize his survival\n    And the system should validate that breaking under these demands is not failure\n\n  Scenario: Developing cooking skills as care economy capability\n    Given Kenji is learning to cook efficiently on tight budget\n    And cooking is new skill he's developing as independent adult\n    When the personal_agent teaches Kenji cooking techniques\n    Then it should provide patient, practical instruction\n    And it should teach him to plan meals that use ingredients efficiently\n    And it should help him learn techniques that reduce prep time\n    And the agent should recognize cooking as care economy skill\n    And it should validate his progress: \"You can now make 5 meals confidently\"\n    And Kenji should experience cooking as capability, not chore\n\n  Scenario: Care token accumulation for self-care and household contributions\n    Given Kenji prepares nutritious meals for himself\n    And he manages his space, does laundry, and maintains basic self-care\n    When the Value Scanner tracks Kenji's individual care contributions\n    Then it should accumulate care tokens for self-care labor\n    And it should recognize that caring for himself is care economy work\n    And it should track his development of adult life skills\n    And self-maintenance should be valued, not invisible\n    And the system should make visible the work of sustaining himself\n    And Kenji should see that taking care of himself is productive\n\n  Scenario: Financial literacy development through care economy lens\n    Given Kenji must manage all his finances independently\n    And he receives financial aid, earns wages, and makes all spending decisions\n    When the personal_agent teaches financial management\n    Then it should frame finances through care economy principles\n    And it should teach him to value care contributions alongside paid work\n    And it should help him understand exploitation vs. fair exchange\n    And the agent should build financial literacy integrated with care values\n    And Kenji should learn to see economy as care exchange, not just money\n    And financial capability should be built on care economy foundation\n\n  Scenario: Privacy and autonomy as emerging independent adult\n    Given Kenji is establishing adult independence\n    And he has full rights to privacy in his personal life\n    When care economy data is collected about Kenji\n    Then he must have complete control over all personal information\n    And no data should be shared with family or school without his consent\n    And his adult autonomy should be respected completely\n    And privacy should be default, not something he must request\n    And the system should support his development of adult boundaries\n    And Kenji's data sovereignty should be absolute\n\n  Scenario: Learning to recognize own needs and ask for help\n    Given Kenji is navigating adult independence for first time\n    And college culture often treats struggling as weakness\n    When Kenji faces challenges beyond his current capacity\n    Then the personal_agent should teach him to recognize when he needs help\n    And it should normalize asking for support as strength, not failure\n    And it should connect him to available resources (food bank, counseling, emergency aid)\n    And the agent should validate that everyone needs help sometimes\n    And the system should counteract toxic independence culture\n    And Kenji should learn that care economy includes receiving care\n\n  Scenario: Time management for competing demands\n    Given Kenji must balance 15 hours work, full academic load, and household responsibilities\n    And time is his most constrained resource\n    When the personal_agent helps Kenji manage his schedule\n    Then it should teach realistic time budgeting\n    And it should help him prioritize among competing demands\n    And it should recognize time spent on care work as real constraint\n    And the agent should validate that he cannot do everything\n    And it should help him make conscious trade-offs\n    And Kenji should learn sustainable pacing for long-term success\n\n  Scenario: Building resilience through care economy participation\n    Given Kenji faces significant stress and uncertainty\n    And he is geographically separated from family support networks\n    When the personal_agent supports Kenji's resilience development\n    Then it should recognize his participation in care economy as building connection\n    And it should show how his care contributions create community\n    And it should validate that resilience comes from reciprocal relationships\n    And the agent should help him build care networks in temporary community\n    And the system should teach that care economy creates security\n    And Kenji should learn that giving and receiving care builds resilience\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing that student patterns shape adult life\n    Given Kenji is forming habits and patterns that will persist\n    And his college years are when adult identity and practices solidify\n    When the personal_agent reflects on Kenji's pattern development\n    Then it should help him see that current choices shape future self\n    And it should validate that learning care economy now matters lifelong\n    And it should recognize this developmental phase as formative\n    And the agent should support intentional pattern-building\n    And the system should help Kenji become the adult he wants to be\n    And student years should be recognized as foundation-laying time\n",
