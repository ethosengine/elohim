  "content": "Scenario: Family care economy coordinates reciprocity across generations\n    Given Sarah receives childcare support from grandparents\n    And Sarah provides elder care to her aging parents\n    When the family_elohim analyzes care flows\n    Then it should show reciprocal care patterns\n    And it should ensure care is not unidirectionally extractive\n    And it should coordinate so care flows equitably\n    And family relationships should be based on mutual support\n    And the system should enable sustainable multigenerational care\n    And care economy should prevent family exploitation\n",
