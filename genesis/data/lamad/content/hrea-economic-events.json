  "content": "# Economic Events: Where Value Becomes Visible\n\n## What is an Economic Event?\n\nAn Economic Event in hREA is an **observed economic flow** - something that actually happened, involving resources moving between agents.\n\nUnlike intents (what might happen) or commitments (what will happen), events are **facts** - recorded observations of value creation.\n\n## Event Anatomy\n\nEvery economic event records:\n\n| Field | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `action` | The verb: produce, consume, transfer, use, work, cite |\n| `provider` | The agent giving the resource |\n| `receiver` | The agent receiving the resource |\n| `resourceQuantity` | How much of what |\n| `effortQuantity` | Labor involved (for work actions) |\n| `hasPointInTime` | When it happened |\n\n## Actions: The Verbs of Value\n\nhREA defines standard actions:\n\n- **produce**: Create a new resource\n- **consume**: Use up a resource\n- **use**: Apply a resource without consuming it\n- **work**: Apply effort/labor\n- **transfer**: Move resource between agents\n- **cite**: Reference another's work\n- **modify**: Transform a resource\n\n## Care Work as Economic Events\n\nA caregiver's day creates many events:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"work\",\n  \"provider\": \"parent_maria\",\n  \"receiver\": \"family_household\",\n  \"effortQuantity\": { \"value\": 3, \"unit\": \"hours\" },\n  \"note\": \"Meal preparation, homework help, emotional support\",\n  \"resourceClassifiedAs\": [\"care-work\", \"household-labor\"]\n}\n```\n\nIn traditional accounting, this is invisible.\nIn REA accounting, this is a recorded economic event.\n\n## Track and Trace\n\nEvents connect into flows:\n- `previous`: What events led to this one\n- `next`: What events follow from this one\n- `track`: Follow resources forward\n- `trace`: Follow resources backward\n\nThis creates **value chain visibility** - seeing how care and creation flow through communities.",
