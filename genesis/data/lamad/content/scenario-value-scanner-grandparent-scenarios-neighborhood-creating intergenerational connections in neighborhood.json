  "content": "Scenario: Creating intergenerational connections in neighborhood\n    Given Margaret engages with neighbors of all ages\n    And she bridges generational divides through relationships\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks social connections\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's role in intergenerational connection\n    And it should value her relationships with children, parents, and elders\n    And she should help create all-ages neighborhood culture\n    And intergenerational mixing should strengthen neighborhood resilience\n    And Margaret's social bridging should be recognized as care work\n    And neighborhood should benefit from cross-generational relationships\n",
