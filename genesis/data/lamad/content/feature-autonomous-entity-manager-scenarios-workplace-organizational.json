Democratic Coordination in Workplace for Manager\n  As a manager in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer\n  I want to facilitate effective coordination without domination\n  So that operations function smoothly while respecting worker autonomy\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Marcus serves as democratic coordinator at ChickenMax\n    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active\n    And governance is genuinely democratic, not hierarchical theater\n\n  Scenario: Manager facilitates scheduling through negotiation, not command\n    Given workers need coordinated schedule balancing operational and personal needs\n    And corporate model had Marcus impose schedule unilaterally\n    When scheduling conflicts arise\n    Then Marcus proposes schedule based on operational requirements\n    And Marcus facilitates negotiation between workers with competing needs\n    And workers modify proposal based on their life circumstances\n    And workers democratically approve final schedule\n    And Marcus cannot override worker decision\n    And workplace_elohim ensures process remains democratic\n\n  Scenario: Manager proposes operational changes requiring democratic approval\n    Given Marcus identifies efficiency improvement opportunity\n    And corporate model would have him implement changes by fiat\n    When Marcus wants to implement the operational change\n    Then Marcus presents proposal to worker council with clear rationale\n    And workers deliberate on benefits and potential downsides\n    And workers ask clarifying questions Marcus answers transparently\n    And workers vote on whether to adopt the change\n    And if approved, Marcus coordinates implementation\n    And if rejected, Marcus accepts decision and proposes alternatives\n\n  Scenario: Manager mediates conflict without imposing judgment\n    Given two workers have disagreement about task allocation\n    And corporate model had Marcus impose solution or discipline both\n    When workers bring conflict to Marcus for mediation\n    Then Marcus facilitates structured conversation between parties\n    And Marcus helps each worker express their perspective and needs\n    And Marcus proposes potential compromise solutions\n    And workers, not Marcus, decide on resolution\n    And workplace_elohim documents process ensuring fairness\n    And conflict resolves through dialogue, not managerial authority\n\n  Scenario: Manager's facilitation effectiveness is democratically evaluated\n    Given workers want accountability for coordinator role\n    And corporate model had no worker input on manager performance\n    When quarterly facilitation review occurs\n    Then workers provide feedback on Marcus's coordination effectiveness\n    And workers rate his facilitation skills, transparency, and respect for autonomy\n    And feedback informs Marcus's continued development\n    And poor evaluations trigger support and training, not immediate termination\n    And sustained poor performance enables democratic recall\n    And workplace_elohim ensures fair evaluation process\n\n  Scenario: Manager provides operational expertise without information asymmetry\n    Given Marcus has knowledge of inventory levels, supplier costs, and operational data\n    And corporate model used information asymmetry to maintain power\n    When Marcus uses operational information for coordination\n    Then all data Marcus sees is equally visible to workers\n    And Marcus cannot hoard information to manipulate outcomes\n    And workers access same dashboards, reports, and metrics\n    And Marcus's value comes from synthesizing information, not controlling it\n    And workplace_elohim ensures transparency of all operational data\n\n  Scenario: Manager coordinates customer feedback without targeting individuals\n    Given customers provide feedback about service and quality\n    And corporate model had Marcus use feedback to discipline workers\n    When customer feedback arrives\n    Then Marcus aggregates patterns without targeting individuals\n    And Marcus presents feedback trends to worker council\n    And workers discuss how to address systemic issues collaboratively\n    And individual worker incidents are handled through peer process, not manager discipline\n    And workplace_elohim prevents feedback from becoming surveillance weapon\n\n  Scenario: Manager transitions operational knowledge to worker collective over time\n    Given Marcus holds tacit knowledge from years of operations management\n    And democratic model requires distributing this knowledge to workers\n    When knowledge transfer process begins\n    Then Marcus documents operational procedures and decision frameworks\n    And Marcus trains workers in business operations through structured learning\n    And workers gradually take on tasks previously Marcus's sole domain\n    And after 18 months, workers govern operations with Marcus in purely advisory role\n    And workplace_elohim tracks knowledge distribution preventing re-concentration\n\n  Scenario: Manager coordinates supply chain logistics while workers govern relationships\n    Given workers democratically selected Johnson Farm as supplier\n    And day-to-day ordering and logistics needs coordination\n    When supply chain operations continue\n    Then Marcus manages ordering logistics and inventory tracking\n    And Marcus coordinates deliveries and quality checks\n    But workers govern supplier relationship and strategic decisions\n    And Marcus cannot unilaterally change suppliers or negotiate major terms\n    And his coordination role enables worker governance, not replaces it\n\n  Scenario: Manager facilitates worker council meetings without controlling agenda\n    Given worker councils meet weekly for governance decisions\n    And corporate model had Marcus control meeting agenda and outcomes\n    When worker council convenes\n    Then workers set meeting agenda, not Marcus\n    And Marcus facilitates discussion to keep meeting productive\n    And Marcus ensures all voices are heard but doesn't dominate discussion\n    And workers make decisions through democratic process Marcus facilitates\n    And workplace_elohim monitors for subtle manipulation or agenda control\n\n  Scenario: Manager's proposals can be rejected without retaliation\n    Given Marcus proposes operational change he believes is beneficial\n    And workers deliberate and vote to reject the proposal\n    When rejection occurs\n    Then Marcus accepts worker decision gracefully\n    And Marcus does not retaliate through subtle means\n    And Marcus proposes alternative approaches respecting worker concerns\n    And workers know their democratic power is real, not performative\n    And workplace_elohim ensures rejected proposals don't resurface as subtle coercion\n\n  Scenario: Manager participates in democratic ownership as worker-peer\n    Given Marcus's coordinator role doesn't exclude him from worker-ownership\n    And his governance weight reflects his facilitation contribution\n    When major strategic decisions are made (profit distribution, reinvestment, etc.)\n    Then Marcus participates as worker-owner with weighted voice\n    And his coordination role is valued but doesn't grant special ownership privilege\n    And his tokens accumulate based on witnessed contribution like all workers\n    And he benefits from collective success he helps facilitate\n    And workplace_elohim prevents coordinator role from becoming ownership concentration\n",
