  "content": "Scenario: Family governance decisions made collaboratively\n    Given family faces major decisions about parent care\n    And decisions affect multiple family members\n    And Robert's voice carries weight but shouldn't dominate\n    When family_elohim facilitates governance decisions\n    Then it should support collaborative family decision-making\n    And ensure Robert's parents have voice in their own care\n    And include siblings in care planning decisions\n    And respect adult children's emerging voice in family governance\n    And help family navigate power dynamics and competing needs\n    And support decisions that honor all family members' wellbeing\n    And prevent decisions that sacrifice one generation for another\n",
