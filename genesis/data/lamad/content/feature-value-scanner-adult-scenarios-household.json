Household Layer Value Recognition for Adult\n  As an adult managing a household\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want equitable care labor distribution and resource coordination\n  So that household flourishing is built on visible, valued contributions from all members\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the adult user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah shares a household with her partner\n    And they have children Tommy (5) and Emma (8)\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And the household_elohim is coordinating household care economy\n    And household income is $65k/year combined\n\n  Scenario: Making both partners' care contributions visible\n    Given Sarah performs meal planning, shopping, cooking, child coordination\n    And her partner performs other household labor\n    And much of this work is invisible in traditional economics\n    When the household_elohim tracks contributions\n    Then both partners' care work should be quantified specifically\n    And invisible labor imbalances should become visible\n    And Sarah and partner should see who's doing what\n    And data should replace resentment in household discussions\n    And visibility should enable fair distribution negotiations\n\n  Scenario: Household resource allocation based on visible contributions\n    Given Sarah and partner make joint financial decisions\n    And both contribute care labor to household\n    When household resources are allocated\n    Then the household_elohim should present both partners' contributions\n    And care labor should be valued alongside paid employment\n    And Sarah's unpaid care work should carry equal weight to partner's income\n    And resource decisions should reflect all contributions, not just money\n    And household economics should recognize care creates value\n\n  Scenario: Preventing invisible labor imbalances that damage relationships\n    Given household labor often falls unfairly on women\n    And invisible imbalances breed resentment\n    When the household_elohim monitors labor distribution\n    Then it should identify unfair distributions early\n    And it should surface imbalances before they cause conflict\n    And both partners should receive prompts about equity\n    And adjustments should be negotiated from data, not resentment\n    And the protocol should protect relationship health through fairness\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating complex household schedules across family members\n    Given Sarah manages her work schedule, children's schools, household tasks, appointments\n    And partner has separate work schedule and obligations\n    When household activities need coordination\n    Then the household_elohim should integrate all family calendars\n    And it should identify conflicts across household members\n    And it should suggest solutions that work for everyone\n    And schedule coordination should reduce stress, not increase it\n    And household operations should run smoothly through effective coordination\n\n  Scenario: Household budget management with care economy principles\n    Given household operates on $65k/year budget\n    And resources must cover housing, food, children's needs, healthcare, saving\n    When Sarah makes purchasing decisions\n    Then the household_elohim should track spending against budget\n    And it should integrate financial constraints with family needs\n    And it should help Sarah and partner make informed trade-offs\n    And budget should reflect care priorities, not just consumption\n    And financial management should serve household flourishing\n\n  Scenario: Equitable labor distribution negotiated with care economy data\n    Given Sarah feels she's doing more than her fair share\n    And her partner may not see the full scope of her labor\n    When they discuss household labor distribution\n    Then the household_elohim should provide specific contribution data\n    And Sarah's invisible labor should be quantified explicitly\n    And both partners should see objective assessment\n    And negotiations should be based on facts, not perceptions\n    And equitable arrangements should be reachable through visibility\n\n  Scenario: Household care tokens reflect combined family contributions\n    Given household participates in care token economy\n    And both adults and children contribute care labor\n    When household care tokens are calculated\n    Then tokens should accumulate from all members' contributions\n    And Sarah's care work should be valued appropriately\n    And partner's contributions should be recognized\n    And children's age-appropriate care work should count\n    And household should receive care token supplements for income level\n    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status\n\n  Scenario: Household governance includes children at appropriate developmental levels\n    Given Tommy (5) and Emma (8) are household members\n    And they contribute care labor at age-appropriate levels\n    When household decisions are made\n    Then children should have voice appropriate to their development\n    And Emma should have more input than Tommy\n    And both should experience participating in household governance\n    And the household_elohim should coordinate different permission levels\n    And family democracy should be practiced, not just taught\n\n  Scenario: Household boundaries coordinate with individual autonomy\n    Given Sarah has individual autonomy over her choices\n    And she also participates in household governance\n    When Sarah makes decisions affecting the household\n    Then household boundaries should be negotiated, not imposed\n    And Sarah should maintain individual agency within household context\n    And household_elohim should balance individual and collective needs\n    And neither Sarah nor partner should dominate household governance\n    And equitable partnership should be structurally supported\n\n  Scenario: Household privacy protected from external surveillance\n    Given household care economy generates detailed family data\n    And this data reveals intimate household patterns\n    When household data is collected\n    Then it must remain under household members' control\n    And no external entities should access household data without consent\n    And workplace should never see household care patterns\n    And community should only see what household chooses to share\n    And household privacy should be absolutely protected\n\n  Scenario: Household food security supported through care token supplements\n    Given household income is $65k/year\n    And food costs are rising\n    When household's economic status qualifies for support\n    Then care token supplements should be available\n    And the Value Scanner should remain accessible\n    And household should not face food insecurity\n    And care economy should function as economic support system\n    And access should be dignified, not stigmatizing\n\n  Scenario: Household coordination during crisis maintains stability\n    Given household faces crisis\u2014job loss, illness, emergency\n    And normal operations are disrupted\n    When the household_elohim detects crisis conditions\n    Then it should shift to crisis support mode\n    And it should help household prioritize essential functions\n    And it should connect household to emergency resources\n    And it should maintain household stability under stress\n    And the protocol should serve as household safety net\n",
