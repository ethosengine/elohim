Municipal Economic Development Through Democratic Investment\n  As a community_investor in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the municipality governance layer\n  I want to support citywide democratic economy development\n  So that municipal policy enables community investment and democratic ownership\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Patricia's community investment is part of emerging municipal democratic economy\n    And the municipality governance context is active\n    And community investment demonstrates alternative to corporate economic development\n\n  Scenario: Community investment demonstrates alternative to corporate subsidy model\n    Given municipal economic development typically subsidizes corporate expansion\n    And Patricia's taxes funded corporate subsidies with minimal community benefit\n    When community investment proves superior economic development strategy\n    Then her $10K investment creates more jobs and better wages than equivalent corporate subsidy\n    And no public money is required\u2014private capital supports democratic conversions\n    And municipal officials observe community investment effectiveness\n    And economic development strategy shifts toward supporting democratic ownership\n    And municipality_elohim documents community investment outcomes for policy advocacy\n\n  Scenario: Investor advocates for municipal community investment tax incentives\n    Given municipality offers tax breaks for corporate investment\n    And community investment lacks equivalent policy support\n    When Patricia and other investors organize for policy change\n    Then they advocate to city council for community investment tax credits\n    And propose municipal matching funds for community investment pools\n    And credible advocacy comes from investors who've proven model viability\n    And municipal policy evolves to support community investment and democratic ownership\n    And municipality_elohim coordinates investor advocacy and policy development\n\n  Scenario: Municipal community investment fund amplifies private capital\n    Given community investment pools have limited capital for large conversions\n    And municipal economic development funds could support democratic ownership\n    When city creates municipal community investment fund\n    Then Patricia's private investment is matched by public funds\n    And combined capital enables larger conversions (grocery stores, manufacturers)\n    And public-private partnership supports democratic economy at scale\n    And taxpayer money supports community wealth-building, not corporate extraction\n    And municipality_elohim manages public-private community investment coordination\n\n  Scenario: Investor network coordinates citywide democratic business support\n    Given isolated community investment pools lack coordination\n    And municipal-scale transformation requires network coordination\n    When investors organize citywide community investment network\n    Then capital is coordinated across neighborhoods for strategic conversions\n    And successful practices are shared across community investment pools\n    And collective bargaining power increases with financial institutions\n    And citywide democratic economy infrastructure develops through investor coordination\n    And municipality_elohim facilitates citywide investor network coordination\n\n  Scenario: Community investment outcomes inform municipal workforce development\n    Given workforce development programs prepare workers for corporate employment\n    And democratic businesses need workers with cooperative governance skills\n    When community investors demonstrate democratic business viability\n    Then municipal workforce programs add cooperative business and democratic governance training\n    And workers are prepared for democratic enterprise participation\n    And investor advocacy influences workforce development policy\n    And municipal investment in workforce supports democratic economy growth\n    And municipality_elohim coordinates democratic business training curriculum development\n\n  Scenario: Municipal procurement policies prioritize democratically-owned businesses\n    Given city purchases goods and services from private vendors\n    And public procurement can support democratic economy development\n    When investors advocate for democratic business procurement preferences\n    Then municipal contracts give priority to worker-owned businesses\n    And Patricia's investments benefit from stable public sector demand\n    And taxpayer money supports living wages and democratic governance\n    And procurement policy demonstrates municipal commitment to economic democracy\n    And municipality_elohim tracks democratic business procurement and impacts\n\n  Scenario: Community investment supports municipal affordable housing development\n    Given housing is major community need and investment opportunity\n    And Patricia wants to invest in affordable housing with democratic governance\n    When community investment expands to housing cooperatives\n    Then her capital supports converting apartment buildings to resident ownership\n    And affordable housing is preserved through democratic governance\n    And housing investment provides returns while addressing municipal affordability crisis\n    And community wealth-building extends to housing alongside businesses\n    And municipality_elohim coordinates housing cooperative investment and development\n\n  Scenario: Municipal economic development metrics evolve to measure democratic ownership\n    Given cities measure economic development by job quantity, not quality\n    And Patricia's investments create high-quality jobs (living wages, ownership, voice)\n    When community investors demonstrate democratic ownership benefits\n    Then municipal metrics include: worker ownership rates, wage levels, democratic governance participation\n    And economic development success is measured by community wealth-building\n    And democratic conversions score highly on quality-focused metrics\n    And policy priorities shift toward job quality through investor advocacy\n    And municipality_elohim provides democratic economy measurement framework\n\n  Scenario: Investor coordinates with municipal climate action through sustainable business investment\n    Given municipal climate action requires reducing emissions and building resilience\n    And Patricia's investments support sustainable democratic businesses\n    When community investment aligns with municipal climate goals\n    Then democratic businesses achieve climate targets (local sourcing, renewable energy, waste reduction)\n    And community investment supports climate-positive enterprises\n    And municipal climate funding can support democratic business conversions\n    And climate action and economic democracy align through coordinated investment\n    And municipality_elohim coordinates climate-aligned democratic business investment\n\n  Scenario: Community investment enables municipal small business preservation\n    Given small business displacement threatens community character and economic diversity\n    And Patricia values preserving local businesses as community institutions\n    When community investment supports exit-to-community conversions\n    Then small businesses are preserved as democratic enterprises, not displaced by chains\n    And municipal economic diversity is maintained through democratic conversions\n    And community investment becomes small business preservation strategy\n    And neighborhood character is protected through democratic ownership\n    And municipality_elohim tracks small business preservation through community investment\n\n  Scenario: Municipal financial institutions develop community investment products\n    Given banks and credit unions lack experience with democratic business investment\n    And institutional support would scale community investment dramatically\n    When Patricia and other investors demonstrate model viability\n    Then local banks develop community investment accounts and funds\n    And credit unions prioritize democratic business lending\n    And financial institutions see community investment as sound business opportunity\n    And municipal policy supports financial institution democratic business focus\n    And municipality_elohim coordinates with financial institutions on product development\n\n  Scenario: Investor participation in municipal economic development planning\n    Given economic development planning typically excludes community voices\n    And Patricia has expertise from community investment experience\n    When municipal planning includes community investor participation\n    Then she serves on economic development advisory committees\n    And community investment perspective informs municipal strategy\n    And policy development benefits from investor practical knowledge\n    And democratic economy becomes recognized municipal economic development approach\n    And municipality_elohim facilitates community investor participation in municipal planning\n",
