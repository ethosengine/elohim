  "content": "Scenario: Sharing care work across sibling network\n    Given siblings may have different capacities for family care\n    And my work schedule limits my hands-on participation\n    When the family needs ongoing care coordination\n    Then the protocol should help distribute care work fairly\n    And recognize that my employment constraints affect availability\n    And identify where I can contribute given my limitations\n    And support negotiation toward equitable family care distribution\n",
