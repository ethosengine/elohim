National-Level Governance Research for Researcher\n  As a researcher in the governance system\n  Operating at the national governance layer\n  I want to analyze governance patterns affecting entire nations\n  So that I can inform national policy and understand democratic AI at scale\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the researcher user is registered in the system\n    And the nation_state governance context is active\n    And Dr. James Chen is studying national-scale democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Analyzing national Constitutional Council precedent development\n    Given National Constitutional Council has created precedents affecting millions\n    And I have access to five years of national-level decisions\n    When I analyze how constitutional interpretation evolves over time\n    Then I examine: consistency of principles across diverse cases\n    And I track: precedent citation patterns and influence\n    And I identify: watershed decisions that reshaped interpretation\n    And I analyze: how dissenting opinions influence future majorities\n    And I assess: whether interpretation drifts from constitutional text\n    And I explore: emergence of constitutional \"common law\" through cases\n    And My research reveals: how citizen governance creates coherent jurisprudence\n\n  Scenario: National longitudinal study tracking 10-year outcomes\n    Given Elohim Protocol has been adopted nationally for a decade\n    And I am conducting comprehensive longitudinal evaluation\n    When I analyze decade-long trajectories across thousands of communities\n    Then I measure: sustained vs transient effects on wellbeing\n    And I track: whether initial trust gains persist or decay\n    And I examine: how children growing up with protocol differ from previous generation\n    And I analyze: whether protocol transforms civic culture over time\n    And I investigate: institutional evolution and adaptation patterns\n    And I assess: whether benefits compound or plateau over time\n    And My research captures: transformative effects that short-term studies miss\n\n  Scenario: Comparing national adoption across different political systems\n    Given different nations with different political systems adopted protocol\n    And I want to understand how political context shapes implementation\n    When I conduct cross-national comparative analysis\n    Then I examine: adoption patterns in democracies vs mixed regimes\n    And I analyze: how existing institutions integrate or resist protocol\n    And I explore: whether protocol strengthens or threatens existing power structures\n    And I assess: cultural factors that predict adoption success\n    And I identify: universal patterns vs context-dependent adaptations\n    And My research tests: whether democratic AI governance is culturally specific or universal\n    And Findings inform: international adoption strategies and expectations\n\n  Scenario: Evaluating national policy impact on protocol outcomes\n    Given Senator Ruiz passed legislation supporting protocol adoption\n    And I want to assess whether policy actually improved outcomes\n    When I analyze communities before and after policy implementation\n    Then I examine: whether funding increased adoption rates\n    And I assess: whether legal recognition improved legitimacy\n    And I measure: whether infrastructure support reduced access barriers\n    And I explore: whether regulatory protection prevented capture\n    And I identify: which policy mechanisms worked and which didn't\n    And My evaluation provides: evidence for continued funding and policy refinement\n    And Research serves: accountability and improvement of democratic policy\n\n  Scenario: Studying national crisis response and protocol resilience\n    Given nation experienced major crisis (pandemic, economic collapse, climate disaster)\n    And protocol governance was tested under extreme conditions\n    When I analyze how protocol functioned during and after crisis\n    Then I examine: whether emergency coordination maintained democratic oversight\n    And I assess: whether crisis pressures led to authoritarian drift\n    And I measure: community resilience with protocol vs without\n    And I explore: how Constitutional Councils balanced urgency with deliberation\n    And I identify: protocol vulnerabilities revealed under stress\n    And I analyze: recovery trajectories and institutional learning\n    And My research reveals: whether democratic AI governance is resilient or fragile\n\n  Scenario: National survey research on public trust and legitimacy\n    Given I need to understand population-wide attitudes toward protocol\n    And survey data provides breadth that case studies cannot\n    When I conduct nationally representative survey on protocol governance\n    Then I measure: trust in agents vs trust in traditional institutions\n    And I assess: perceived legitimacy of Constitutional Councils\n    And I explore: what predicts individual support or opposition\n    And I examine: demographic patterns in trust and participation\n    And I track: opinion changes over time as protocol matures\n    And I identify: sources of resistance and paths to broader acceptance\n    And My research informs: public engagement and communication strategies\n\n  Scenario: Analyzing national media discourse about AI governance\n    Given public understanding is shaped by media coverage\n    And I want to understand how protocol is portrayed and discussed\n    When I analyze national media coverage over time\n    Then I examine: framing (opportunity vs threat, freedom vs control)\n    And I identify: key narratives and their evolution\n    And I assess: accuracy of coverage vs actual protocol function\n    And I explore: elite discourse vs grassroots perspectives\n    And I analyze: how coverage affects public opinion and adoption\n    And I track: whether critical discourse improves protocol or undermines it\n    And My research reveals: democratic deliberation about democratic AI\n\n  Scenario: Providing congressional testimony on protocol effectiveness\n    Given Congress is considering national AI governance legislation\n    And Senator Ruiz invites me to testify as independent expert\n    When I present research findings to legislative committee\n    Then I summarize: rigorous evaluation of protocol outcomes\n    And I present: evidence about effectiveness, limitations, and unknowns\n    And I explain: what factors predict success and failure\n    And I testify: honestly about uncertainties and contested findings\n    And I respond: to questions from supportive and skeptical legislators\n    And I maintain: scientific independence over political pressure\n    And My testimony provides: evidence base for democratic policy choice\n\n  Scenario: National research infrastructure enabling cumulative knowledge\n    Given sustainable research requires ongoing data access and funding\n    And I advocate for long-term research infrastructure\n    When national research program is established with public funding\n    Then independent researchers gain: anonymized data access with privacy protection\n    And longitudinal tracking becomes: possible across decades\n    And replication and extension: of findings is enabled\n    And peer review and quality control: maintain scientific standards\n    And research independence from: protocol developers is preserved\n    And Knowledge accumulates: rather than being rediscovered each generation\n    And Democratic AI governance becomes: evidence-based rather than ideological\n\n  Scenario: Studying national Constitutional Convention as deliberative democracy\n    Given National Constitutional Convention convenes with randomly-selected citizens\n    And this is largest deliberative democracy experiment in history\n    When I study the convention process and outcomes\n    Then I examine: how 10,000 citizens deliberate on existential questions\n    And I analyze: what enables productive vs polarizing disagreement\n    And I assess: quality of deliberation at unprecedented scale\n    And I explore: how amendments emerge from collective wisdom\n    And I track: influence of diverse perspectives vs expert domination\n    And I investigate: whether citizens can make wise choices under deep uncertainty\n    And My research tests: limits and possibilities of democratic capacity\n\n  Scenario: Null findings about protocol effects inform honest assessment\n    Given my analysis found protocol didn't improve outcomes in certain domains\n    And publication bias favors positive results\n    When I publish findings showing limitations and failures\n    Then I report: honestly about what doesn't work\n    And I provide: evidence challenging protocol advocates' claims\n    And I maintain: scientific integrity over ideological commitment\n    And I enable: realistic expectations and targeted improvements\n    And I contribute: to honest democratic deliberation about governance alternatives\n    And My credibility comes from: willingness to report unflattering truths\n    And Science serves democracy by: providing reliable knowledge not propaganda\n\n  Scenario: Research on superintelligence governance and democratic legitimacy\n    Given my most important research question is existential\n    And I study whether sortition can govern superintelligent agents\n    When I analyze Constitutional Council confidence over time as agents advance\n    Then I measure: council member certainty declining as agent capability increases\n    And I document: increasing expert influence as complexity exceeds lay understanding\n    And I identify: warning signs of democratic theater masking technocratic rule\n    And I also find: hopeful pattern of councils resisting capture and demanding explainability\n    And I assess: whether democratic oversight of superintelligence is possible\n    And I conclude: honestly that question remains open\n    And My research frames: humanity's most important governance challenge with intellectual honesty\n",
