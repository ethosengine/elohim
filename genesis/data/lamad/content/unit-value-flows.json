  "content": "# Value Flows: Tracking What Matters\n\n## What Flows Where\n\nEvery day, enormous value flows through your life:\n- Money you earn and spend\n- Time you give and receive\n- Care you provide and accept\n- Knowledge you share and learn\n- Trust you build and draw on\n\nCurrent systems only track the first one.\n\n## The Visibility Problem\n\nWhen value is invisible:\n- **Caregivers burn out**: No recognition, no support\n- **Communities decay**: Social capital isn't measured or maintained\n- **Ecosystems degrade**: Environmental costs aren't counted\n- **Policy fails**: Decisions based on incomplete data\n- **Inequality grows**: Invisible contributions stay unrewarded\n\n## How Value Flows Work\n\n### The Flow Concept\nA value flow is:\n- **What**: The resource that's moving (attention, goods, care, money)\n- **From/To**: The agents involved (people, organizations, communities)\n- **Context**: Why it's happening (exchange, gift, duty, need)\n- **Consequence**: What changes as a result\n\n### Types of Flows\n**Reciprocal Exchange**\n- You give something, you get something\n- Traditional market transaction\n- Also: time banks, skill exchanges, mutual aid\n\n**Gift/Contribution**\n- You give, you don't expect return\n- Donation, volunteering, open source\n- Creates social capital, builds community\n\n**Care/Support**\n- Ongoing relationship of nurture\n- Parenting, eldercare, mentorship\n- Hard to quantify, essential to flourishing\n\n**Extraction/Exploitation**\n- Value taken without adequate return\n- Wage theft, platform extraction, colonialism\n- Making this visible enables resistance\n\n## The ValueFlows Vocabulary\n\nThe Elohim Protocol uses ValueFlows—an open standard for tracking economic activity:\n\n### Core Concepts\n- **Agent**: Who's involved (person, organization, community)\n- **Resource**: What's flowing (goods, services, attention, care)\n- **Event**: What happened (production, consumption, transfer)\n- **Process**: A transformation (teaching, caregiving, manufacturing)\n- **Intent**: A planned action (offer, request, commitment)\n\n### Why Open Standards\n- **Interoperability**: Different communities can share data\n- **Portability**: Your history travels with you\n- **Transparency**: No proprietary black boxes\n- **Community-controlled**: Not owned by any company\n\n## Practical Applications\n\n### Mutual Aid Networks\nTrack who helped whom:\n- \"Maria helped with childcare 4 hours\"\n- \"James provided transportation 3 times\"\n- \"Community garden produced 200 lbs vegetables\"\n\nEnable reciprocity:\n- When Maria needs help, her contributions are visible\n- Community can see gaps and surpluses\n- No one tracks debts; patterns emerge naturally\n\n### Impact Measurement\nMove beyond vanity metrics:\n- Not \"how many meals served\" but \"hunger reduced\"\n- Not \"training hours provided\" but \"skills gained\"\n- Not \"volunteers recruited\" but \"community capacity built\"\n\nTrack what actually matters:\n- Wellbeing outcomes, not just activities\n- Relationship quality, not just transaction counts\n- Ecological regeneration, not just less harm\n\n### Community Currencies\nLocal exchange systems:\n- Backed by community capacity, not central banks\n- Value stays in community\n- Care work becomes exchangeable\n- Visible flows enable trust\n\n## For Policy Makers: Value-Flow-Informed Policy\n\nWhat if policy could see all value flows?\n- Childcare infrastructure investment → measurable care outcomes\n- Small business support → visible local economic circulation\n- Environmental regulation → tracked ecosystem services\n\n### Implementation\n- Require value flow reporting for public contracts\n- Fund infrastructure for community value tracking\n- Integrate care metrics into economic indicators\n- Support interoperable standards\n\n## For Developers: Building Flow Infrastructure\n\nTechnical requirements:\n- **Event logging**: What happened, when, involving whom\n- **Resource tracking**: What exists, where, in what condition\n- **Agent identity**: Consistent across contexts, privacy-preserving\n- **Query interfaces**: Who contributed what to whom when\n- **Visualization**: Make patterns visible and understandable\n\n## For Everyone: Seeing Your Flows\n\nStart noticing the value you create and receive:\n- What did you give today that wasn't compensated?\n- What did you receive that you didn't pay for?\n- Where is value flowing out of your community?\n- What value is invisible that should be recognized?\n\nYour Elohim can help you track and visualize your flows.\n\n## Connection to Recognition\n\nTracking value flows enables recognition. The final unit explores how recognition systems work—how visible value becomes acknowledged value.",
