Community Board Governance for Board Member\n  As a board member serving on a community or neighborhood board in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want hyperlocal data and community input to inform decisions\n  So that I can represent diverse neighborhood interests and connect local needs to broader governance\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the board_member user is registered in the system\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And I am a volunteer serving on neighborhood council, community advisory board, or local school site council\n\n  Scenario: School site council member evaluates school improvement plan priorities\n    Given principal proposes improvement plan focusing on technology upgrades\n    And plan must be approved by site council including parent and teacher representatives\n    And board member wants to ensure plan reflects actual community priorities\n    When the board member requests Observer community input data\n    Then they receive parent survey data showing concerns about class sizes and counseling\n    And see teacher feedback emphasizing professional development needs\n    And access student outcome data showing literacy and math support gaps\n    And discover technology upgrades not mentioned in community feedback\n    And community accountability helps council prioritize authentic local needs\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood council member understands local conditions for district advocacy\n    Given neighborhood has concerns about park maintenance and safety\n    And council wants to advocate to city parks department for improvements\n    And needs data to support request competing with other neighborhoods\n    When the council member uses Observer hyperlocal analysis\n    Then they receive documentation of park condition deterioration over time\n    And see usage data showing high community demand despite poor conditions\n    And access comparison to park investment in other neighborhoods\n    And get demographic analysis showing environmental justice dimensions\n    And hyperlocal data strengthens advocacy to broader governance levels\n\n  Scenario: Community board member tracks implementation of traffic safety improvements\n    Given city committed to traffic calming measures after neighborhood advocacy\n    And board member wants to ensure promises are implemented\n    And community members ask whether improvements are actually happening\n    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking\n    Then they see timeline of committed improvements versus actual installation\n    And discover only partial implementation despite full funding\n    And access traffic incident data showing ongoing safety concerns\n    And find other neighborhoods received promised improvements faster\n    And impact tracking holds city accountable to community commitments\n\n  Scenario: Local advisory board member evaluates community facility needs\n    Given community center requires major renovations or replacement\n    And advisory board must recommend priorities to city council\n    And board wants to understand diverse community facility needs\n    When the board member seeks community input through Observer\n    Then they receive aggregated data on facility usage patterns\n    And see survey responses from various community demographic groups\n    And access needs assessment comparing current offerings to community priorities\n    And discover seniors, youth, and working families have different needs\n    And community accountability helps board advocate for inclusive facility design\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood council member understands displacement pressures in community\n    Given neighborhood experiencing rapid housing cost increases\n    And longtime residents express concerns about ability to stay\n    And council wants to understand scope of displacement threat\n    When the council member uses Observer community impact analysis\n    Then they receive data on rent increases and eviction rates over time\n    And see demographic changes showing displacement patterns\n    And access analysis of displacement risk for different household types\n    And discover specific buildings and blocks with highest vulnerability\n    And hyperlocal data informs advocacy for tenant protections and affordable housing\n\n  Scenario: School site council member advocates for resources from district\n    Given school has aging facilities and overcrowded classrooms\n    And site council wants district to prioritize school for capital improvements\n    And needs to present compelling case competing with other schools\n    When the council member uses Observer to prepare advocacy\n    Then they receive documentation of facility conditions and capacity issues\n    And see comparison to other district schools showing relative needs\n    And access student outcome data linking conditions to learning impacts\n    And get examples of how district allocated capital funds in past\n    And evidence-based advocacy connects community needs to district decisions\n\n  Scenario: Community board member evaluates local business district proposal\n    Given neighborhood association considers supporting business district designation\n    And designation would create additional fees and services\n    And board wants to understand community sentiment and likely impacts\n    When the board member requests Observer analysis\n    Then they receive survey data from local businesses on designation interest\n    And see examples from peer neighborhoods with outcomes and lessons\n    And access analysis of which businesses would benefit versus be burdened\n    And discover resident concerns about gentrification impacts not mentioned by advocates\n    And independent analysis reveals trade-offs beyond promoter presentation\n\n  Scenario: Local board member identifies when community issues require higher-level action\n    Given neighborhood board addresses various community concerns\n    And some issues are within board authority while others require city or district action\n    And board wants to be effective by focusing advocacy appropriately\n    When the board member uses Observer governance layer analysis\n    Then they see which issues are addressable at community level\n    And identify which concerns require municipality or district decisions\n    And access guidance on advocacy strategies for different governance levels\n    And connect to relevant board members at higher governance layers\n    And clear governance mapping makes advocacy more strategic and effective\n",
