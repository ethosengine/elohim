Family Layer Value Recognition for Parent\n  As a parent coordinating care across multiple generations\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want multigenerational care relationships to be visible and reciprocal\n  So that family care economy flows equitably across generations\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the parent user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah's family includes her children Tommy (5) and Emma (8)\n    And Sarah's extended family includes her parents and siblings\n    And Sarah's partner's parents are also involved\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy\n    And care flows in multiple directions across generations\n\n  Scenario: Parent's care work visible across extended family\n    Given Sarah provides care to her children and aging parents\n    And she coordinates between generations\n    When the family_elohim tracks Sarah's care contributions\n    Then her work should be visible to entire extended family\n    And grandparents should see Sarah's parenting labor\n    And siblings should see her coordination work\n    And the full family should recognize her care contributions\n    And visibility should enable family-wide appreciation\n    And Sarah's labor should be valued across all family relationships\n\n  Scenario: Grandparents' childcare contributions recognized and valued\n    Given Sarah's parents provide regular childcare\n    And they help with Tommy and Emma multiple times weekly\n    When the family_elohim tracks grandparent care\n    Then their contributions should be quantified and valued\n    And they should accumulate care tokens for their labor\n    And their work should be recognized as essential family support\n    And grandparents should not be taken for granted\n    And multigenerational care should be reciprocal, not extractive\n    And the system should make grandparent labor visible and valued\n\n  Scenario: Sarah's support for aging parents made visible\n    Given Sarah's parents are aging and need increasing support\n    And Sarah helps with medical appointments, financial planning, household tasks\n    When the family_elohim tracks Sarah's elder care\n    Then it should recognize this as substantial care labor\n    And it should show Sarah is simultaneously caring up and down generations\n    And elder care should accumulate care tokens\n    And the family should see Sarah's sandwich generation burden\n    And her care for aging parents should be valued alongside childcare\n    And multigenerational care should be comprehensive and visible\n\n  Scenario: Family care economy coordinates reciprocity across generations\n    Given Sarah receives childcare support from grandparents\n    And Sarah provides elder care to her aging parents\n    When the family_elohim analyzes care flows\n    Then it should show reciprocal care patterns\n    And it should ensure care is not unidirectionally extractive\n    And it should coordinate so care flows equitably\n    And family relationships should be based on mutual support\n    And the system should enable sustainable multigenerational care\n    And care economy should prevent family exploitation\n\n  Scenario: Teaching children family care economy principles\n    Given Sarah is raising Tommy and Emma in care economy framework\n    And she wants them to understand family care relationships\n    When Sarah teaches children about family care\n    Then the family_elohim should support value literacy education\n    And children should learn that grandparents' help is valuable work\n    And they should understand that Sarah cares for her parents too\n    And they should see care as reciprocal across generations\n    And the next generation should internalize care economy principles\n    And family culture should be transformed through children's education\n\n  Scenario: Family resource allocation based on care contributions\n    Given Sarah contributes enormous care labor to family\n    And family resources are finite\n    When the family makes resource allocation decisions\n    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her standing\n    And her care tokens should influence family governance\n    And those who do care work should have voice in resource decisions\n    And family economics should reflect care economy principles\n    And Sarah should not be economically dependent despite unpaid care work\n    And the system should enable care-based family governance\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating between nuclear and extended family boundaries\n    Given Sarah's household has its own governance\n    And extended family has legitimate interests in children\n    When boundaries between household and extended family are negotiated\n    Then the family_elohim should help navigate appropriate boundaries\n    And it should support Sarah's household autonomy\n    And it should also recognize extended family relationships\n    And boundary negotiations should be care-informed\n    And the system should prevent both isolation and intrusion\n    And healthy multigenerational boundaries should be maintained\n\n  Scenario: Family cultural values transmitted through care practices\n    Given Sarah's family has specific cultural traditions\n    And she wants children to learn their cultural heritage\n    When Sarah practices culturally-specific care\n    Then the family_elohim should recognize cultural value transmission\n    And it should support culturally-appropriate care practices\n    And it should value the work of maintaining cultural identity\n    And cultural education should be recognized as care labor\n    And diverse family cultures should be respected and supported\n    And care economy should serve families' chosen cultural frameworks\n\n  Scenario: Sibling relationships and care coordination\n    Given Sarah's siblings also have care responsibilities\n    And they coordinate care for aging parents\n    When the family_elohim tracks sibling care contributions\n    Then it should show who is doing what for parents\n    And it should prevent care labor from falling unequally on one sibling\n    And it should enable equitable distribution of elder care\n    And sibling relationships should be based on fair care sharing\n    And the system should prevent family dynamics where one child does everything\n    And care economy should create accountability among siblings\n\n  Scenario: Family care during crisis and exceptional needs\n    Given family members sometimes have crisis needs\n    And Sarah might need to care for sick parent or struggling sibling\n    When family crisis occurs\n    Then the family_elohim should coordinate emergency care response\n    And it should show who has capacity to help\n    And it should recognize crisis care as extraordinary contribution\n    And temporary intensive care should be specially valued\n    And the system should enable family mutual aid during crisis\n    And care economy should support family resilience\n\n  Scenario: Blended family and step-family care recognition\n    Given many families include step-parents and half-siblings\n    And Sarah may have step-family relationships\n    When the family_elohim tracks blended family care\n    Then it should recognize care across non-biological relationships\n    And step-parent care should be valued equally\n    And half-sibling care should be recognized\n    And diverse family structures should be fully supported\n    And care economy should serve all family configurations\n    And the system should not privilege nuclear biological family\n\n  Scenario: Family care legacy and intergenerational learning\n    Given Sarah learned caregiving from her own parents\n    And she is teaching care practices to Tommy and Emma\n    When the family_elohim tracks intergenerational patterns\n    Then it should recognize care legacy across generations\n    And it should show how care practices are transmitted\n    And it should value Sarah's role in teaching next generation\n    And intergenerational care knowledge should be recognized\n    And the system should support positive care culture transmission\n    And family care economy should build across generations\n",
