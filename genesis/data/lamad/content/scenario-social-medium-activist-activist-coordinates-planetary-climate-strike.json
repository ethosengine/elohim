  "content": "Given youth activists worldwide demand emergency climate action\nAnd they want coordinated strikes across all continents\nWhen the network establishes a coordinated action date\nAnd local groups plan context-appropriate actions\nAnd the coordination respects different hemispheres, cultures, and capacities\nThen each community organizes autonomously within global framework\nAnd the translation agents enable real-time cross-language coordination\nAnd traditional media amplification is earned through demonstrated scale\nAnd the collective action maintains coherence without centralized control\nAnd impact is measured through network-wide participation tracking\nAnd the strike demonstrates viable model for global coordination",
