  "content": "Scenario: Balancing neighborhood participation with student time constraints\n    Given Kenji has limited time between school and work\n    And neighborhood participation requires time investment\n    When the neighborhood_elohim helps Kenji manage participation\n    Then it should help him identify high-impact, low-time contributions\n    And it should validate that he can't participate in everything\n    And it should show: \"30 minutes at neighborhood meeting = valuable contribution\"\n    And participation should be realistic for student schedules\n    And the system should enable partial participation as valid\n    And students should participate at sustainable levels\n",
