  "content": "Scenario: Drafting Community AI Infrastructure Act for national funding\n    Given poor communities nationwide need infrastructure support\n    And I want equitable protocol access\n    When I draft national funding legislation\n    Then I provide: grants for community nodes and maintenance\n    And I fund: research evaluating protocol outcomes\n    And I support: technical assistance for poor communities\n    And I establish: sliding scale and cross-subsidization\n    And I treat: democratic AI governance as public infrastructure\n    And I defend: against claims of \"picking winners\"\n    And I argue: this enables democracy not market manipulation\n",
