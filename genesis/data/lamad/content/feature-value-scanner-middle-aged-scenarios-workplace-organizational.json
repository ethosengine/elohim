Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult\n  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want my care responsibilities recognized as enhancing rather than hindering my professional capability\n  So that I can advocate for care-friendly workplace policies and leverage my care skills professionally\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the middle-aged user \"Robert\" is registered in the system\n    And Robert is 52 years old working as mid-level manager\n    And he manages substantial family care responsibilities while maintaining professional standing\n    And the workplace governance context is active\n    And workplace_elohim monitors work conditions and advocates for care economy principles\n    And Robert has influence over workplace policy in his leadership position\n\n  Scenario: Care skills recognized as professional assets\n    Given Robert has developed sophisticated coordination, resource management, and emotional intelligence through care work\n    And these skills directly enhance his professional capability\n    And traditional workplaces don't recognize care skills as professional qualifications\n    When workplace_elohim analyzes Robert's professional capabilities\n    Then it should make visible how care work develops professional skills\n    And recognize that coordinating multigenerational care builds management capability\n    And surface: \"Your care coordination skills enhance your project management effectiveness\"\n    And help Robert articulate care skills in professional contexts\n    And advocate that care experience should be valued in performance reviews\n    And demonstrate that care responsibilities enhance rather than diminish professional capability\n    And build workplace culture that recognizes care as skill development\n\n  Scenario: Workplace flexibility negotiated for elder care emergencies\n    Given Robert's parents ages 78 and 75 have occasional health emergencies\n    And he needs workplace flexibility to respond to care crises\n    And his professional position gives him standing to negotiate\n    When workplace_elohim supports flexibility negotiation\n    Then it should help Robert advocate for flexible work arrangements\n    And provide data about productivity maintenance with flexibility\n    And support him in negotiating remote work options for care emergencies\n    And help him demonstrate that flexibility enables sustainable high performance\n    And build workplace policy that accommodates care emergencies\n    And prevent him from choosing between professional standing and family care\n    And demonstrate that care-friendly workplaces benefit employer and employee\n\n  Scenario: Care leave policies advocated based on personal experience\n    Given Robert has navigated inadequate care leave policies\n    And he knows what workplace support caregivers need\n    And his leadership position enables policy advocacy\n    When workplace_elohim supports policy advocacy\n    Then it should help Robert advocate for expanded care leave\n    And provide evidence about care leave benefits for retention and productivity\n    And connect him to policy development processes\n    And support him in proposing paid family leave, elder care leave, and flexible care arrangements\n    And build workplace policy that supports employees' care responsibilities\n    And leverage his experience and standing for systemic improvement\n    And demonstrate that middle managers can drive workplace transformation\n\n  Scenario: Performance evaluation recognizes whole-person contribution\n    Given Robert's professional performance should be evaluated fairly\n    And care responsibilities shouldn't be seen as professional liability\n    And his care skills enhance his professional effectiveness\n    When workplace_elohim supports performance evaluation\n    Then it should advocate for evaluation that recognizes whole-person contribution\n    And help Robert articulate how care responsibilities develop professional capability\n    And surface when evaluation processes penalize caregiving\n    And support him in documenting productivity and value creation\n    And build evaluation frameworks that value care skills\n    And prevent caregivers from being passed over for advancement\n    And demonstrate that fair evaluation includes care economy perspective\n\n  Scenario: Workplace culture shift through middle management advocacy\n    Given Robert has influence as mid-level manager\n    And workplace culture often penalizes care responsibilities\n    And middle managers can model care-friendly leadership\n    When workplace_elohim supports culture change\n    Then it should help Robert model care economy principles in his management\n    And support him in being transparent about his care responsibilities\n    And help him advocate for team members' care needs\n    And build workplace culture where care is normalized rather than hidden\n    And demonstrate that managers can lead cultural transformation\n    And create workplace environment where caregiving is supported\n    And leverage his position for systemic culture change\n\n  Scenario: Mentoring and leadership valued as care contribution\n    Given Robert mentors junior employees and provides leadership\n    And workplace mentoring is care work\n    And his leadership develops others' capabilities\n    When workplace_elohim recognizes workplace care contributions\n    Then it should value Robert's mentoring as care economy participation\n    And track his contributions: mentoring relationships, team development, organizational leadership\n    And recognize that developing others is care for people and organization\n    And demonstrate that leadership is care work\n    And value workplace care contributions in care token economy\n    And build understanding that all work includes care dimensions\n    And integrate workplace care with broader care economy participation\n\n  Scenario: Work-life boundaries protected to prevent burnout\n    Given Robert manages intense professional and care demands\n    And work can expand to consume all available time\n    And sustainable performance requires work-life boundaries\n    When workplace_elohim monitors work-life balance\n    Then it should track whether Robert maintains healthy boundaries\n    And flag when work demands prevent care responsibilities\n    And recognize when he's working excessive hours despite care needs\n    And support him in setting professional boundaries\n    And advocate for organizational norms that respect whole life\n    And prevent burnout that would harm him, his family, and employer\n    And demonstrate that sustainable high performance requires balance\n\n  Scenario: Career advancement pathways accommodate care responsibilities\n    Given Robert has capacity for career advancement\n    And traditional advancement often requires sacrificing care\n    And career paths should

provide advancement without unsustainable burden\n    And advocate for flexible advancement pathways\n    And support him in negotiating advancement terms that honor his full life\n    And build career structures that don't force choice between advancement and care\n    And demonstrate that talented employees shouldn't have to choose\n    And create advancement pathways compatible with care economy\n\n  Scenario: Organizational care economy consulting based on lived experience\n    Given Robert has decades of experience managing work and care\n    And organizations need care economy

experience\n    And channel his wisdom toward organizational transformation\n\n  Scenario: Workplace advocacy coordinates with other caregiving employees\n    Given Robert works with other employees managing care responsibilities\n    And collective advocacy is more effective than individual negotiation\n    And workplace care economy benefits all caregiving employees\n    When workplace_elohim
