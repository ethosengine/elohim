Individual-Level Appeal Process for Appellant\n  As an appellant in the governance system\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want to appeal AI agent decisions that affect my personal autonomy and dignity\n  So that I have meaningful recourse and my voice is heard in decisions that govern me\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the appellant user is registered in the system\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And I have the right to appeal any agent decision that affects me\n\n  Scenario: Appeal mental health intervention with privacy concerns\n    Given my Family Elohim has alerted my partner about concerning behavioral changes\n    And I believe this is an invasion of my privacy\n    And I was not in immediate danger\n    When I file an appeal through my interface\n    And I state my complaint in my own words: \"This felt like surveillance\"\n    Then the appeal is immediately logged with timestamp and cryptographic proof\n    And I receive confirmation with appeal tracking number\n    And the agent provides its full reasoning transparently\n    And I can see the pattern detection logic, confidence levels, and constitutional weighting\n    And the appeal is scheduled for Community Elohim review within 24 hours\n    And I am notified of my rights including escalation options\n\n  Scenario: Understanding agent reasoning through appeal process\n    Given I have filed an appeal against a Family Elohim decision\n    And I don't understand why the agent made its choice\n    When I request detailed explanation through the appeal interface\n    Then I receive layered explanations from plain language to technical detail\n    And I can see the constitutional principles the agent applied\n    And I can view counterfactual scenarios showing what would change the outcome\n    And I can access the cryptographic proof trail\n    And Technical experts are available to explain complex aspects if needed\n    And all explanations are in accessible language without jargon\n\n  Scenario: Successfully overturning an agent decision through appeal\n    Given I appealed a personal autonomy decision\n    And the Constitutional Council has reviewed my case\n    When the council rules that the agent overstepped constitutional bounds\n    Then the agent's decision is immediately overturned\n    And my preferences are updated automatically in the system\n    And the incident is documented as an error in the agent's record\n    And Similar future interventions require higher thresholds\n    And I receive notification of the outcome with full reasoning\n    And Protocol improvements are proposed based on my case\n\n  Scenario: Appeal unsuccessful but feeling heard through the process\n    Given I filed an appeal about a life-saving intervention I felt was invasive\n    And the Constitutional Council has deliberated on my case\n    When the council affirms the agent's decision as constitutionally aligned\n    But also recommends protocol enhancements for pre-specified preferences\n    Then I receive detailed explanation of why the decision was upheld\n    And I can see how my appeal influenced protocol improvements\n    And I am offered support to update my future preferences\n    And My dissent is honored and recorded even though I didn't win\n    And I understand my voice mattered in making the system better\n\n  Scenario: Escalating appeal when initial review doesn't satisfy\n    Given my Community Elohim review upheld the original decision\n    And I still believe my constitutional rights were violated\n    When I choose to escalate to peer agent review\n    Then three randomly-selected Family Elohim agents from other families review my case\n    And A Constitutional Council observer monitors the peer review\n    And The peer agents investigate deeper than the original review\n    And They can override, modify, or affirm the original decision\n    And I receive their judgment within one week\n    And I retain the right to escalate further to Constitutional Council if needed\n\n  Scenario: Accessing precedent to understand similar cases\n    Given I am considering filing an appeal\n    And I want to understand how similar cases were decided\n    When I search the precedent database for \"mental health intervention + privacy\"\n    Then I can see anonymized cases with constitutional reasoning\n    And I can view outcomes and protocol changes that resulted\n    And I can see success rates for different appeal types\n    And I can understand the constitutional framework being applied\n    And This helps me calibrate my expectations and build my appeal argument\n\n  Scenario: Pre-specifying preferences after successful appeal\n    Given my appeal was resolved and I gained the right to set preferences\n    When I access my preference settings through the interface\n    Then I can specify alert preferences for future interventions\n    And I can set thresholds like \"family alert only after three-day pattern\"\n    And I can balance my privacy needs with care considerations\n    And The agent respects my preferences in future decisions\n    And I feel ownership over my own protection rather than being controlled\n\n  Scenario: Protection from retaliation after filing appeal\n    Given I filed an appeal that challenged an agent's authority\n    And I was concerned about potential retaliation in future decisions\n    When I continue interacting with Elohim agents after my appeal\n    Then the appeal cannot be used against me in future decisions\n    And Agents do not punish me for exercising my right to appeal\n    And The system monitors for retaliatory patterns\n    And I have recourse if I detect bias based on my appeal history\n    And My right to dissent is protected as fundamental to the protocol\n\n  Scenario: Accessing appeals process without technical expertise\n    Given I am not tech-savvy and don't understand AI systems well\n    And an agent decision has affected me in a way I disagree with\n    When I want to file an appeal\n    Then I can trigger the appeal with a simple button: \"I disagree with this decision\"\n    And I can state my complaint in plain language without legal jargon\n    And I don't need a lawyer or technical knowledge to participate\n    And The interface guides me through the process step-by-step\n    And Support is available in my language and accessible format\n    And The process respects my dignity regardless of my technical literacy\n\n  Scenario: Appeal contributes to constitutional evolution\n    Given my appeal revealed a fundamental gap in the constitutional framework\n    And the Constitutional Council identified this as a recurring issue\n    When the council documents recommendations for protocol improvement\n    Then my case becomes input for the next 7-year Constitutional Convention\n    And My lived experience of feeling violated despite life-saving intervention\n    And This helps shape how care and autonomy are balanced at constitutional level\n    And I can see the long-term impact of my appeal beyond my individual case\n    And My suffering wasn't wasted\u2014it made the system better for everyone\n",
