Your care matters.\"\n    And his care contributions should be recognized immediately\n    And he should understand that caring for others is valuable work\n    And foundational belief that care has worth should be established\n    And this teaching should precede any exposure to market economics\n\n  Scenario: Learning agency within appropriate boundaries\n    Given Tommy needs to develop healthy sense of agency\n    And he also needs safety and guidance\n    When Tommy makes choices in the Value Scanner\n    Then he should experience genuine decision-making power\n    And he should learn that his choices have real consequences\n    And he should discover natural limits through experience\n    And boundaries should teach safety, not powerlessness\n    And he should learn both capability and humility\n\n  Scenario: Educational design prevents formation of consumer identity\n    Given consumer capitalism targets children for identity formation\n    And Tommy is highly vulnerable to conditioning\n    When Tommy learns through the Value Scanner\n    Then no gamification should train extraction thinking\n    And no points systems should create achievement addiction\n    And no rewards should condition consumption behavior\n    And identity formation should center on care, not acquisition\n    And Tommy should learn to see himself as contributor, not consumer\n\n  Scenario: Teaching reciprocity and mutual care through experience\n    Given Tommy is learning social and moral concepts\n    And reciprocity is foundational to care economy\n    When Tommy both gives and receives care through the scanner\n    Then he should learn that care flows in multiple directions\n    And he should experience receiving recognition for his care\n    And he should practice recognizing others' care for him\n    And reciprocal care patterns should be modeled\n    And mutual flourishing should be taught through practice\n\n  Scenario: Early childhood education policies inform pedagogical approach\n    Given educational governance includes early childhood development research\n    And evidence-based practices exist for ages 5-7\n    When the personal_agent's pedagogy is configured\n    Then it should incorporate developmental psychology research\n    And it should follow evidence-based early learning principles\n    And it should respect limits of cognitive development at age 5\n    And it should support optimal development trajectories\n    And educational policy should shape how Tommy is taught\n\n  Scenario: Learning that contributes to community knowledge without exploitation\n    Given Tommy's learning patterns generate educational data\n    And this data could improve pedagogy for other children\n    When Tommy's anonymized learning data is collected\n    Then it must only be used to improve educational outcomes\n    And Tommy's privacy must be absolutely protected\n    And no commercial exploitation of learning data should occur\n    And data should serve collective learning, not surveillance capitalism\n    And Tommy's education must never be monetized\n\n  Scenario: Foundation for lifelong value literacy begins at age 5\n    Given Tommy is forming foundational beliefs about economics\n    And early learning shapes lifelong patterns\n    When Tommy completes the Pure Discovery phase\n    Then he should have internalized that care creates value\n    And he should understand that his choices matter to others\n    And he should experience himself as capable care contributor\n    And he should expect technology to serve human flourishing\n    And he should have alternative to consumer capitalism as baseline\n    And his generation should grow up assuming care economy is normal\n\n  Scenario: Teaching includes ecological care appropriate to age\n    Given care economy extends beyond human relationships\n    And environmental stewardship is part of value literacy\n    When Tommy learns about care through the scanner\n    Then ecological care should be introduced at concrete level\n    And Tommy should learn \"Taking care of our food\" (not abstract sustainability)\n    And connections between care for people and care for environment should begin\n    And age-appropriate environmental consciousness should develop\n    And foundations for ecological stewardship should be laid\n\n  Scenario: Voice guidance ensures accessibility for pre-readers\n    Given Tommy is 5 and may have limited reading ability\n    And accessibility is required for equitable education\n    When Tommy uses the educational features of the scanner\n    Then voice guidance should be available throughout\n    And visual feedback should be primary\n    And no reading ability should be required for core functionality\n    And audio should be warm, encouraging, and developmentally appropriate\n    And the system should be accessible to all children regardless of reading level\n",
