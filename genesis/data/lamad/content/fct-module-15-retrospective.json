Discuss:\n\nHow do these insights reflect our calling as \"digital disciples\"?  \nWhere do we see opportunities to be \"salt and light\" in the tech world?\n\nDecide What to Do (20 minutes)  \nIndividually, then in pairs, create action plans addressing:\n\nOne immediate change you'll make in your personal tech habits  \nOne initiative you'll start or join in your church/community related to humane technology  \nOne way you'll advocate for more Christ-centered approaches in your professional tech engagement\n\nClose the Retrospective (15 minutes)\n\nEach person shares their top action item with the larger group  \nCollectively, create a \"Digital Discipleship Manifesto\" – a short list of commitments the group is making to steward technology in a way that honors God and serves humanity\n\nClosing Prayer (5 minutes)  \nEnd with a prayer of commissioning, asking for God's strength and guidance as we go forth to act on our learnings.\n\nFollow-up:  \nEncourage participants to share their action plans with an accountability partner from the course. Schedule a follow-up session in 1-3 months to check in on progress and share stories of impact.  \nThis activity allows participants to synthesize their learning, connect it directly to their faith and daily lives, and create concrete plans for action. It embodies the \"Ready to Act\" theme while incorporating elements of reflection, community sharing, and forward-looking planning – all crucial components for turning learning into real-world impact.\n\n",
