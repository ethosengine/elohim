Provincial/State-Level Policy Making for AI Governance\n  As a policy_maker in the governance system\n  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer\n  I want to create enabling legislation for democratic AI governance\n  So that protocol serves communities while integrating with existing law\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the policy_maker user is registered in the system\n    And the provincial_state governance context is active\n    And Senator Elena Ruiz chairs state AI governance committee\n\n  Scenario: Crafting enabling legislation protecting protocol sovereignty\n    Given I want to support democratic AI governance\n    And I must integrate protocol with existing state law\n    When I draft AI governance legislation\n    Then I create: legal recognition of Constitutional Council authority\n    And I establish: state funding for community protocol infrastructure\n    And I mandate: interoperability between government systems and protocol\n    And I protect: communities from corporate capture attempts\n    And I ensure: equitable access for poor communities\n    And my legislation: enables rather than controls protocol\n    And I empower: community sovereignty within legal framework\n\n  Scenario: Using research evidence to justify protocol support\n    Given I need to defend protocol against skeptical colleagues\n    And Dr. Chen's research provides rigorous evaluation\n    When I cite evidence in committee hearings\n    Then I present: data showing reduced loneliness and improved wellbeing\n    And I provide: evidence about successful crisis response\n    And I demonstrate: marginalized community access patterns\n    And I show: comparison with communities without protocol\n    And I address: limitations and challenges honestly\n    And evidence base: supports informed policy choice\n    And I maintain: scientific credibility through honest assessment\n\n  Scenario: Hearing testimony from Mayor Jamal about implementation reality\n    Given I need ground truth about protocol in practice\n    And Riverside provides three years of experience\n    When Mayor Jamal testifies about community implementation\n    Then he shares: what works (community calibration, constitutional oversight)\n    And he describes: what struggles (elderly accessibility, controversy)\n    And he explains: factors predicting adoption success\n    And he provides: evidence countering corporate lobbyist claims\n    And his testimony: grounds policy in lived reality\n    And I learn: from practitioners not just theory\n    And community voices: inform state legislation\n\n  Scenario: Resisting corporate lobbying for regulatory capture\n    Given tech companies lobby for regulations favoring incumbents\n    And they push: backdoor mandates, centralization requirements, licensing barriers\n    When I defend protocol sovereignty against capture\n    Then I use: cryptographic impossibility arguments (backdoors break verification)\n    And I present: evidence that regulation would harm innovation\n    And I coalition: with community leaders showing grassroots opposition\n    And I reference: international examples of protocol sovereignty working\n    And I require: transparency about lobbying and funding\n    And I resist: well-funded pressure through political courage\n    And I protect: democratic governance from corporate control\n\n  Scenario: Establishing legal recognition of Constitutional Council decisions\n    Given courts need to know how to treat council precedents\n    And government agencies must understand council authority\n    When I craft legislation recognizing council legitimacy\n    Then I establish: statutory basis for council decisions\n    And I specify: courts recognize precedents in protocol-related cases\n    And I ensure: agencies defer to council constitutional interpretation\n    And I maintain: judicial review for constitutional questions\n    And I create: legal framework for sortition governance\n    And councils gain: legitimacy within existing legal system\n    And new democratic form: integrates with traditional structures\n\n  Scenario: Funding state grants for community protocol adoption\n    Given poor communities cannot afford protocol infrastructure\n    And equitable access requires public investment\n    When I secure state budget allocation for protocol support\n    Then I fund: grants for community nodes and maintenance\n    And I support: accessibility enhancements and education\n    And I provide: technical assistance for implementation\n    And I ensure: sliding scale and cross-subsidization\n    And I treat: protocol as democracy infrastructure deserving investment\n    And I prevent: digital divide excluding marginalized communities\n    And public funding: enables universal access to democratic governance tools\n\n  Scenario: Addressing protocol-tax law integration questions\n    Given protocol creates novel economic relationships\n    And tax implications are unclear\n    When I work with revenue department on clarification\n    Then we determine: tax treatment of care tokens\n    And we address: property tax implications of resource sharing\n    And we clarify: whether mutual aid counts for social safety net\n    And we create: certainty enabling protocol to function\n    And we avoid: creating impossible tax burdens\n    And we ensure: tax policy doesn't undermine protocol benefits\n    And legal clarity: supports implementation\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating interstate recognition of protocol decisions\n    Given protocol operates across state boundaries\n    And consistency is needed for coordination\n    When I work on interstate compact for protocol recognition\n    Then we establish: mutual recognition of council decisions across states\n    And we create: conflict resolution mechanisms for disputes\n    And we maintain: state sovereignty and variation\n    And we enable: coordination without centralization\n    And we show: federalism working for AI governance\n    And states cooperate: while preserving local autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Responding to constituent concerns about AI governance\n    Given residents contact me about protocol experiences\n    And I am accountable through elections\n    When I maintain constituent engagement on AI governance\n    Then I hold: town halls in communities like Riverside\n    And I offer: office hours for people like Marcus to share experiences\n    And I conduct: surveys gathering feedback on legislation\n    And I respond: to concerns showing I'm listening\n    And I maintain: constituent services for protocol-related issues\n    And I remain: democratically accountable for policy choices\n\n  Scenario: Establishing liability framework for agent errors\n    Given agents will make mistakes\n    And someone must address harms\n    When I create liability and accountability legislation\n    Then I establish: protocol insurance pool for errors\n    And I specify: remedies for different types of mistakes\n    And I require: immediate correction and compensation\n    And I penalize: bad-faith attempts to corrupt agents\n    And I balance: accountability with innovation\n    And framework: enables learning from mistakes\n    And responsibility: is clear without stifling development\n\n  Scenario: Mandating transparency while protecting privacy\n    Given public needs visibility into protocol governance\n    And individuals need privacy protection\n    When I craft transparency requirements\n    Then I require: appeal outcomes and patterns be public\n    And I mandate: constitutional council precedents accessible\n    And I ensure: individual data privacy through anonymization\n    And I specify: security audit results must be disclosed\n    And I balance: transparency serving accountability with privacy protection\n    And requirements: enable democratic oversight without surveillance\n\n  Scenario: Learning from protocol outcomes to improve legislation\n    Given Constitutional Convention passed adolescent autonomy amendment\n    And this reflects accumulated precedents and appeals\n    When I translate constitutional evolution into state law\n    Then I craft: legislation operationalizing the amendment\n    And I update: state family law to reflect constitutional principle\n    And I modify: education policy honoring developing autonomy\n    And constitutional evolution: informs statutory law\n    And I demonstrate: how different democratic forms work together\n",
