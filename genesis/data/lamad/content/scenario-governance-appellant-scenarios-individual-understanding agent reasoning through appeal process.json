  "content": "Scenario: Understanding agent reasoning through appeal process\n    Given I have filed an appeal against a Family Elohim decision\n    And I don't understand why the agent made its choice\n    When I request detailed explanation through the appeal interface\n    Then I receive layered explanations from plain language to technical detail\n    And I can see the constitutional principles the agent applied\n    And I can view counterfactual scenarios showing what would change the outcome\n    And I can access the cryptographic proof trail\n    And Technical experts are available to explain complex aspects if needed\n    And all explanations are in accessible language without jargon\n",
