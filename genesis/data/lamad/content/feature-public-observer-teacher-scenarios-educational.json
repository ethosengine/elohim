Education Policy and Professional Expertise for Teacher\n  As a teacher in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want to center professional expertise in education decisions\n  So that education policy serves student learning not bureaucratic compliance\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teacher user is registered in the system\n    And the educational governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Teacher grounds curriculum debate in professional knowledge\n    Given the school board debates curriculum approaches\n    And discussion is dominated by political ideology not educational evidence\n    When teachers contribute professional expertise through Observer\n    Then board receives aggregated teacher insights on effective curriculum\n    And teachers provide research evidence on curriculum approaches\n    And share classroom examples of what actually works for students\n    And connect curriculum to actual student learning outcomes\n    And education policy discussion becomes evidence-based and professional\n\n  Scenario: Teacher exposes gap between policy rhetoric and classroom reality\n    Given administrators promote new \"personalized learning\" initiative\n    And claim technology will revolutionize teaching\n    When teachers document actual implementation through Observer\n    Then teachers show \"personalized learning\" means students on computers alone\n    And reduced human interaction and teacher-student relationships\n    And technology substitutes for reduced staffing\n    And student engagement declining not improving\n    And teacher evidence reveals policy rhetoric vs learning reality\n\n  Scenario: Teacher connects resource allocation to learning outcomes\n    Given district allocates resources based on administrative priorities\n    And claims all schools receive equitable support\n    When teachers document resource-outcome patterns through Observer\n    Then teachers show schools with counselors have better student wellbeing\n    And smaller class sizes correlate with better learning outcomes\n    And arts programs predict higher engagement and graduation rates\n    And teacher professional judgment is validated by student outcome data\n    And resource allocation becomes student-centered not administratively convenient\n\n  Scenario: Teacher advocates for evidence-based special education practices\n    Given students with learning differences need specialized support\n    And current special education approach is compliance-focused not learning-focused\n    When teachers coordinate around special education reform through Observer\n    Then teachers document what actually helps students with diverse needs\n    And share successful inclusive practices across schools\n    And identify barriers to effective special education (caseloads, resources, training)\n    And build coalition with parents of students with disabilities\n    And special education becomes about student learning not just paperwork\n\n  Scenario: Teacher challenges standardized assessment overemphasis\n    Given standardized testing dominates education policy decisions\n    And teachers know tests measure narrow slice of learning\n    When teachers provide professional perspective on assessment through Observer\n    Then teachers show how test prep narrows curriculum and reduces rich learning\n    And document student stress and declining engagement with testing\n    And present comprehensive assessment approaches that inform teaching\n    And build parent coalition around learning-centered not test-centered education\n    And assessment policy reflects professional expertise about student learning\n\n  Scenario: Teacher informs early literacy policy with classroom expertise\n    Given state mandates specific reading instruction approach\n    And approach contradicts teacher professional knowledge and research\n    When teachers document reading instruction reality through Observer\n    Then teachers show mandated approach doesn't work for all students\n    And provide evidence on effective literacy practices for diverse learners\n    And document student reading outcomes under different approaches\n    And coordinate with literacy researchers and reading specialists\n    And reading policy becomes informed by professional expertise not ideology\n\n  Scenario: Teacher reveals disciplinary policy impacts on students\n    Given district implements zero-tolerance discipline policy\n    And claims it improves school safety and learning environment\n    When teachers track disciplinary policy impacts through Observer\n    Then teachers document disproportionate impact on students of color\n    And show suspensions increase rather than decrease behavior issues\n    And demonstrate how exclusionary discipline harms student learning\n    And propose restorative practices as evidence-based alternative\n    And disciplinary policy becomes educational equity issue\n\n  Scenario: Teacher builds parent-teacher coalition for education quality\n    Given parents and teachers share commitment to student learning\n    But often lack coordination around education policy\n    When the Observer facilitates parent-teacher alignment\n    Then teachers share professional insights on education policy impacts\n    And parents provide family perspective on student experiences\n    And shared analysis reveals common interests (smaller classes, arts, counselors)\n    And parent-teacher coalition advocates together to decision-makers\n    And cross-stakeholder solidarity transforms education advocacy power\n",
