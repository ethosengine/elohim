  "content": "Scenario: Maintaining neighborhood relationships across class differences\n    Given Margaret has limited income but middle-class background\n    And the neighborhood may have economic diversity\n    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates connections\n    Then Margaret should be connected across economic boundaries\n    And her value should not depend on financial resources\n    And care contributions should create cross-class solidarity\n    And the neighborhood should value all members' contributions\n    And economic diversity should strengthen rather than divide\n    And Margaret's care economy participation should bridge differences\n",
