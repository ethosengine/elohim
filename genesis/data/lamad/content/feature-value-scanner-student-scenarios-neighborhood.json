Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Student\n  As a student living temporarily in a college neighborhood\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want to participate in local care economy as real community member\n  So that I build belonging and contribute to neighborhood flourishing now\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the student user \"Kenji\" is registered in the system\n    And Kenji lives in a college neighborhood\n    And Kenji's residency is temporary (likely leaving after graduation)\n    And the neighborhood includes students and long-term residents\n    And Kenji shops locally and walks the neighborhood daily\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim could coordinate local care economy\n\n  Scenario: Student recognized as real neighborhood member despite temporary status\n    Given Kenji will likely move after graduation\n    And neighborhoods often treat students as temporary non-members\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks neighborhood participation\n    Then it should recognize students as current, real residents\n    And it should value Kenji's presence now, not discount it as temporary\n    And it should include him in neighborhood decision-making\n    And temporary residency should not exclude from community membership\n    And the system should counteract student marginalization\n    And Kenji should experience genuine neighborhood belonging\n\n  Scenario: Shopping locally contributes to neighborhood economy\n    Given Kenji buys groceries at neighborhood corner store and farmer's market\n    And local shopping supports neighborhood businesses\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks local economic participation\n    Then it should recognize Kenji's local purchases as neighborhood contribution\n    And it should show him \"You've spent $X at local businesses this month\"\n    And it should help him understand his economic impact on neighborhood\n    And local shopping should accumulate care tokens\n    And the system should make visible how spending choices support community\n    And students should see themselves as neighborhood economic participants\n\n  Scenario: Navigating student-resident tensions in shared neighborhood\n    Given long-term residents might resent student noise, parties, or turnover\n    And students might be unaware of neighborhood norms\n    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates student-resident relationships\n    Then it should educate students about neighborhood expectations\n    And it should help residents recognize students as temporary but real members\n    And it should facilitate communication between students and long-term residents\n    And it should build understanding across different neighborhood groups\n    And the system should reduce student-resident conflict\n    And mixed neighborhoods should be navigable for all residents\n\n  Scenario: Participating in neighborhood care economy with limited resources\n    Given Kenji has severe resource constraints\n    And he cannot contribute financially to neighborhood projects\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks care contributions\n    Then it should recognize non-financial contributions Kenji can make\n    And it should value his labor, time, and presence\n    And it should show \"Kenji helped neighbor carry groceries: 2 care tokens\"\n    And participation should not require money\n    And the system should enable care economy participation at all resource levels\n    And students should contribute to neighborhood based on capacity\n\n  Scenario: Learning neighborhood as governance unit\n    Given Kenji is learning how communities function\n    And neighborhood is often invisible as governance layer\n    When the personal_agent teaches Kenji about neighborhood governance\n    Then it should help him see neighborhood as care coordination unit\n    And it should show how neighborhoods make collective decisions\n    And it should teach him that geography creates shared stakes\n    And neighborhood should be understood as governance layer\n    And the system should build Kenji's civic literacy\n    And students should learn that neighborhoods govern local flourishing\n\n  Scenario: Connecting to neighborhood resources appropriate for students\n    Given Kenji has limited budget and might face emergencies\n    And neighborhoods often have resources (food banks, tool libraries, mutual aid)\n    When the neighborhood_elohim connects Kenji to resources\n    Then it should inform him of neighborhood food bank access\n    And it should show shared resources: \"Neighborhood tool library 3 blocks away\"\n    And it should reduce barriers to accessing community support\n    And it should normalize resource sharing as care economy\n    And the system should connect students to neighborhood safety nets\n    And resource access should be dignified and easy\n\n  Scenario: Student contribution to neighborhood safety and mutual care\n    Given Kenji walks neighborhood streets regularly\n    And neighborhood safety is collective responsibility\n    When Kenji participates in neighborhood mutual care\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize his watchfulness\n    And it should value informal safety contributions: checking on neighbors, reporting issues\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for neighborhood care work\n    And students should be recognized as safety contributors, not threats\n    And the system should value informal mutual aid\n    And neighborhood care should be understood as everyone's work\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood environmental stewardship\n    Given Kenji is studying environmental science\n    And neighborhoods are environmental governance units\n    When Kenji participates in neighborhood environmental care\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize his stewardship work\n    And it should value his participation in neighborhood cleanup\n    And it should recognize his knowledge contributions about sustainability\n    And environmental care should accumulate care tokens\n    And the system should connect academic learning to neighborhood action\n    And students should contribute environmental expertise to neighborhoods\n\n  Scenario: Building neighborhood relationships across demographic differences\n    Given Kenji's neighborhood includes diverse ages, incomes, and backgrounds\n    And care economy requires bridging difference\n    When Kenji builds relationships with non-student neighbors\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize cross-demographic care work\n    And it should value relationships with elderly neighbors, families, workers\n    And it should show how diverse relationships strengthen neighborhood\n    And bridging work should be recognized as care contribution\n    And the system should foster inclusive neighborhood community\n    And students should learn to build community across difference\n\n  Scenario: Temporary residency patterns and neighborhood turnover\n    Given student neighborhoods have high turnover\n    And institutional knowledge is lost with each cohort\n    When the neighborhood_elohim manages turnover\n    Then it should preserve neighborhood practices across student generations\n    And it should help new students learn neighborhood norms quickly\n    And it should maintain neighborhood continuity despite turnover\n    And transient residents should still build lasting neighborhood patterns\n    And the system should stabilize high-turnover neighborhoods\n    And neighborhood culture should persist beyond individual residents\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood as site for practicing civic participation\n    Given Kenji is learning how democratic participation works\n    And neighborhood is most accessible governance layer\n    When Kenji participates in neighborhood meetings or decisions\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize civic participation as care work\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for attending meetings, voting on issues\n    And it should teach him that democracy requires participation labor\n    And civic work should be valued as care economy contribution\n    And the system should build habits of democratic participation\n    And students should practice civic engagement at neighborhood scale\n\n  Scenario: Balancing neighborhood participation with student time constraints\n    Given Kenji has limited time between school and work\n    And neighborhood participation requires time investment\n    When the neighborhood_elohim helps Kenji manage participation\n    Then it should help him identify high-impact, low-time contributions\n    And it should validate that he can't participate in everything\n    And it should show: \"30 minutes at neighborhood meeting = valuable contribution\"\n    And participation should be realistic for student schedules\n    And the system should enable partial participation as valid\n    And students should participate at sustainable levels\n",
