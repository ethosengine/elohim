  "content": "Scenario: Neighborhood connection across economic differences\n    Given the neighborhood includes families at different income levels\n    And economic inequality can divide communities\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates care economy\n    Then it should enable connection across economic differences\n    And care tokens should provide support to lower-income families\n    And resource sharing should reduce economic barriers\n    And neighborhood cooperation should reduce inequality impacts\n    And mixed-income community should be strengthened\n    And the system should build solidarity, not division\n",
