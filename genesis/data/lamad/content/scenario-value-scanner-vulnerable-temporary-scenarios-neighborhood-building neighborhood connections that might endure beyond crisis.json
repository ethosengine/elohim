  "content": "Scenario: Building neighborhood connections that might endure beyond crisis\n    Given I might move to permanent housing in this neighborhood or elsewhere\n    And relationships I build now could become long-term community\n    When I invest in neighborhood relationships\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me identify connections worth developing\n    And supports authentic relationship-building despite uncertainty\n    And validates that building community is valuable regardless of housing permanence\n    And helps me maintain connections if I move within neighborhood\n    And facilitates staying connected if I move to different neighborhood\n    And my personal_agent tracks meaningful neighborhood relationships\n    And recognizes community-building as important social infrastructure work\n    And celebrates relationships that provide support and belonging\n",
