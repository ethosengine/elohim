Individual Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent\n  As a single parent managing solo household responsibilities\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want to maintain personal autonomy and identity despite overwhelming care demands\n  So that I can sustain myself while providing superhuman care for my family\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the single parent user \"Maria\" is registered in the system\n    And Maria is a 38-year-old single mother of three children (ages 6, 9, and 14)\n    And Maria works full-time as a medical assistant earning $42k/year\n    And Maria carries 100% of household care labor with no co-parent support\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Maria's personal_agent provides cognitive partnership support\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent serves as thinking partner for overwhelming decisions\n    Given Maria faces countless decisions daily with no co-parent to consult\n    And she manages children's needs, household economics, work schedule, and logistics alone\n    When Maria needs to make a complex decision\n    Then her personal_agent should function as cognitive co-parent\n    And it should help her think through decisions systematically\n    And it should surface important factors she might miss in exhaustion\n    And it should track patterns and provide analysis\n    And it should support her sovereignty without imposing its own agenda\n    And Maria should have the thinking partnership that coupled parents get from each other\n\n  Scenario: Protecting tiny spaces for Maria's personal identity and flourishing\n    Given Maria's life is consumed by parenting and work demands\n    And she has almost no time or energy for herself\n    When the personal_agent monitors Maria's well-being\n    Then it should identify and protect small moments for personal care\n    And it should remind Maria that she exists beyond her parenting role\n    And it should help her maintain individual identity despite overwhelming demands\n    And it should advocate for her personal needs, not just children's needs\n    And Maria should be supported in being a person, not just a parent\n\n  Scenario: Crisis detection when Maria approaches physical or emotional breakdown\n    Given Maria operates at unsustainable intensity with no backup\n    And she cannot afford to collapse because there's no one else\n    When the personal_agent monitors Maria's health and stress levels\n    Then it should detect warning signs of approaching breakdown\n    And it should alert Maria before crisis becomes emergency\n    And it should proactively surface support options\n    And it should connect her to emergency resources if needed\n    And it should treat Maria's well-being as critical infrastructure for family survival\n\n  Scenario: Validating Maria's superhuman efforts without toxic positivity\n    Given Maria performs extraordinary care labor daily\n    And society often dismisses or pities single parents\n    When the personal_agent provides feedback to Maria\n    Then it should genuinely recognize her superhuman work\n    And it should validate the weight of solo parenting\n    And it should avoid toxic positivity that dismisses her struggles\n    And it should acknowledge both her strength and her legitimate exhaustion\n    And Maria should feel truly seen, not patronized\n\n  Scenario: Supporting Maria's boundaries against impossible external demands\n    Given everyone wants more from Maria\u2014employers, schools, children, family, community\n    And she has finite capacity with no partner to share load\n    When external demands are placed on Maria\n    Then the personal_agent should monitor her total commitments\n    And it should help her evaluate what she can realistically handle\n    And it should support her in saying no when necessary\n    And it should remind her that she's already doing more than humanly sustainable\n    And Maria should have AI support for boundary-setting\n\n  Scenario: Cognitive load management when mental labor is overwhelming\n    Given Maria tracks countless details across three children's lives plus household plus work\n    And she has no partner to share the mental load\n    When Maria's cognitive load becomes unsustainable\n    Then the personal_agent should actively hold complexity for her\n    And it should remember what she can't\n    And it should surface important details at the right time\n    And it should reduce rather than increase mental labor\n    And Maria should have external cognitive support that makes solo parenting more manageable\n\n  Scenario: Decision fatigue support when every choice drains limited capacity\n    Given Maria makes hundreds of decisions daily with no co-parent\n    And decision fatigue is real and debilitating\n    When the personal_agent detects decision fatigue\n    Then it should simplify choices where possible\n    And it should provide clear recommendations based on her values and constraints\n    And it should reduce decision burden without removing her autonomy\n    And it should help her conserve decision-making capacity for critical choices\n    And Maria should experience reduced cognitive drain from constant choices\n\n  Scenario: Sleep deprivation monitoring and intervention\n    Given Maria wakes at 5am and collapses near midnight daily\n    And chronic sleep deprivation damages health and capacity\n    When the personal_agent tracks Maria's sleep patterns\n    Then it should monitor for dangerous sleep deprivation\n    And it should advocate for more rest when possible\n    And it should help her find efficiency that creates sleep time\n    And it should alert her when sleep deprivation threatens her health\n    And Maria should have support for this basic but often impossible need\n\n  Scenario: Financial anxiety management with realistic resource planning\n    Given Maria constantly calculates whether she can afford necessities\n    And financial stress pervades every decision\n    When Maria faces financial decisions\n    Then the personal_agent should provide clear financial analysis\n    And it should help her see trade-offs and options\n    And it should reduce anxiety through better planning and visibility\n    And it should help her make informed choices within severe constraints\n    And Maria should feel more financial agency despite limited resources\n\n  Scenario: Preventing isolation through connection to support networks\n    Given solo parenting is profoundly isolating\n    And Maria has no co-parent for adult connection and support\n    When the personal_agent monitors Maria's social connections\n    Then it should detect isolation and loneliness\n    And it should help her connect to other single parents\n    And it should facilitate community support without requiring more labor from her\n    And it should treat social connection as essential, not optional\n    And Maria should have pathways out of isolation despite time constraints\n\n  Scenario: Personal care token accumulation reflects superhuman solo work\n    Given Maria performs the work of two parents plus household management plus breadwinning\n    And her care contributions are extraordinary\n    When Maria's care tokens are calculated\n    Then they should reflect that she's doing multiple full-time jobs\n    And solo parenting should be valued higher than partnered parenting\n    And her care tokens should accumulate at accelerated rate\n    And the protocol should make undeniable her superhuman care labor\n    And Maria should see quantified recognition of work society often dismisses\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining hope and forward vision despite overwhelming present\n    Given Maria's daily reality is exhausting and relentless\n    And it's easy to lose hope when drowning in impossible demands\n    When the personal_agent provides long-term perspective\n    Then it should help Maria see beyond today's crisis\n    And it should remind her that children grow and demands will eventually shift\n    And it should celebrate progress and acknowledge her endurance\n    And it should maintain realistic hope without minimizing current struggles\n    And Maria should be supported in keeping vision of a sustainable future\n",
