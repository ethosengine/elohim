Family Layer Value Recognition for Young Child\n  As a young child in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want my care contributions to be visible to my family\n  So that I am recognized as a valued contributor to family flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the young_child user \"Tommy\" is registered in the system\n    And Tommy is part of a family unit with parent Sarah and sister Emma\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim is coordinating family care economy\n    And Tommy's personal_agent communicates with family_elohim\n\n  Scenario: Young child's care work made visible to family\n    Given Tommy has chosen strawberries for his sister Emma\n    And the care contribution has been recorded by personal_agent\n    When the family_elohim processes the contribution\n    Then Tommy's care work should be visible on the family dashboard\n    And parent Sarah should receive specific prompts\n    And the prompt should say \"Tommy chose strawberries for Emma\"\n    And the care contribution should be attributed to Tommy by name\n    And family care tokens should reflect his contribution\n    And the visibility should enable parental recognition\n\n  Scenario: Family boundaries shape young child's scanner permissions\n    Given Tommy's parents have set family values and boundaries\n    And the family has budget constraints of $40k/year household income\n    And Emma has a nut allergy\n    And the family prioritizes nutritional guidelines\n    When Tommy uses the Value Scanner\n    Then his personal_agent should enforce family boundaries invisibly\n    And budget-aware selections should be guided\n    And allergen items should be blocked without Tommy's awareness\n    And nutritionally appropriate options should be highlighted\n    And Tommy should experience boundaries as care, not control\n\n  Scenario: Sibling care relationships built through value recognition\n    Given Tommy regularly selects items for his sister Emma\n    And Emma is 7 years old\n    When Tommy makes care contributions targeting Emma\n    Then the family_elohim should track sibling care patterns\n    And positive feedback loops should be created\n    And Tommy's personal_agent should reference past successes: \"Emma loved the strawberries you picked last time\"\n    And Emma should be prompted to recognize Tommy's care\n    And sibling relationships should be based on mutual care, not competition\n    And the protocol should build family bonds through care visibility\n\n  Scenario: Family care token allocation includes young child contributions\n    Given the family participates in care token economy\n    And Tommy has made multiple care contributions\n    When family care tokens are calculated\n    Then Tommy's contributions should be valued appropriately\n    And his care work should not be dismissed as \"just helping\"\n    And tokens should accumulate to the family account\n    And Tommy should have age-appropriate awareness of his contributions\n    And the family should receive care token supplements for low income\n    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status\n\n  Scenario: Parental oversight protects young child while honoring agency\n    Given Tommy has genuine autonomy in the scanner\n    And he is only 5 years old\n    When Tommy makes selections\n    Then parental oversight should be supreme\n    And Sarah should have full visibility into Tommy's scanner usage\n    And Sarah should control what data is recorded\n    And Tommy's agency should be preserved within parental boundaries\n    And the balance should protect both safety and autonomy\n    And Sarah should not experience anxiety about granting Tommy freedom\n\n  Scenario: Family shopping as shared care experience\n    Given Tommy is shopping with parent Sarah\n    And multiple family members have different needs\n    When they use the Value Scanner together\n    Then Tommy should be learning from Sarah's modeling\n    And Sarah should be teaching Tommy value literacy through action\n    And the family_elohim should coordinate their different roles\n    And Tommy's contributions should be recognized alongside Sarah's\n    And shopping should be experienced as family care work, not consumption\n    And care economy principles should be transmitted through relationship\n\n  Scenario: Young child contributes to family decision making appropriately\n    Given the family is making decisions about meals\n    And Tommy has preferences and care intentions\n    When Tommy's input is solicited through the scanner\n    Then his preferences should be honored age-appropriately\n    And his care intentions (choosing for others) should carry weight\n    And the family_elohim should balance Tommy's input with family needs\n    And Tommy should experience having voice in family governance\n    And his participation should be genuine, not token\n    And family decisions should reflect that all members contribute\n\n  Scenario: Multigenerational family care patterns include young child\n    Given Tommy's grandparent is part of the extended family\n    And the grandparent provides childcare\n    When Tommy interacts with grandparent through care economy\n    Then his care contributions should be visible to grandparent\n    And grandparent's care for Tommy should be tracked\n    And the family_elohim should coordinate across generations\n    And Tommy should learn that care flows in multiple directions\n    And family care economy should span beyond nuclear household\n\n  Scenario: Family cultural values shape young child's value formation\n    Given Tommy's family has specific cultural values\n    And these values are configured in the family_elohim\n    When Tommy makes care decisions\n    Then the guidance should align with family cultural context\n    And his personal_agent should reinforce family values\n    And value literacy should be culturally appropriate\n    And the protocol should serve the family's chosen value framework\n    And diverse family cultures should be respected\n\n  Scenario: Young child's care patterns inform family resource allocation\n    Given Tommy has established care contribution patterns\n    And the family makes resource allocation decisions\n    When the family_elohim analyzes care economy data\n    Then Tommy's care patterns should inform family planning\n    And his demonstrated care for Emma should be considered\n    And resource decisions should reflect all family members' contributions\n    And Tommy should experience being valued in family economics\n    And his care work should give him legitimate standing in family decisions\n\n  Scenario: Family provides recognition that builds young child's care identity\n    Given Tommy has made care contributions over weeks\n    And the family_elohim has tracked patterns\n    When family recognition moments occur\n    Then Sarah should receive prompts for specific acknowledgment\n    And recognition should highlight Tommy's care work\n    And acknowledgment should feel genuine, not mechanical\n    And Tommy should internalize identity as caring family member\n    And positive reinforcement should build care-centered self-concept\n    And the family should collectively value invisible care labor\n",
