  "content": "Scenario: Schools challenge single-parent deficit narratives through care economy data\n    Given society often views single-parent families as inherently problematic\n    And this stigma affects how teachers and administrators view Maria's children\n    When schools engage with single-parent families\n    Then the educational_elohim should provide care economy data showing single parents' contributions\n    And schools should recognize single parents as providing extraordinary care\n    And deficit narratives about single-parent families should be challenged with evidence\n    And Maria and her children should be treated with respect, not pity\n    And educational systems should support single-parent family thriving, not assume deficiency\n",
