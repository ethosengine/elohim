  "content": "Scenario: Managing catastrophically tight household budget\n    Given I have temporary assistance, unreliable child support, and no employment yet\n    And I need to provide for two children on insufficient resources\n    When I plan household spending for the month\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me allocate resources across competing needs\n    And prioritizes nutrition, safety, and children's essential needs\n    And surfaces local resources and assistance I might be eligible for\n    And helps me track spending without shame or judgment\n    And identifies where I can optimize without sacrificing children's wellbeing\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to upcoming expenses before they become crises\n    And recognizes my resource management as sophisticated financial labor\n    And validates that I'm making the best possible choices under extreme constraint\n",
