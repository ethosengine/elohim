  "content": "Scenario: Municipal resource allocation reflects care economy priorities\n    Given Robert participates in municipal budget processes\n    And care economy principles should inform resource allocation\n    And municipal budgets often underfund care infrastructure\n    When municipal_elohim supports budget advocacy\n    Then it should help him understand municipal budget priorities\n    And surface opportunities to advocate for care infrastructure funding\n    And connect him to budget hearings and participatory budgeting\n    And help him articulate how care infrastructure serves community wellbeing\n    And support advocacy for elder care, childcare, and caregiver support funding\n    And build municipal budgets that prioritize care economy\n    And demonstrate that care should be public infrastructure priority\n",
