  "content": "Scenario: Studying national Constitutional Convention as deliberative democracy\n    Given National Constitutional Convention convenes with randomly-selected citizens\n    And this is largest deliberative democracy experiment in history\n    When I study the convention process and outcomes\n    Then I examine: how 10,000 citizens deliberate on existential questions\n    And I analyze: what enables productive vs polarizing disagreement\n    And I assess: quality of deliberation at unprecedented scale\n    And I explore: how amendments emerge from collective wisdom\n    And I track: influence of diverse perspectives vs expert domination\n    And I investigate: whether citizens can make wise choices under deep uncertainty\n    And My research tests: limits and possibilities of democratic capacity\n",
