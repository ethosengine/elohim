  "content": "Scenario: Elder care responsibilities coordinated between partners\n    Given Robert's parents ages 78 and 75 require increasing care\n    And Jennifer's father age 80 also needs support\n    And coordinating three aging parents is complex\n    When household_elohim coordinates elder care\n    Then it should track care needs across three parents\n    And help Robert and Jennifer distribute elder care responsibilities\n    And surface conflicts: \"Both mothers have medical appointments Tuesday 2pm\"\n    And coordinate with Robert's siblings and Jennifer's family\n    And prevent one partner from being overwhelmed by elder care\n    And recognize that elder care is shared household responsibility\n    And support them in managing care without destroying their partnership\n",
