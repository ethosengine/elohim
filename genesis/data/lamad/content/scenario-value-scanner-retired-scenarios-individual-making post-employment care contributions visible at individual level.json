  "content": "Scenario: Making post-employment care contributions visible at individual level\n    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity\n    And he provides occasional grandchild care\n    And he helps maintain his mother-in-law's home\n    And he serves on his neighborhood council\n    When Frank's care contributions are tracked\n    Then his personal_agent should quantify all volunteer and care labor\n    And it should calculate market value (~$20k/year construction volunteer work)\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for all contributions\n    And it should make visible that he's highly productive post-retirement\n    And Frank should experience himself as valuable contributor, not \"not working\"\n    And the data should counter cultural narrative of retired as obsolete\n    And his contributions should be recognized across multiple contexts\n",
