  "content": "# From ValueFlows to Elohim: Building the Care Economy\n\n## ValueFlows: The Vocabulary\n\nValueFlows is the vocabulary specification that hREA implements. It defines how to describe economic activity in a way that's:\n- **Network-native**: Designed for P2P systems\n- **Agent-centric**: Humans, not institutions, are primary\n- **Value-aware**: Tracks actual value, not just money\n\n## The Elohim Extension\n\nThe Elohim Protocol extends ValueFlows for care economies:\n\n| ValueFlows Concept | Elohim Extension |\n|-------------------|------------------|\n| Agent | + Care tokens, skill attestations, creator presence |\n| EconomicEvent | + Witnessed care work, invisible labor visibility |\n| Resource | + Time, attention, emotional labor as resources |\n| Appreciation | + Care token grants, community recognition |\n| Process | + Care processes, teaching, mentoring |\n\n## Constitutional Flow Control\n\nElohim adds governance layers that ValueFlows doesn't specify:\n\n```\nELOHIM VALUE FLOW CONSTITUTION\n\nLayer 1: Existential Minimums\n- Basic needs flow first\n- Care labor always recognized\n- Dignity threshold maintained\n\nLayer 2: Contribution Recognition\n- Value flows to creators\n- Absent creators accumulate in trust\n- Derivatives share with sources\n\nLayer 3: Community Circulation\n- Velocity requirements\n- Accumulation limits\n- Community pools\n\nLayer 4: Network Development\n- Infrastructure maintenance\n- Next community liberation\n- Coordination sustainability\n```\n\n## The Technical Bridge\n\n```\nhREA (Holochain)\n    ↓ implements\nValueFlows (Vocabulary)\n    ↓ extends\nElohim Protocol (Care Economy Rules)\n    ↓ serves\nHuman Flourishing (Purpose)\n```\n\n## Shared Concepts, Aligned Purpose\n\nBoth hREA and Elohim share:\n- **Visibility**: Making value flows transparent\n- **Agency**: Humans control their economic participation\n- **Coordination**: Enabling cooperation without central control\n- **Recognition**: Valuing contribution beyond monetary payment\n\nhREA provides the infrastructure.\nElohim provides the constitutional purpose.\nTogether: a care-based economy.",
