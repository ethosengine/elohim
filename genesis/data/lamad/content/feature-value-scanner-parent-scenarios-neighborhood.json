Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Parent\n  As a parent needing community support beyond nuclear family\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want connection to local parent networks and resource sharing\n  So that parenting is collective support, not isolated struggle\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the parent user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah lives in a specific neighborhood\n    And other parents in the neighborhood also use the Value Scanner\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy\n    And Sarah is learning that parenting doesn't have to be isolated\n\n  Scenario: Discovering compatible parents in neighborhood\n    Given Sarah needs connection to other parents\n    And compatible values and needs matter for effective support\n    When the neighborhood_elohim analyzes parent compatibility\n    Then it should identify parents with similar-aged children\n    And it should match based on compatible care values\n    And it should connect parents who could provide mutual support\n    And Sarah should be introduced to potential parent network\n    And the system should break down isolation\n    And neighborhood parent community should be facilitated\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating neighborhood childcare exchange\n    Given Sarah needs occasional childcare coverage\n    And she can provide childcare for others in exchange\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates childcare sharing\n    Then it should match parents for reciprocal childcare\n    And it should track care provided and received\n    And it should ensure exchanges are equitable over time\n    And childcare cooperation should be visible and valued\n    And parents should support each other sustainably\n    And neighborhood care economy should reduce childcare costs\n\n  Scenario: Bulk buying coordination with neighborhood families\n    Given multiple families buy similar groceries and supplies\n    And bulk purchasing reduces costs\n    When Sarah participates in neighborhood bulk buying\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate group purchases\n    And it should manage logistics of ordering and distribution\n    And it should track cost savings for participating families\n    And care tokens should reflect coordination labor\n    And neighborhood cooperation should create economic benefit\n    And the system should enable collective resource efficiency\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood resource library for children's items\n    Given children outgrow clothing, toys, and equipment rapidly\n    And buying everything new is expensive and wasteful\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates resource sharing\n    Then it should enable lending libraries for children's items\n    And it should track who has what available to share\n    And it should facilitate borrowing rather than buying\n    And resource sharing should be recognized as care contribution\n    And neighborhood sustainability should reduce family expenses\n    And the system should enable circular economy for child-rearing\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood parent skill and knowledge sharing\n    Given different parents have different expertise\n    And Sarah has teaching skills while others have different capabilities\n    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates knowledge exchange\n    Then it should connect parents for skill sharing\n    And Sarah could teach value literacy while learning car repair\n    And knowledge exchange should be tracked and valued\n    And diverse parent expertise should strengthen whole community\n    And neighborhood care economy should be knowledge-rich\n    And the system should enable parent-to-parent education\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood safety and child supervision cooperation\n    Given parents worry about children's neighborhood safety\n    And collective supervision is more effective than isolation\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates safety cooperation\n    Then it should enable coordinated supervision of playing children\n    And it should help parents watch out for all neighborhood kids\n    And collective care should be recognized and valued\n    And neighborhood should become safer through cooperation\n    And children should have freedom within community care\n    And the system should enable collective responsibility for children\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood emotional support and parent mental health\n    Given parenting is emotionally intense and often isolating\n    And Sarah needs connection to parents who understand\n    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates parent support\n    Then it should enable parent peer support groups\n    And it should provide spaces for parents to share struggles\n    And emotional support should be recognized as care labor\n    And receiving support should not be stigmatized\n    And parent mental health should be community priority\n    And the system should reduce parenting isolation\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care during family crisis\n    Given families sometimes face crisis (illness, job loss, emergency)\n    And neighbors can provide crucial support during crisis\n    When a neighborhood family faces crisis\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate mutual aid\n    And it should identify who has capacity to help\n    And it should organize meal trains, childcare, practical support\n    And crisis care should be specially recognized and valued\n    And neighborhood resilience should be built through mutual aid\n    And the system should enable rapid community response\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood advocacy for family-friendly infrastructure\n    Given neighborhoods need playgrounds, safe streets, family resources\n    And collective advocacy is more effective than individual effort\n    When the neighborhood_elohim supports collective action\n    Then it should coordinate parent advocacy for family needs\n    And it should enable organizing for better infrastructure\n    And advocacy labor should be recognized as care work\n    And Sarah's organizing should accumulate care tokens\n    And neighborhood improvement should be collective effort\n    And the system should amplify parent political power\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood cultural diversity in parenting approaches\n    Given the neighborhood includes families from diverse cultures\n    And different cultures have different parenting practices\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates across cultural differences\n    Then it should respect diverse parenting approaches\n    And it should facilitate cross-cultural learning\n    And it should prevent cultural imperialism in parenting norms\n    And diverse practices should be valued, not homogenized\n    And neighborhood care economy should be culturally inclusive\n    And the system should support multicultural community\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood connection across economic differences\n    Given the neighborhood includes families at different income levels\n    And economic inequality can divide communities\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates care economy\n    Then it should enable connection across economic differences\n    And care tokens should provide support to lower-income families\n    And resource sharing should reduce economic barriers\n    And neighborhood cooperation should reduce inequality impacts\n    And mixed-income community should be strengthened\n    And the system should build solidarity, not division\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood outdoor spaces and environmental care\n    Given children need access to nature and outdoor play\n    And Sarah wants to teach environmental stewardship\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates environmental care\n    Then it should organize neighborhood green space maintenance\n    And it should coordinate children's environmental education\n    And it should track ecological care labor\n    And Sarah's environmental teaching should be recognized\n    And neighborhood sustainability should be collective project\n    And the system should connect child-rearing to ecological health\n",
