  "content": "Scenario: Work schedule flexibility for academic obligations\n    Given Kenji must attend classes and cannot work during certain hours\n    And exam periods require reduced work availability\n    When Kenji's workplace_elohim advocates for schedule flexibility\n    Then it should help Kenji communicate academic constraints to employer\n    And it should support negotiating exam week time off\n    And it should recognize that flexible scheduling is care economy practice\n    And employers should accommodate student educational needs\n    And the system should help Kenji assert right to education\n    And work should support student development, not undermine it\n",
