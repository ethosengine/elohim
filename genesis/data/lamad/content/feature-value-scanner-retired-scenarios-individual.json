Individual Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person\n  As a retired person in post-employment life in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want my continued care contributions and dignity to be recognized\n  So that retirement is experienced as transition to care economy participation, not obsolescence\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the retired user \"Frank\" is registered in the system\n    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction\n    And Frank lives on fixed income of $28k/year for himself and spouse\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Frank's personal_agent is configured for dignity preservation\n    And the interface is optimized for aging-related accessibility needs\n\n  Scenario: Making post-employment care contributions visible at individual level\n    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity\n    And he provides occasional grandchild care\n    And he helps maintain his mother-in-law's home\n    And he serves on his neighborhood council\n    When Frank's care contributions are tracked\n    Then his personal_agent should quantify all volunteer and care labor\n    And it should calculate market value (~$20k/year construction volunteer work)\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for all contributions\n    And it should make visible that he's highly productive post-retirement\n    And Frank should experience himself as valuable contributor, not \"not working\"\n    And the data should counter cultural narrative of retired as obsolete\n    And his contributions should be recognized across multiple contexts\n\n  Scenario: Managing fixed income with dignity and sophisticated tools\n    Given Frank has $140/week grocery budget for two people\n    And his income is fixed at ~$28k/year and cannot be increased through employment\n    And he needs to maintain nutrition as dietary needs change with age\n    When Frank plans his household shopping\n    Then his personal_agent should provide sophisticated budgeting tools\n    And it should identify sales and optimize value per dollar\n    And it should track spending patterns across weeks and months\n    And it should suggest resource optimization without stigma or shame\n    And it should help maintain quality of life within real constraints\n    And the framing should be dignity-preserving, not scarcity-shaming\n    And Frank should experience agency and resourcefulness, not deprivation\n\n  Scenario: Channeling construction expertise to community benefit\n    Given Frank has decades of construction knowledge and skills\n    And he's now free from employer profit constraints\n    And his skills are valuable to community\n    When the personal_agent connects Frank to opportunities\n    Then it should identify community needs matching his construction expertise\n    And it should coordinate Habitat projects utilizing his specific skills\n    And it should suggest neighborhood repair opportunities\n    And it should facilitate mentoring younger workers\n    And it should help him teach construction workshops\n    And Frank should experience his knowledge as community asset\n    And retirement should feel like liberation to use skills for community good\n\n  Scenario: Building care economy capital for future aging needs\n    Given Frank is watching his mother-in-law navigate advanced aging\n    And he recognizes his own future care needs will increase\n    When Frank makes care contributions now\n    Then care tokens should accumulate to his individual account\n    And these tokens should represent future care economy resources\n    And the system should help him build reciprocal relationships\n    And he should be preparing for increased care needs in 10-20 years\n    And current contributions should create legitimate claims on future support\n    And Frank should experience agency in planning his own aging\n    And care reciprocity should flow across time\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent serves Frank's autonomy without infantilizing\n    Given Frank is a capable adult with 70 years of life experience\n    And he has decades of construction expertise\n    And the interface uses AI assistance\n    When the personal_agent interacts with Frank\n    Then it must preserve his full autonomy and dignity\n    And it must never be patronizing or infantilizing\n    And it must respect his expertise and judgment\n    And it must provide information and options, not directives\n    And it must acknowledge his skills and competence\n    And the relationship should be respectful partnership\n    And Frank should feel empowered and respected, never managed\n\n  Scenario: Accessible interface respects aging-related needs without patronizing\n    Given Frank is experiencing some age-related vision changes\n    And he may have reduced dexterity for small touch targets\n    When Frank uses the Value Scanner interface\n    Then the interface should display large, high-contrast fonts\n    And touch targets should be large and forgiving\n    And voice interface options should be available\n    And navigation should be simple and consistent\n    And no time-limited interactions should be required\n    And the design should be accessible without feeling condescending\n    And Frank should experience the interface as respectful and empowering\n    And cognitive load should be minimized\n\n  Scenario: Tracking nutritional needs as dietary requirements change with age\n    Given Frank's dietary needs are changing as he ages\n    And he needs more protein and fiber, less sodium\n    And he's managing early indicators of health conditions\n    When Frank shops for groceries on fixed budget\n    Then his personal_agent should track nutrition across time\n    And it should suggest foods appropriate for aging nutritional needs\n    And it should flag items high in sodium or added sugars\n    And it should highlight protein and fiber-rich options\n    And it should balance health needs with budget constraints\n    And nutritional guidance should feel supportive, not controlling\n    And Frank should maintain full agency over food choices\n\n  Scenario: Privacy control remains with Frank as autonomous adult\n    Given Frank's care contribution and health data is being tracked\n    And this information is sensitive and personal\n    When Frank determines data sharing preferences\n    Then he must have complete control over all his data\n    And he should choose what's shared with family, organizations, or community\n    And he can demonstrate care value to family if he wishes\n    And he can maintain complete privacy if he prefers\n    And health data sharing must be explicitly consented\n    And volunteer coordination can share relevant information\n    And Frank's autonomy over his information must be absolute\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining independence through effective resource management\n    Given Frank values his independence and self-sufficiency\n    And he wants to continue contributing without becoming \"a burden\"\n    When Frank uses the Value Scanner over time\n    Then it should help him maintain self-sufficiency and capability\n    And it should optimize his resources for maximum independence\n    And it should connect him to community resources without stigma\n    And it should make his care contributions visible and valued\n    And Frank should experience continued agency and autonomy\n    And the system should support him in aging on his own terms\n    And his continued productivity should be recognized and celebrated\n\n  Scenario: Recognition of care economy contributions builds continued purpose\n    Given Frank's contributions are substantial but unpaid\n    And traditional economics labels him as \"not working\"\n    And he's navigating the cultural narrative of retirement as obsolescence\n    When Frank reviews his care contribution data\n    Then he should see quantified value of his volunteer and care labor\n    And he should understand his economic contribution is significant (~$20k/year)\n    And he should experience himself as productive member of society\n    And the narrative of retirement as withdrawal should be countered\n    And Frank should have data to assert his continued value\n    And his dignity, purpose, and self-worth should be affirmed\n    And retirement should feel like transition to different contribution, not exit\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating multiple contexts of care contribution\n    Given Frank contributes across multiple contexts simultaneously\n    And he volunteers with Habitat, provides family care, serves on council\n    When his personal_agent tracks contributions across contexts\n    Then it should integrate volunteer work, family care, and civic participation\n    And it should coordinate scheduling across multiple commitments\n    And it should prevent overcommitment and burnout\n    And it should surface conflicts and help prioritize\n    And Frank should see his full contribution across all contexts\n    And multi-context participation should be supported and celebrated\n    And the system should help him balance diverse contributions effectively\n\n  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained throughout system\n    Given Frank participates in the Value Scanner\n    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers\n    When Frank chooses to disconnect from the system\n    Then his choice must be honored immediately and completely\n    And all data retention must follow minimal legal requirements\n    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed\n    And Frank's right to not participate must be absolute\n    And his autonomy over technology use must be respected\n    And disconnection should be simple, clear, and complete\n",
