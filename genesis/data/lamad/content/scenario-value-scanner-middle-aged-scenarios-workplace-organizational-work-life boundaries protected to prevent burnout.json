  "content": "Scenario: Work-life boundaries protected to prevent burnout\n    Given Robert manages intense professional and care demands\n    And work can expand to consume all available time\n    And sustainable performance requires work-life boundaries\n    When workplace_elohim monitors work-life balance\n    Then it should track whether Robert maintains healthy boundaries\n    And flag when work demands prevent care responsibilities\n    And recognize when he's working excessive hours despite care needs\n    And support him in setting professional boundaries\n    And advocate for organizational norms that respect whole life\n    And prevent burnout that would harm him, his family, and employer\n    And demonstrate that sustainable high performance requires balance\n",
