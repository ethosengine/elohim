  "content": "Scenario: Community challenges single-parent stigma through visibility\n    Given society often views single-parent families as deficient or problematic\n    And this stigma harms Maria and her children\n    When community care economy makes single parents' work visible\n    Then it should demonstrate that solo parents provide extraordinary care value\n    And it should challenge deficit narratives about single-parent families\n    And it should reframe single parents as care economy heroes deserving support\n    And community should actively combat stigma through recognition and respect\n    And Maria should experience community validation, not judgment\n",
