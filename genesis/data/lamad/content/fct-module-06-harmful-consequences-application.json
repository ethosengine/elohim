( We cannot continue sinning, \\[or advocate for consequences\\], so that grace may abound )\n\n\\* Our lives must reflect our identity as christians,   \n\\--if we-members are working in industry that is generating externalities, we could dedicate capacity to helping people re-align their vocation with those values, without penalty or disruption.   \n\\--if we-members are living in such a way that is generating externalities (Parable of the Polygons), we should encourage people to make active choices and not rely on passive hope that someone will happen upon what a life well lived looks like.\n**PracticeType:** application",
