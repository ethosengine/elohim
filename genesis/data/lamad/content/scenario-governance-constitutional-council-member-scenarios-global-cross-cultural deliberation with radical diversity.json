  "content": "Scenario: Cross-cultural deliberation with radical diversity\n    Given I am deliberating with citizens from radically different contexts\n    And we have different languages, cultures, values, lived experiences\n    When we work through constitutional questions together\n    Then we rely on: skilled translation and cultural mediation\n    And we practice: listening across profound difference\n    And we identify: shared human concerns despite diversity\n    And we navigate: disagreement with respect and curiosity\n    And we discover: unexpected common ground\n    And we honor: legitimate pluralism while seeking universal minimums\n    And we demonstrate: humanity can deliberate together on existential questions\n    And we embody: democratic hope for planetary governance\n",
