Individual Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities\n  As a person with disabilities living independently with support\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want my full autonomy, accessibility needs, and care contributions to be recognized\n  So that I can flourish with dignity as a complete person with agency and voice\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the person_with_disabilities user \"Alex\" is registered in the system\n    And Alex is 35 years old\n    And Alex has cerebral palsy affecting mobility and fine motor control\n    And Alex uses a wheelchair for mobility\n    And Alex works part-time remotely as a data analyst\n    And Alex's income is approximately $35k/year from employment and disability benefits\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Alex's personal_agent is configured for accessibility with voice interface\n    And Alex lives independently with support services\n\n  Scenario: Genuinely accessible interface enables full participation\n    Given Alex needs to use the Value Scanner\n    And Alex has limited fine motor control\n    When Alex opens the Value Scanner\n    Then the interface should support voice commands fully\n    And it should be compatible with Alex's screen reader\n    And keyboard navigation should work for all functions\n    And visual settings should be customizable for contrast and size\n    And the interface should be forgiving with error recovery\n    And accessibility should be built-in, not retrofitted\n    And Alex should experience the system as designed for them\n    And universal design principles should be evident throughout\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent serves Alex with dignity and respect\n    Given Alex's personal_agent is configured for their specific needs\n    And Alex has full autonomy over their life decisions\n    When the personal_agent provides support\n    Then it should respect Alex's expertise about their own needs\n    And it should never be patronizing or pitying in tone\n    And it should support Alex's decision-making without manipulation\n    And Alex should maintain complete authority over choices\n    And the agent should feel like a genuine partner\n    And Alex's disability should be accommodated, not pathologized\n    And every interaction should center dignity and autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Voice interface enables hands-free shopping list creation\n    Given Alex is planning their weekly groceries\n    And Alex has difficulty with fine motor tasks\n    When Alex wants to create a shopping list\n    Then Alex should be able to use voice commands exclusively\n    And the system should accurately recognize Alex's speech patterns\n    And Alex should be able to add, remove, and modify items by voice\n    And the interface should provide clear audio feedback\n    And Alex should not be forced to use touch or keyboard if they choose voice\n    And the experience should be as efficient as visual interface\n    And Alex should have equal access to all shopping features\n\n  Scenario: Recognition of substantial disability advocacy contributions\n    Given Alex performs significant disability advocacy work\n    And Alex mentors other disabled people in their community\n    And Alex does accessibility consulting for local organizations\n    And this sophisticated care labor benefits entire communities\n    When the Value Scanner tracks Alex's care contributions\n    Then advocacy work should accumulate care tokens appropriately\n    And peer mentoring should be recognized as skilled care labor\n    And accessibility consulting should be valued explicitly\n    And community organizing should count toward care economy standing\n    And Alex's substantial contributions should be made visible\n    And society should see Alex as contributor, not burden\n    And Alex's care work should shape their economic standing\n\n  Scenario: Personal data privacy under Alex's complete control\n    Given Alex's data includes sensitive disability and medical information\n    And this data reveals intimate details about Alex's body and needs\n    When data is collected about Alex's care patterns\n    Then Alex must have absolute control over all data sharing\n    And medical information should never be shared without explicit consent\n    And disability status should be shared only when Alex chooses\n    And support coordinators should access only what Alex permits\n    And employers should never see medical or disability data without authorization\n    And Alex's privacy must be protected with highest standards\n    And data governance should respect Alex's autonomy completely\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent prevents accessibility barriers proactively\n    Given Alex encounters accessibility barriers constantly\n    And the personal_agent monitors Alex's environment\n    When Alex plans activities or purchases\n    Then the agent should identify accessibility barriers in advance\n    And it should provide information about accommodations available\n    And it should suggest accessible alternatives when needed\n    And it should help Alex advocate for improved accessibility\n    And barrier documentation should support systems change advocacy\n    And Alex should experience fewer surprises and obstacles\n    And the protocol should reduce disability-related stress\n\n  Scenario: Coordination of support services with Alex maintaining authority\n    Given Alex requires assistance with some physical tasks\n    And Alex coordinates support workers for specific needs\n    When support services are scheduled\n    Then Alex should have complete authority over service direction\n    And the personal_agent should help coordinate schedules efficiently\n    And Alex should be able to communicate needs clearly\n    And support quality should be tracked per Alex's assessment\n    And Alex should experience professional partnership, not caretaking\n    And the relationship should be employer/coordinator to service provider\n    And Alex's autonomy should be structurally protected\n\n  Scenario: Personal flourishing recognized as legitimate goal\n    Given Alex has the right to pursue their own flourishing\n    And society often treats disabled lives as tragedies\n    When the personal_agent supports Alex's well-being\n    Then it should frame Alex's flourishing as inherent right\n    And it should support Alex's self-determined goals\n    And disability should not be assumed to diminish quality of life\n    And Alex's life should be treated as valuable as anyone's\n    And personal goals should be respected, not pitied\n    And the protocol should embody belief in Alex's full humanity\n    And Alex should experience affirmation of their worth\n\n  Scenario: Customizable interaction modes support diverse capabilities\n    Given Alex's capabilities vary day to day\n    And fatigue, pain, or other factors affect what's accessible\n    When Alex uses the Value Scanner on different days\n    Then Alex should be able to switch between interaction modes easily\n    And voice, touch, keyboard, and switch access should all be available\n    And the system should remember Alex's preferences per context\n    And Alex should not have to repeatedly explain needs\n    And flexible modes should accommodate fluctuating capabilities\n    And the interface should adapt to Alex, not force Alex to adapt\n\n  Scenario: Disability culture and identity respected and affirmed\n    Given Alex's disability is part of their identity\n    And disabled people have distinct culture and community\n    When the Value Scanner represents disability\n    Then it should use identity-first or person-first language per Alex's preference\n    And it should present disability as difference, not deficit\n    And it should connect Alex to disability community resources\n    And disability culture should be recognized as valuable\n    And Alex should see positive representation of disability\n    And the protocol should embody social model, not medical model\n    And Alex's disabled identity should be affirmed, not erased\n\n  Scenario: Personal agency maintained even when needing support\n    Given Alex requires assistance with some aspects of life\n    And society often conflates needing help with lacking agency\n    When Alex makes decisions about their life\n    Then needing support should not diminish Alex's autonomy\n    And the system should separate assistance from authority\n    And Alex should maintain full decision-making power\n    And support should flow to Alex's direction, not override it\n    And interdependence should be recognized as human reality\n    And Alex's agency should be protected even when vulnerable\n    And the protocol should embody disability rights principle: \"Nothing about us without us\"\n\n  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained with full accessibility\n    Given Alex has been using the Value Scanner\n    And constitutional constraints apply to all users equally\n    When Alex chooses to disconnect from the system\n    Then disconnection process must be fully accessible\n    And Alex should receive complete data export in accessible formats\n    And no manipulative retention patterns should be employed\n    And Alex's right to not participate must be absolute\n    And data portability should work with assistive technologies\n    And exit should be as accessible as entry\n    And Alex's autonomy includes the right to leave\n",
