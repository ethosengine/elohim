  "content": "Scenario: Politician distinguishes education reform evidence from ideology\n    Given competing reform proposals claim research support\n    And ideological advocacy masks as evidence-based policy\n    When the Observer evaluates education research rigorously\n    Then they see which reforms have strong evidence base\n    And identify advocacy research versus peer-reviewed findings\n    And understand limitations and contexts of research claims\n    And compare reform outcomes across diverse implementation sites\n    And make evidence-based policy decisions beyond ideological fights\n",
