  "content": "Scenario: Appeal reveals need for community-specific calibration\n    Given I appeal a privacy threshold that feels too low for my community\n    And multiple community members have filed similar appeals\n    When Community Constitutional Council reviews the pattern\n    Then they recognize this as community-wide concern not individual complaint\n    And They recommend community-specific calibration of privacy thresholds\n    And Community leader facilitates deliberation on local preferences\n    And Community residents participate in calibrating the protocol\n    And My appeal contributes to community self-governance\n    And Local sovereignty is exercised within constitutional bounds\n",
