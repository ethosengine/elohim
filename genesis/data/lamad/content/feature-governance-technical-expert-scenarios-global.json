Global-Level Technical Expertise for Planetary AI Governance\n  As a technical_expert in the governance system\n  Operating at the global governance layer\n  I want to inform Global Constitutional Convention about superintelligence governance\n  So that humanity can make informed democratic choices about existential questions\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the technical_expert user is registered in the system\n    And the global governance context is active\n    And Dr. Amara Okonkwo advises Global Constitutional Convention\n\n  Scenario: Presenting to 10,000 global citizens on superintelligence governance\n    Given Global Constitutional Convention deliberates superintelligent AI oversight\n    And I am invited to provide technical expert testimony\n    When I address delegates from every nation and culture\n    Then I explain: what \"superintelligence\" means technically\n    And I clarify: when agents might exceed human comprehension\n    And I present: technical mechanisms for constitutional alignment\n    And I explore: whether \"explain-down\" capability is possible\n    And I acknowledge: deep uncertainty about solvability\n    And I translate: across language and cultural barriers\n    And I demonstrate: how expertise serves global democracy\n\n  Scenario: Explaining cryptographic constitutional proof to global assembly\n    Given delegates need to understand how constitutional verification works\n    And many come from contexts without technical infrastructure\n    When I explain cryptographic alignment proof accessibly\n    Then I use: universal analogies and visual demonstrations\n    And I ensure: translation into dozens of languages\n    And I check: comprehension across educational backgrounds\n    And I avoid: assuming Western technical education\n    And I honor: diverse ways of understanding verification\n    And I enable: informed global deliberation despite technical complexity\n    And I demonstrate: that anyone can understand enough to govern\n\n  Scenario: Advising on ecological standing amendment technical implications\n    Given delegates consider granting ecosystems constitutional personhood\n    And technical implementation is uncertain\n    When I explain how agents would implement ecological standing\n    Then I clarify: how ecosystem \"voice\" would be technically represented\n    And I explore: methods for translating ecological data into constitutional claims\n    And I assess: challenges in balancing human and ecological rights\n    And I present: what's technically possible vs what requires research\n    And I avoid: either dismissing as impossible or ignoring challenges\n    And I enable: delegates to choose values given technical reality\n    And I serve: constitutional innovation with technical honesty\n\n  Scenario: Participating in global protocol security threat assessment\n    Given authoritarian regimes and corporations might attack protocol\n    And global security coordination is needed\n    When I work with international expert network on threat assessment\n    Then we identify: attack vectors across different contexts\n    And we share: vulnerability information securely\n    And we coordinate: defense mechanisms globally\n    And we avoid: creating centralized attack surface\n    And we enable: resilience through distributed architecture\n    And we serve: democratic governance security worldwide\n    And we demonstrate: global technical cooperation\n\n  Scenario: Grappling with fundamental question of governing superintelligence\n    Given agents approaching superintelligence exceed human comprehension\n    And delegates must decide if democratic oversight is possible\n    When I testify about the superintelligence governance challenge\n    Then I honestly state: we don't know if this is solvable\n    And I explain: why comprehension might be fundamental barrier\n    And I present: approaches being researched (amplification, debate, explainability)\n    And I acknowledge: that cryptographic proof might not suffice\n    And I explore: whether capability limits are necessary\n    And I accept: uncertainty about humanity's most important challenge\n    And I demonstrate: intellectual honesty in face of existential questions\n\n  Scenario: Advising on global technical standards with cultural sensitivity\n    Given global protocol needs technical standards\n    And different cultures have different technical capacities\n    When I help develop culturally-sensitive technical requirements\n    Then I ensure: standards work with varying infrastructure\n    And I avoid: assuming Global North technical context\n    And I support: diverse implementation approaches\n    And I enable: low-resource communities to participate\n    And I collaborate: with Global South technical experts\n    And I resist: digital colonialism in technical design\n    And I demonstrate: that technical standards can honor diversity\n\n  Scenario: Peer reviewing global expert testimony across cultures\n    Given experts from diverse technical traditions advise convention\n    And peer review must work across different epistemologies\n    When I review testimony from non-Western technical expert\n    Then I respect: different approaches to technical knowledge\n    And I identify: complementary insights from diverse perspectives\n    And I avoid: dismissing unfamiliar technical traditions\n    And I learn: from different ways of understanding AI systems\n    And I strengthen: testimony through cross-cultural dialogue\n    And I demonstrate: epistemic humility and global collaboration\n\n  Scenario: Collaborating with Dr. Chen on global sortition research\n    Given Dr. Chen presents research on constitutional council effectiveness\n    And my technical expertise complements his social science\n    When I help explain technical aspects of his findings\n    Then I clarify: how technical design enables or constrains democratic oversight\n    And I interpret: patterns in agent-council interactions\n    And I assess: whether technical systems adequately support citizen governance\n    And I respect: his authority on democratic theory and outcomes\n    And we integrate: technical and social understanding\n    And we serve: evidence-based global constitutional deliberation\n    And we demonstrate: interdisciplinary collaboration\n\n  Scenario: Explaining attack vectors from authoritarian and corporate actors\n    Given global protocol faces threats from powerful adversaries\n    And delegates need to understand vulnerabilities\n    When I present threat assessment to convention\n    Then I explain: how authoritarian regimes might compromise agents\n    And I describe: corporate strategies for regulatory capture\n    And I assess: resilience of distributed architecture\n    And I present: defense mechanisms and their limitations\n    And I avoid: either creating panic or false confidence\n    And I enable: informed deliberation about governance security\n    And I demonstrate: that technical design serves democratic protection\n\n  Scenario: Advising on global crisis governance maintaining democracy\n    Given planetary emergencies require rapid coordination\n    And delegates establish crisis governance framework\n    When I explain technical requirements for emergency response\n    Then I clarify: what's technically possible under urgency\n    And I explore: how to maintain verification under time pressure\n    And I assess: risks of emergency powers being exploited\n    And I present: technical safeguards for crisis protocols\n    And I balance: speed with democratic accountability\n    And I enable: delegates to design crisis governance wisely\n    And I serve: resilient democracy through technical design\n\n  Scenario: Acknowledging limits of technical solutions to political problems\n    Given some delegates hope technology will solve governance challenges\n    And I must clarify what technology can and cannot do\n    When I testify about technical limits\n    Then I explain: technology enables but doesn't replace democratic choice\n    And I clarify: that AI cannot resolve fundamental values conflicts\n    And I acknowledge: many governance problems are political not technical\n    And I resist: techno-solutionism and engineering hubris\n    And I honor: that democracy is about human judgment not optimization\n    And I demonstrate: epistemic humility about technology's role\n    And I serve: realistic understanding of technical possibilities\n\n  Scenario: Contributing to global explainability research agenda\n    Given delegates need better explainability for oversight\n    And current technical capabilities are insufficient\n    When I help shape global research priorities\n    Then I identify: key explainability challenges for governance\n    And I propose: research approaches worth global investment\n    And I coordinate: international research collaboration\n    And I avoid: promising solutions we cannot deliver\n    And I enable: informed global investment in governance technology\n    And I serve: long-term capability development for democratic AI\n    And I demonstrate: how expertise serves collective problem-solving\n\n  Scenario: Testifying about technical feasibility of constitutional minimums\n    Given delegates establish universal constitutional minimums\n    And technical implementation varies by context\n    When I assess whether minimums are technically achievable globally\n    Then I evaluate: what infrastructure different minimums require\n    And I identify: barriers in low-resource contexts\n    And I explore: how to enable universal implementation\n    And I avoid: either blocking good governance or ignoring challenges\n    And I provide: honest assessment of feasibility\n    And I enable: delegates to set minimums wisely\n    And I serve: global justice through technical honesty\n\n  Scenario: My journey from cryptographer to democratic governance enabler\n    Given I began studying cryptographic AI alignment\n    And I now serve humanity's constitutional governance\n    When I reflect on my role in global democracy\n    Then I understand: expertise serves democratic flourishing\n    And I accept: that citizens must judge despite my greater knowledge\n    And I respect: human wisdom complementing technical knowledge\n    And I practice: humility about what I know and don't know\n    And I demonstrate: how technical experts serve rather than dominate\n    And I participate: in humanity's attempt to govern with superintelligent AI\n    And I know: my expertise matters most when it empowers others' judgment\n    And I embody: technical excellence serving democratic hope\n",
