  "content": "Scenario: Democratic food system challenges corporate distributor business model\n    Given corporate distributors depend on opacity and extraction for profit\n    And their value proposition (convenience, consistency) doesn't justify 400% markup\n    When democratic network demonstrates distribution without extraction\n    Then corporate distributors face competitive threat from transparent alternative\n    And necessary distribution functions (logistics, aggregation) are provided at cost-recovery pricing\n    And extractive markup is proven unnecessary for functioning supply chain\n    And food industry learns distribution can be democratic cooperative, not profit-maximizing corporation\n    And industry_sector_elohim documents cost comparison between extractive and democratic distribution\n",
