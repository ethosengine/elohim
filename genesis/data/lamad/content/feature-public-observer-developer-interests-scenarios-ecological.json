Environmental Development Accountability for Developer Interests\n  As a developer in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the ecological governance layer\n  I want transparent environmental standards and honest sustainability\n  So that genuine environmental responsibility creates competitive advantage\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the developer_interests user is registered in the system\n    And the ecological governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates genuine sustainability commitment\n    Given a developer builds with high environmental standards\n    And wants sustainability track record to be visible and valued\n    When the Observer documents environmental performance\n    Then the developer shows: LEED Platinum certification on 8 of 10 projects\n    And stormwater management exceeds regulatory requirements by 40%\n    And green infrastructure investment totals $4M beyond minimum requirements\n    And environmental commitments were kept not just promised\n    And genuine sustainability creates market differentiation\n\n  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for greenwashing\n    Given a developer claims \"sustainable development\" in marketing materials\n    But environmental review shows minimal actual sustainability\n    When the Observer compares sustainability claims to actual practices\n    Then analysis reveals: LEED certification was \"certified\" not \"platinum\"\n    And green features are minimal required by code not additional commitment\n    And environmental impact study understated habitat destruction\n    And sustainability marketing exceeds actual environmental performance\n    And greenwashing faces uncomfortable transparency\n\n  Scenario: Developer environmental review gains honest analysis\n    Given a developer's environmental impact report claims minimal impacts\n    And used consultant known for developer-friendly assessments\n    When the Observer provides independent environmental analysis\n    Then comparison shows: wetland impacts understated by 60%\n    And habitat loss affects threatened species not mentioned\n    And stormwater runoff calculations omit downstream impacts\n    And independent assessment reveals actual environmental costs\n    And rubber-stamp reviews face evidence-based scrutiny\n\n  Scenario: Developer track record on environmental commitments\n    Given a developer promised tree preservation in previous projects\n    And claimed environmental mitigation would offset impacts\n    When the Observer tracks environmental commitment delivery\n    Then analysis shows: 67% of preserved trees died within two years\n    And mitigation site was not maintained as required\n    And environmental monitoring was incomplete and inadequate\n    And pattern shows promises made to gain approval not kept in practice\n    And accountability creates pressure for genuine environmental stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Responsible developer benefits from climate adaptation standards\n    Given a developer invests in climate-resilient building practices\n    And exceeds flood protection and heat mitigation requirements\n    When the Observer documents climate adaptation performance\n    Then the developer shows: flood resilience investment prevented $2M damages\n    And urban heat island mitigation reduced cooling costs 30%\n    And climate adaptation creates long-term property value\n    And responsible practices gain competitive advantage as climate risks increase\n    And genuine adaptation distinguishes from minimal compliance\n\n  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for environmental justice impacts\n    Given a developer's projects concentrate in communities of color\n    And environmental impacts burden already over-polluted neighborhoods\n    When the Observer analyzes environmental justice patterns\n    Then analysis shows: development increases pollution in Black neighborhoods\n    And environmental benefits (parks, trees) go to white affluent areas\n    And cumulative environmental burden violates environmental justice principles\n    And pattern reveals extraction from vulnerable communities\n    And environmental justice analysis demands equitable development\n\n  Scenario: Developer habitat destruction versus mitigation reality\n    Given a developer destroys 40 acres of forest for development\n    And promises habitat mitigation will offset ecological loss\n    When the Observer tracks mitigation outcomes over five years\n    Then analysis shows: mitigation site has 40% native species survival\n    And ecological function is fraction of destroyed habitat\n    And offset calculation was based on optimistic assumptions not reality\n    And net ecological loss is substantial despite mitigation promises\n    And honest accounting informs better environmental protection policy\n\n  Scenario: Developer water quality impacts gain watershed accountability\n    Given a developer's projects increase impervious surface and runoff\n    And environmental review addressed only immediate site impacts\n    When the Observer analyzes watershed-scale water quality impacts\n    Then analysis shows: cumulative development degraded stream quality\n    And downstream communities face flooding and pollution impacts\n    And watershed perspective reveals impacts ignored in site-level review\n    And developer contribution to cumulative harm becomes visible\n    And watershed accountability demands comprehensive impact assessment\n",
