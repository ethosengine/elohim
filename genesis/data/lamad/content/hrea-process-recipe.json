  "content": "# Processes and Recipes: How Value Gets Created\n\n## What is a Process?\n\nIn hREA, a Process is an activity that transforms resources:\n- Takes **inputs** (consumed, used, or cited resources)\n- Produces **outputs** (new or modified resources)\n- Involves **agents** who do the work\n\n```\nProcess: Community Health Checkup\n├── inputs:\n│   ├── consume: medical supplies\n│   ├── use: examination equipment\n│   └── work: nurse labor (2 hours)\n├── outputs:\n│   ├── produce: health assessment report\n│   └── produce: patient care notes\n└── involvedAgents: [nurse_adaeze, patient]\n```\n\n## Recipes: Reusable Process Templates\n\nA Recipe (via ProcessSpecification and RecipeFlow) defines **how** to do something:\n\n```\nRecipe: Emergency Stabilization Protocol\n├── inputs required:\n│   ├── IV supplies\n│   ├── Monitoring equipment\n│   └── Trained nurse (skill: emergency-triage)\n├── outputs expected:\n│   ├── Stabilized patient\n│   └── Care documentation\n└── estimatedDuration: 30-60 minutes\n```\n\nRecipes enable:\n- **Knowledge sharing**: Documented best practices\n- **Training**: New agents learn from recipes\n- **Coordination**: Teams know what to expect\n- **Quality**: Consistent processes\n\n## Processes in Care Networks\n\nCare work follows patterns:\n\n| Process Type | Inputs | Outputs |\n|--------------|--------|---------|\n| Patient Care | Time, supplies, skill | Health, comfort, documentation |\n| Device Repair | Parts, labor, expertise | Working device, knowledge |\n| Teaching | Time, knowledge, attention | Learning, questions, insights |\n| Meal Prep | Ingredients, labor, love | Food, nutrition, togetherness |\n\n## Chaining Processes\n\nProcesses connect:\n- `previousProcesses`: What came before\n- `nextProcesses`: What comes after\n\nThis creates **value chains** visible across the network:\n```\nFarm → Market → Kitchen → Family Meal → Compost → Farm\n```\n\nThe circular economy becomes traceable.",
