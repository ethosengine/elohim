  "content": "Scenario: Analyzing appeal patterns to understand constitutional interpretation\n    Given Riverside's Constitutional Council has reviewed 150 appeals over three years\n    And I have access to anonymized appeal data\n    When I analyze patterns in appeal types, outcomes, and reasoning\n    Then I identify: which decisions generate most appeals (adolescent autonomy)\n    And I examine: what predicts appeal success (constitutional strength, evidence quality)\n    And I track: how constitutional interpretation evolves through precedent\n    And I discover: whether marginalized communities have equal access to recourse\n    And I assess: if appeal process functions as democratic accountability mechanism\n    And My analysis reveals: how procedural justice works in practice\n    And Findings inform improvements to appeal accessibility and council training\n",
