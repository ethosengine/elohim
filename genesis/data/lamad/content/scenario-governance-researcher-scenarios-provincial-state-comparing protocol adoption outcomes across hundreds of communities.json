  "content": "Scenario: Comparing protocol adoption outcomes across hundreds of communities\n    Given I am studying all communities in the state that adopted Elohim Protocol\n    And I have comparison group of similar communities without adoption\n    When I analyze outcomes data from 200+ communities over 5 years\n    Then I examine: which communities adopted and which didn't (selection patterns)\n    And I measure: wellbeing, trust, economic resilience, social cohesion differences\n    And I use: difference-in-differences analysis to estimate causal effects\n    And I control: for demographics, economics, political culture confounds\n    And I identify: what predicts adoption success vs struggle\n    And I provide: statistical evidence about protocol effectiveness at scale\n    And I distinguish: average effects from heterogeneous effects across community types\n",
