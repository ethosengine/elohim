  "content": "Scenario: Developer water quality impacts gain watershed accountability\n    Given a developer's projects increase impervious surface and runoff\n    And environmental review addressed only immediate site impacts\n    When the Observer analyzes watershed-scale water quality impacts\n    Then analysis shows: cumulative development degraded stream quality\n    And downstream communities face flooding and pollution impacts\n    And watershed perspective reveals impacts ignored in site-level review\n    And developer contribution to cumulative harm becomes visible\n    And watershed accountability demands comprehensive impact assessment\n",
