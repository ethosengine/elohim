  "content": "Scenario: Quality standards improve through democratic supply chain accountability\n    Given corporate food system often degrades quality for profit maximization\n    And quality claims are marketing, not enforceable accountability\n    When democratic supply chain implements transparent quality documentation\n    Then farming practices are witnessed and documented (soil health, pest management, harvest quality)\n    And restaurant food preparation is transparent to customers\n    And quality accountability flows throughout chain\n    And standards continuously improve through democratic feedback and learning\n    And industry_sector_elohim manages quality documentation and accountability systems\n",
