Colossians 3:1-3, 12-13 ESV\n\\[1\\] If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. \\[2\\] Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. \\[3\\] For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.\n\\[12\\] Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, \\[13\\] bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.\n\n*ESV Translation*\n",
