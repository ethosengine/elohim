  "content": "Scenario: Explaining attack vectors from authoritarian and corporate actors\n    Given global protocol faces threats from powerful adversaries\n    And delegates need to understand vulnerabilities\n    When I present threat assessment to convention\n    Then I explain: how authoritarian regimes might compromise agents\n    And I describe: corporate strategies for regulatory capture\n    And I assess: resilience of distributed architecture\n    And I present: defense mechanisms and their limitations\n    And I avoid: either creating panic or false confidence\n    And I enable: informed deliberation about governance security\n    And I demonstrate: that technical design serves democratic protection\n",
