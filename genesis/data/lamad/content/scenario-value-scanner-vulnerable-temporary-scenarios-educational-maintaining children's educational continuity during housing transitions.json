  "content": "Scenario: Maintaining children's educational continuity during housing transitions\n    Given I am moving between temporary housing or shelters\n    And my children need stable educational engagement despite housing instability\n    When we experience housing transitions\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me understand children's educational rights (McKinney-Vento)\n    And coordinates school enrollment, transfers, and records\n    And ensures children can continue at current school if educationally beneficial\n    And arranges transportation if needed for school continuity\n    And tracks educational transitions and helps minimize disruption\n    And my personal_agent manages school documentation and deadlines\n    And recognizes educational coordination as substantial parenting labor\n    And validates that maintaining school stability protects children\n",
