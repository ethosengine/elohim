  "content": "Scenario: Identifying patterns in appeals informing local policy\n    Given Constitutional Council has reviewed many Riverside appeals\n    And I observe recurring themes and tensions\n    When I analyze patterns for community improvement\n    Then I see: many adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging\n    And I notice: recurring privacy threshold concerns\n    And I identify: business loan criteria creating frustration\n    And I bring: patterns to city council for policy response\n    And we consider: community-specific protocol calibration\n    And we propose: local ordinance updates if needed\n    And appeals inform: democratic policy making\n    And feedback loop: connects individual recourse to systemic improvement\n",
