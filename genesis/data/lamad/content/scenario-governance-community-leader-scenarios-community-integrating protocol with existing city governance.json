  "content": "Scenario: Integrating protocol with existing city governance\n    Given city council still passes ordinances and makes policy\n    And Elohim Protocol augments rather than replaces government\n    When I coordinate protocol with traditional civic structures\n    Then Community Elohim: provides information for council decisions\n    And city council: maintains authority over policy\n    And planning commission: still reviews developments (with agent input)\n    And existing institutions: work alongside protocol\n    And I clarify: boundaries and responsibilities\n    And we avoid: conflicts between agent decisions and local law\n    And integration strengthens: both democratic governance and AI support\n",
