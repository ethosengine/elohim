  "content": "Scenario: Comparative analysis of protocol adoption across 100+ nations\n    Given protocol has different adoption rates and outcomes globally\n    And I want to understand what predicts success across contexts\n    When I analyze adoption patterns and outcomes worldwide\n    Then I examine: economic factors (wealth, inequality, development stage)\n    And I assess: political factors (democracy, authoritarianism, stability)\n    And I explore: cultural factors (individualism, trust, religious tradition)\n    And I identify: historical factors (colonialism, technology access, institutional quality)\n    And I analyze: which factors are necessary, sufficient, or contingent\n    And My comparative research identifies: pathways to democratic AI governance\n    And Findings inform: international development and adoption strategies\n",
