Community Layer Care Economy Integration for Elderly\n  As an elderly person in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want my lifetime contributions to create legitimate claims on community support\n  So that assistance flows to me with dignity as reciprocity, not charity\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the elderly user \"Helen\" is registered in the system\n    And Helen has $24k/year fixed income (Social Security only)\n    And Helen has decades of community contributions\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates care economy networks\n\n  Scenario: Lifetime contributions create legitimate claims on community support\n    Given Helen has contributed to community for 60+ years of adult life\n    And she now requires substantial assistance\n    When Helen accesses community care resources\n    Then her care tokens should reflect decades of contribution\n    And community support should be framed as reciprocity\n    And she should not experience shame about needing help\n    And assistance should flow as legitimate return on lifetime of giving\n    And the community_elohim should make her contribution history visible\n    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy honors lifetime reciprocity\n    And Helen should experience dignity, not charity\n\n  Scenario: Community care coordination across multiple service providers\n    Given Helen receives support from multiple sources\n    And coordination prevents gaps and duplication\n    When the community_elohim tracks Helen's care network\n    Then it should coordinate home health aides, medical providers, and volunteers\n    And it should identify gaps before they become crises\n    And it should prevent duplication of services\n    And it should ensure Helen's preferences are communicated across providers\n    And care should happen around Helen, not to her\n    And the protocol should provide infrastructure for complex care coordination\n    And Helen should be center of coordinated care web\n\n  Scenario: Senior center programs maintain social connection and engagement\n    Given Helen participates in senior center activities\n    And social connection prevents isolation and decline\n    When Helen engages with senior center programs\n    Then the community_elohim should coordinate transportation\n    And accessibility should be ensured for all programs\n    And her participation should be recognized as community contribution\n    And programs should preserve dignity and agency\n    And senior centers should be spaces of continued growth, not warehousing\n    And the protocol should support elder engagement in community life\n    And Helen should experience valued participation, not make-work\n\n  Scenario: Food assistance programs accessed without stigma\n    Given Helen's $24k/year barely covers basic needs\n    And she needs food assistance to survive\n    When Helen accesses food programs through care economy\n    Then assistance should be presented as legitimate reciprocity\n    And no stigma should attach to receiving support\n    And her lifetime of contributions should frame current assistance\n    And food access should be coordinated through community_elohim\n    And dignity should be preserved throughout assistance\n    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy eliminates charity model\n    And Helen should receive support as right based on contributions, not as failure\n\n  Scenario: Medical care coordination ensures dignity in healthcare system\n    Given Helen navigates complex medical systems\n    And elderly patients often experience dehumanization\n    When Helen interacts with healthcare providers\n    Then her personal_agent should advocate for her preferences\n    And her advance directives should be communicated to all providers\n    And the community_elohim should coordinate across specialists\n    And her values should guide medical decisions\n    And she should be treated as person, not patient number\n    And the protocol should prevent the dehumanization common in elder care\n    And medical system should serve Helen's dignity and autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Community resource allocation prioritizes aging in place\n    Given community resources are limited\n    And policy choices affect elder care\n    When community governance makes allocation decisions\n    Then the community_elohim should surface elder needs\n    And aging in place should be prioritized over institutionalization\n    And Helen's voice should be included in community decisions\n    And resources should flow to enable dignity-preserving care\n    And the protocol should inform community policy\n    And care economy data should demonstrate what elders need to flourish\n    And community should invest in infrastructure that serves all ages\n\n  Scenario: Volunteer care networks prevent institutional warehousing\n    Given institutional care strips autonomy and dignity\n    And community care networks can enable aging in place\n    When volunteers provide support for Helen\n    Then the community_elohim should coordinate volunteer schedules\n    And volunteer care work should be recognized with care tokens\n    And Helen should remain in her home and community\n    And care should be provided with dignity and respect\n    And the protocol should demonstrate alternative to institutional model\n    And community care economy should prove that dignified elder care is possible at scale\n    And success should show that we can care for our elders without warehousing them\n\n  Scenario: Community memory projects value elderly wisdom\n    Given Helen holds decades of lived experience\n    And community memory has cultural value\n    When community memory projects are organized\n    Then Helen should be invited to participate as valued contributor\n    And her stories should be captured for community archive\n    And her participation should be recognized as contribution\n    And care tokens should reflect her memory-keeping work\n    And the community_elohim should facilitate intergenerational knowledge transfer\n    And the protocol should make visible that elders contribute to collective knowledge\n    And community should benefit from elder wisdom\n\n  Scenario: Healthcare costs managed through community care economy\n    Given Helen faces overwhelming healthcare expenses\n    And medical debt threatens her housing stability\n    When healthcare costs are tracked\n    Then the community_elohim should help navigate cost assistance\n    And community care economy should supplement inadequate insurance\n    And medical care should not require choosing between health and housing\n    And Helen's contributions should create claims on community health resources\n    And the protocol should address the healthcare affordability crisis for elderly\n    And community networks should provide economic buffer against medical costs\n    And care economy should demonstrate healthcare as community responsibility\n\n  Scenario: Elder abuse prevention through community monitoring\n    Given elderly people are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation\n    And community networks can identify concerning patterns\n    When the community_elohim detects potential abuse indicators\n    Then it should alert appropriate authorities\n    And Helen's safety should be prioritized\n    And intervention should preserve her autonomy where possible\n    And community should protect vulnerable members\n    And the protocol should provide infrastructure for elder protection\n    And abuse prevention should be community responsibility\n    And Helen should be safe in her community\n\n  Scenario: Advance care planning supported by community resources\n    Given Helen is planning for end of life\n    And advance care planning is complex\n    When Helen accesses community advance planning support\n    Then the community_elohim should connect her to counseling resources\n    And her advance directives should be documented in accessible format\n    And her wishes should be communicated across care networks\n    And community should support death with dignity\n    And the protocol should enable agency over end of life\n    And Helen's values should guide her death as they guided her life\n    And community care economy should extend through end of life\n\n  Scenario: Intergenerational care economy makes elder value visible\n    Given care economy spans all ages and capabilities\n    And Helen both receives and gives care\n    When community care tokens are tracked\n    Then Helen's lifetime contributions should be visible to community\n    And her current contributions should be recognized alongside care receipt\n    And younger generations should see care flowing across entire lifespan\n    And the protocol should demonstrate that humans have value at all ages\n    And community should learn that care reciprocity spans generations\n    And success should prove that care economy values elders as full participants\n    And Helen should experience community standing based on lifetime of contribution\n",
