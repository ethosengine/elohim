Bioregional Sustainable Economy Investment and Stewardship\n  As a community_investor in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the ecological_bioregional governance layer\n  I want to invest in bioregional ecological sustainability and resilience\n  So that capital supports regenerative economy aligned with ecological systems\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Patricia's investments operate within bioregional ecological context\n    And the ecological_bioregional governance context is active\n    And investment can support bioregional sustainability and climate resilience\n\n  Scenario: Investor capital enables regenerative agriculture transition at bioregional scale\n    Given industrial agriculture degrades ecosystems and requires fossil fuel dependence\n    And Patricia wants investment supporting ecological regeneration\n    When community investment supports democratic farm conversions bioregionally\n    Then capital enables farms transitioning to regenerative practices (Johnson Farm and others)\n    And bioregional agricultural system shifts toward soil building and carbon sequestration\n    And investment supports ecosystem regeneration while providing fair returns\n    And food system transformation includes ecological healing\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates regenerative agriculture investment across bioregion\n\n  Scenario: Investment returns include documented environmental benefits\n    Given traditional investment ignores or externalizes environmental impacts\n    And Patricia wants to know investment's ecological effects\n    When democratic businesses document environmental stewardship\n    Then impact reports include: carbon sequestered, water quality protected, biodiversity supported\n    And environmental benefits are measured using bioregional ecological indicators\n    And investment returns are financial plus ecological restoration\n    And capital allocation becomes ecological stewardship tool\n    And bioregional_elohim provides environmental impact measurement and reporting\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional investment coordination supports local sustainable supply chains\n    Given sustainable supply chains require coordination across bioregion\n    And Patricia's investment in Maria's Kitchen connects to Johnson Farm investment\n    When investment pool coordinates bioregional supply chain development\n    Then farm-to-restaurant supply chains are financed as integrated systems\n    And bioregional food miles decrease through local sourcing infrastructure\n    And investment supports entire sustainable supply chain, not isolated enterprises\n    And ecological benefits compound through bioregional coordination\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates supply chain investment across bioregion\n\n  Scenario: Community investment enables renewable energy cooperatives\n    Given fossil fuel dependence threatens climate stability\n    And Patricia wants investment supporting renewable energy transition\n    When community investment expands to renewable energy cooperatives\n    Then her capital supports community solar and wind projects\n    And democratic energy ownership replaces fossil fuel extraction\n    And bioregional energy sovereignty increases through distributed renewables\n    And climate mitigation is advanced through values-aligned investment\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates renewable energy cooperative investment\n\n  Scenario: Investor capital supports bioregional watershed protection\n    Given water quality depends on land use throughout watershed\n    And Patricia's investments affect and depend on watershed health\n    When democratic businesses prioritize watershed stewardship\n    Then farms implement water protection practices (buffer strips, reduced chemicals, wetland restoration)\n    And investment compensates watershed stewardship through sustainability premiums\n    And bioregional water quality improves through coordinated investment in sustainable practices\n    And community benefits from clean water enabled by investment priorities\n    And bioregional_elohim monitors watershed health and coordinates protection investment\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional climate resilience increases through democratic economy investment\n    Given climate disruption threatens communities and ecosystems\n    And Patricia wants investment supporting adaptation and resilience\n    When community investment prioritizes climate-resilient enterprises\n    Then democratic farms implement drought-resistant crops and water conservation\n    And local food systems reduce vulnerability to supply chain disruptions\n    And bioregional economic resilience strengthens through democratic coordination\n    And investment builds climate adaptation capacity\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates climate resilience investment and planning\n\n  Scenario: Investment in land trusts protects bioregional ecological integrity\n    Given land speculation threatens farmland, forests, and ecosystems\n    And Patricia values protecting bioregional ecological infrastructure\n    When community investment supports community land trusts\n    Then agricultural land is permanently protected from development\n    And forests and watersheds are stewarded for ecological health, not timber extraction\n    And bioregional ecological integrity is preserved through democratic land governance\n    And investment protects ecosystems while generating sustainable returns\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates land trust investment and stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Investor receives education on bioregional ecology and sustainable economics\n    Given most investors lack understanding of bioregional ecological systems\n    And Patricia wants to make ecologically-informed investment decisions\n    When investment network provides bioregional ecology education\n    Then she learns about watershed dynamics, soil health, biodiversity, climate impacts\n    And investment decisions are informed by ecological understanding\n    And investor community develops ecological literacy and stewardship values\n    And education strengthens commitment to sustainable investment\n    And bioregional_elohim provides ecological education and investment guidance\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional investment network coordinates across municipal boundaries\n    Given ecological systems transcend political boundaries\n    And Patricia's investments operate within watershed and foodshed, not just municipality\n    When community investment coordinates bioregionally across municipalities\n    Then capital flows to support bioregional food system (farms across multiple counties)\n    And watershed protection is coordinated across jurisdictions\n    And bioregional economic development transcends municipal fragmentation\n    And ecological coordination enables systemic sustainability\n    And bioregional_elohim facilitates cross-jurisdictional investment coordination\n\n  Scenario: Investment supports indigenous land back and traditional ecological knowledge\n    Given indigenous peoples have traditional ecological knowledge and land stewardship practices\n    And Patricia values supporting indigenous sovereignty and ecological wisdom\n    When community investment supports indigenous land back initiatives\n    Then capital helps indigenous communities reacquire traditional territories\n    And traditional ecological knowledge informs bioregional stewardship\n    And investment repairs colonial land theft while supporting ecological regeneration\n    And indigenous governance of land improves bioregional ecological health\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates respectful indigenous partnership and investment\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional investment reduces fossil fuel dependence across sectors\n    Given fossil fuel dependence threatens climate stability\n    And Patricia's investments can support energy transition\n    When democratic businesses across bioregion prioritize renewable energy\n    Then local food systems eliminate long-haul transportation fossil fuel use\n    And businesses invest in renewable energy through community investment support\n    And bioregional fossil fuel consumption decreases measurably\n    And investment accelerates just energy transition\n    And bioregional_elohim tracks energy transition and coordinates renewable investment\n\n  Scenario: Investor participates in bioregional ecological governance\n    Given bioregional ecosystems need coordinated stewardship beyond market forces\n    And Patricia wants ecological voice in investment governance\n    When bioregional democratic economy includes ecological representation\n    Then watershed councils, indigenous nations, and ecological scientists participate in investment governance\n    And investment decisions consider ecological health alongside economic returns\n    And bioregional governance protects ecosystems through democratic accountability\n    And ecological limits are respected in economic planning\n    And bioregional_elohim facilitates ecological governance participation\n\n  Scenario: Community investment measures success through bioregional flourishing indicators\n    Given traditional investment measures only financial returns\n    And Patricia wants holistic measurement of investment impacts\n    When bioregional investment develops comprehensive success metrics\n    Then returns are measured as: financial (5% annually), ecological (carbon sequestered, biodiversity supported)\n    And social indicators (living wages, democratic governance, community wellbeing)\n    And bioregional health (watershed quality, soil carbon, ecosystem resilience)\n    And investment success is holistic bioregional flourishing, not just profit\n    And bioregional_elohim provides comprehensive impact measurement framework\n",
