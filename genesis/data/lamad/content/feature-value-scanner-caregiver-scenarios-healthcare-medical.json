Healthcare Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver\n  As a caregiver navigating complex medical systems\n  Operating at the healthcare/medical governance layer\n  I want medical system navigation support and caregiver-as-partner recognition\n  So that care recipients receive appropriate care and caregivers are supported as essential care team members\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the caregiver user \"James\" is registered in the system\n    And James cares for David (52) with early-onset Alzheimer's\n    And David sees neurologist, primary care physician, and various specialists\n    And James coordinates all medical care and makes medical decisions\n    And the healthcare governance context is active\n    And the healthcare_elohim assists with medical system navigation\n    And James interfaces constantly with complex medical systems\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver recognized as essential member of care team\n    Given James attends all medical appointments with David\n    And James knows David's condition better than providers seeing him occasionally\n    When medical providers interact with James and David\n    Then the healthcare_elohim should ensure James is recognized as care team member\n    And providers should treat James as expert on David's daily reality\n    And James's observations should be valued in medical decisions\n    And caregiver knowledge should be integrated into medical care\n    And healthcare system should partner with caregivers, not exclude them\n\n  Scenario: Medication management supported across multiple providers\n    Given David takes multiple medications from different specialists\n    And medication interactions could be dangerous\n    When the healthcare_elohim tracks David's medications\n    Then it should maintain comprehensive medication list\n    And it should identify potential interactions across providers\n    And it should alert James to medication concerns\n    And medication timing and administration should be tracked\n    And medical complexity should be managed systematically\n\n  Scenario: Medical appointment coordination across multiple specialists\n    Given David requires regular appointments with multiple providers\n    And James must coordinate complex scheduling\n    When the healthcare_elohim manages appointments\n    Then it should maintain integrated calendar across providers\n    And it should remind James of upcoming appointments\n    And it should coordinate transportation and timing\n    And it should prepare James with information needed for each visit\n    And medical coordination burden should be reduced through system support\n\n  Scenario: Medical record integration for comprehensive care coordination\n    Given David's medical information is scattered across providers\n    And comprehensive view is essential for good care\n    When the healthcare_elohim accesses medical records\n    Then it should integrate information across healthcare systems\n    And James should have complete medical picture\n    And providers should receive comprehensive information\n    And medical record fragmentation should be addressed\n    And care coordination should be supported by integrated data\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver advocacy when medical system fails patient\n    Given medical systems sometimes fail patients with complex needs\n    And James must advocate for David's appropriate care\n    When the healthcare_elohim detects inadequate care\n    Then it should alert James to system failures\n    And it should provide information for advocacy\n    And it should help James escalate concerns effectively\n    And caregiver should be empowered to demand appropriate care\n    And healthcare system should be accountable to patient and caregiver\n\n  Scenario: Symptom tracking supports accurate reporting to providers\n    Given David's Alzheimer's symptoms fluctuate and progress\n    And accurate symptom reporting is essential for care\n    When the healthcare_elohim tracks symptoms\n    Then it should maintain detailed symptom logs\n    And it should identify patterns and changes over time\n    And it should prepare symptom summaries for appointments\n    And provider understanding should be improved by detailed tracking\n    And caregiver observation should enhance medical accuracy\n\n  Scenario: Insurance navigation support reduces administrative burden\n    Given medical insurance is byzantine and frustrating\n    And James must manage claims, authorizations, coverage\n    When the healthcare_elohim assists with insurance\n    Then it should help James navigate insurance processes\n    And it should track claims and identify problems\n    And it should assist with authorization requirements\n    And it should escalate coverage denials for appeal\n    And insurance complexity should not prevent needed care\n\n  Scenario: Respite care prescribed as medical necessity\n    Given caregiver burnout threatens James's ability to provide care\n    And respite is essential for sustainable caregiving\n    When the healthcare_elohim advocates for respite\n    Then respite care should be prescribed as medical necessity\n    And insurance should cover respite like other medical care\n    And providers should understand caregiver burnout is medical concern\n    And James's health should be recognized as essential care infrastructure\n    And healthcare system should support caregiver sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Advanced care planning supported early and comprehensively\n    Given David's condition is progressive and will worsen\n    And advance directives are essential before capability is lost\n    When the healthcare_elohim facilitates care planning\n    Then it should prompt advance directive discussions early\n    And it should help James and David document wishes\n    And it should ensure legal documents are comprehensive\n    And it should coordinate care planning across providers\n    And future care should be planned while David can still participate\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver health monitoring as part of care recipient's care plan\n    Given James's health directly affects his ability to care for David\n    And caregiver health collapse creates patient crisis\n    When the healthcare_elohim monitors caregiver health\n    Then James's health should be tracked as part of care plan\n    And providers should ask about caregiver well-being\n    And caregiver health problems should trigger intervention\n    And James should be required to attend his own medical appointments\n    And healthcare system should recognize caregiver health as patient health infrastructure\n\n  Scenario: Crisis intervention planning for medical emergencies\n    Given David's condition could deteriorate suddenly\n    And medical crises require rapid coordinated response\n    When the healthcare_elohim prepares for crisis\n    Then it should maintain emergency care plan\n    And it should ensure all providers have emergency contacts\n    And it should coordinate with emergency services\n    And it should prepare James for likely crisis scenarios\n    And medical emergencies should have planned responses\n\n  Scenario: Palliative care integration as disease progresses\n    Given Alzheimer's is progressive and eventually terminal\n    And palliative care improves quality of life before end stage\n    When the healthcare_elohim considers palliative care\n    Then it should introduce palliative care discussions early\n    And it should coordinate palliative services with disease management\n    And it should ensure David's comfort and dignity are prioritized\n    And James should have support for progressive care needs\n    And healthcare should include palliative approach throughout disease\n\n  Scenario: Medical provider education about caregiver as care partner\n    Given some providers dismiss or ignore family caregivers\n    And this undermines care quality and caregiver well-being\n    When the healthcare_elohim advocates for caregiver role\n    Then it should educate providers about caregiver expertise\n    And it should demonstrate caregivers improve care outcomes\n    And it should advocate for caregiver partnership in care teams\n    And providers should be trained to work with family caregivers\n    And healthcare culture should recognize caregivers as essential partners\n",
