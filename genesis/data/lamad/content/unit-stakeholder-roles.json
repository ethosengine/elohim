  "content": "# Stakeholder Roles: Who Participates in AI Governance\n\n## Beyond \"Users and Developers\"\n\nTraditional software has two main roles: people who build it and people who use it. AI governance requires a richer taxonomy.\n\nWhy? Because AI decisions affect people who never chose to interact with the system. The person denied a loan, the community subjected to predictive policing, the workers displaced by automation—they're stakeholders whether they signed up or not.\n\n## The Stakeholder Map\n\n### Appellants\n**Who**: Anyone adversely affected by an AI decision\n**Role**: Challenge specific decisions, surface problems\n**Powers**: \n- File appeals at appropriate level\n- Access explanation of decisions affecting them\n- Participate in hearings about their cases\n\n**For policy makers**: This role needs legal protection and accessible processes.\n\n### Community Leaders\n**Who**: Representatives of affected communities\n**Role**: Aggregate concerns, represent collective interests\n**Powers**:\n- Propose agenda items for council review\n- Participate in policy development\n- Communicate between communities and governance bodies\n\n**For influencers**: This might be you—translating between systems and the people they affect.\n\n### Constitutional Council Members\n**Who**: Appointed or elected oversight body members\n**Role**: Set policy, review systemic issues, adjudicate appeals\n**Powers**:\n- Vote on constraint changes\n- Commission investigations\n- Modify system parameters\n\n**For policy makers**: This is the governance role you understand—but applied to AI.\n\n### Policy Makers\n**Who**: Government officials, regulatory bodies\n**Role**: Set legal framework, enforce compliance\n**Powers**:\n- Define mandatory requirements\n- Investigate violations\n- Impose penalties\n\n**This is you**: The Elohim framework gives you levers that actually work at AI speed.\n\n### Researchers\n**Who**: Academic and independent researchers\n**Role**: Study system behavior, identify problems, propose solutions\n**Powers**:\n- Access data for research (with appropriate protections)\n- Publish findings\n- Advise councils\n\n**For developers**: This is the external validation that makes your systems trustworthy.\n\n### Technical Experts\n**Who**: Engineers, data scientists, AI researchers\n**Role**: Implement constraints, evaluate feasibility, translate\n**Powers**:\n- Assess technical implications of proposed policies\n- Implement approved changes\n- Flag infeasibility or unintended consequences\n\n**For developers**: This is your primary role—but accountable to the broader stakeholder system.\n\n## How Roles Interact\n\n```\nAppellants → surface problems → Community Leaders\n                                      ↓\n                              Council Members ← Researchers\n                                      ↓\n                              Policy Makers\n                                      ↓\n                              Technical Experts → implement → System\n                                      ↓\n                              [Feedback to Appellants]\n```\n\nNo single role has complete authority. Each constrains and enables the others.\n\n## The Elohim: Your AI Representative\n\nEvery individual in the Elohim system has an AI assistant—their personal Elohim. This assistant:\n- Explains decisions that affect you\n- Helps navigate governance processes\n- Advocates for your interests within constitutional bounds\n- Learns your values and context\n\n**For content creators**: Imagine an AI that actually works for you, not for advertisers.\n\n## Governance Layers\n\nStakeholder roles exist at every governance layer:\n\n| Layer | Example Appellants | Example Councils |\n|-------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Individual | Personal AI users | User-level constraints |\n| Family | Family members | Household governance |\n| Community | Neighborhood residents | Community councils |\n| Municipal | City residents | Municipal AI oversight |\n| Regional | State/province residents | Regional coordination |\n| National | Citizens | National AI policy |\n| Global | Everyone | Global commons governance |\n\n## Getting Involved\n\nYou don't need to wait for the full system:\n- **Policy makers**: Start requiring stakeholder input in AI procurement\n- **Developers**: Build feedback mechanisms into your systems\n- **Influencers**: Amplify affected community voices\n- **Everyone**: Pay attention to AI decisions in your life\n\nConstitutional AI governance starts with recognizing that you're a stakeholder.",
