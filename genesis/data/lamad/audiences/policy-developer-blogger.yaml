# Audience Archetype: Policy-Developer-Blogger
# Used by the pedagogical pipeline to tailor scope, sequence, and emphasis

archetype:
  name: "Policy-Developer-Blogger"
  description: >
    Tech-literate advocate interested in systems change. This archetype
    represents someone who wants to understand the Elohim Protocol well
    enough to advocate for it, contribute to it, or write about it.
    They are not experts in all domains but have broad curiosity and
    some technical foundation.

# What the learner already knows coming in
entry_knowledge:
  technical:
    - Basic understanding of distributed systems concepts
    - Familiarity with APIs and web development
    - Some exposure to blockchain/crypto discourse (not necessarily deep)
    - Comfortable reading code examples but may not write Rust/Holochain
  domain:
    - General awareness of governance and policy processes
    - Understanding of care economy concepts at surface level
    - Familiarity with social media platform dynamics
    - Basic economic literacy (not formal economics training)
  conceptual:
    - Systems thinking at introductory level
    - Exposure to ideas like coordination problems, collective action
    - Awareness of attention economy critiques (e.g., Social Dilemma)

# Why they're learning this
motivations:
  primary:
    - Understand enough to advocate effectively for this approach
    - Evaluate whether to adopt/recommend these ideas
    - Find concrete ways to contribute (code, content, community)
  secondary:
    - Write blog posts or articles explaining these concepts
    - Prepare presentations for stakeholders
    - Connect these ideas to their existing work/interests
  intrinsic:
    - Genuine concern about current tech/governance trajectories
    - Hope that better systems are possible
    - Desire to be part of meaningful change

# Decisions they'll be able to make after completing the path
decisions_enabled:
  organizational:
    - "Should my organization explore this approach?"
    - "What resources would implementation require?"
    - "Who should I connect with to learn more?"
  communication:
    - "How do I explain this to non-technical stakeholders?"
    - "What analogies and examples resonate best?"
    - "What objections should I anticipate?"
  contribution:
    - "Where can I contribute given my skills?"
    - "What domain should I focus on first?"
    - "How do I get involved in the community?"

# Time and attention constraints
time_budget:
  total: "6-8 hours for complete path"
  session_length: "30-60 minutes per session"
  frequency: "2-3 sessions per week typical"
  completion_horizon: "2-4 weeks"

# Points where they might resist or struggle
resistance_points:
  conceptual:
    - description: "Skepticism about 'love' as a technical principle"
      mitigation: "Ground in concrete mechanisms, not just philosophy"
    - description: "Concerns about feasibility at scale"
      mitigation: "Show real-world examples of similar patterns working"
    - description: "Questions about economic sustainability"
      mitigation: "Explain value flows with concrete scenarios"
  technical:
    - description: "Holochain unfamiliarity"
      mitigation: "Focus on what it enables, not implementation details"
    - description: "Constitutional AI abstraction"
      mitigation: "Use policy maker scenarios to ground concepts"
  emotional:
    - description: "Cynicism about tech utopian claims"
      mitigation: "Acknowledge limitations, show incremental path"
    - description: "Overwhelm at scope of change proposed"
      mitigation: "Break into digestible chunks with clear entry points"

# Learning style preferences for this archetype
learning_preferences:
  content_types:
    preferred:
      - Narrative explanations with concrete examples
      - Visual diagrams of system relationships
      - Real-world scenarios and case studies
      - Short video explanations (5-10 min)
    acceptable:
      - Technical documentation (for reference)
      - Code examples (when illustrating concepts)
    avoid:
      - Dense academic prose
      - Pure theory without application
      - Implementation details before concepts
  assessment_style:
    - Scenario-based questions over factual recall
    - "What would you do if..." over "What is the definition of..."
    - Self-assessment and reflection prompts
    - Application exercises over memorization

# How to sequence content for this archetype
sequencing_guidance:
  start_with:
    - Vision and motivation (why this matters)
    - One compelling domain to build understanding
    - Concrete examples before abstract principles
  build_toward:
    - Cross-domain integration
    - Technical depth for interested learners
    - Contribution pathways
  avoid_early:
    - Implementation details
    - Economic mechanisms without context
    - All domains at once (overwhelm)

# Success indicators for this archetype
success_indicators:

    - Can explain the five epic domains to a colleague
    - Understands the constitutional layers architecture
    - Knows the role of Elohim agents in the system
  skill:
    - Can identify which domain applies to a given scenario
    - Can articulate the value proposition to different stakeholders
