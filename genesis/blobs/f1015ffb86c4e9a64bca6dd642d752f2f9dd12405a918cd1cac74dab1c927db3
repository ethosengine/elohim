Scenario: Historical and comparative analysis contextualizing protocol
    Given I want to understand what's genuinely novel vs reinventing wheels
    And I study governance history and comparative political theory
    When I contextualize Elohim Protocol in historical perspective
    Then I compare: to Athenian democracy's sortition practices
    And I examine: medieval communes' participatory governance
    And I analyze: modern citizens' assemblies and deliberative innovations
    And I explore: attempts to govern non-human powerful systems (corporations, markets)
    And I identify: what ancient wisdom applies and what's unprecedented
    And I assess: whether humanity has governed comparable complexity before
    And My historical analysis reveals: patterns and lessons across millennia
