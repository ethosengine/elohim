Scenario: Moral and ethical development through care responsibility
    Given Marcus makes decisions affecting others' wellbeing
    And he balances competing needs with limited resources
    When Marcus exercises moral reasoning
    Then he should be developing sophisticated ethical thinking
    And he should understand fairness, reciprocity, and justice
    And moral development should accelerate through real responsibility
    And care ethics should be learned through practice
    And his moral maturation should advance beyond typical age expectations
    And care economy should support healthy moral development
