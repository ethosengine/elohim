Scenario: Workers build sector-wide safety standards exceeding legal minimums
    Given different entities have varying safety protocols
    And workers prioritize safety over corporate-style speedup
    When sector workers establish safety working group
    Then workers from multiple entities share safety best practices
    And workers collectively develop sector safety standards
    And standards exceed legal minimums in key areas
    And industry_sector_elohim monitors compliance across sector
    And sector reputation for safety becomes competitive advantage
