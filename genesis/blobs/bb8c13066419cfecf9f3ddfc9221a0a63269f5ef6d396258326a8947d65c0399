Scenario: Elder abuse prevention through community monitoring
    Given elderly people are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation
    And community networks can identify concerning patterns
    When the community_elohim detects potential abuse indicators
    Then it should alert appropriate authorities
    And Helen's safety should be prioritized
    And intervention should preserve her autonomy where possible
    And community should protect vulnerable members
    And the protocol should provide infrastructure for elder protection
    And abuse prevention should be community responsibility
    And Helen should be safe in her community
