Scenario: Journalist exposes environmental racism through pattern recognition
    Given pollution facilities cluster in certain communities
    And the journalist investigates environmental justice
    When the Observer analyzes environmental permit patterns
    Then the journalist sees industrial permits concentrate in communities of color
    And maps proximity of pollution sources to schools and residences
    And documents health outcome disparities by neighborhood demographics
    And shows pattern persists across decades of permitting decisions
    And publishes investigation exposing systematic environmental racism
