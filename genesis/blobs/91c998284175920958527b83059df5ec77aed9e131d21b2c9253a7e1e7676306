Scenario: Franchise operator role (if staying) transforms from controller to facilitator
    Given James controlled workers because franchise corporate controlled him
    And hierarchical enforcement was required by franchise agreement
    When James stays as transition steward facilitating democratic conversion
    Then his role shifts from implementing corporate mandates to supporting worker autonomy
    And operational expertise becomes consultation, not commands
    And workers request his input because it's valuable, not because he's boss
    And franchise termination liberates him to serve rather than control
    And workplace_elohim ensures steward role doesn't recreate hierarchy
