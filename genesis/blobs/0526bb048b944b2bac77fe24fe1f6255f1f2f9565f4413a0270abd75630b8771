Scenario: Multi-store price comparison supports budget optimization
    Given Marcus has limited budget and multiple store options
    And different stores have different prices for same items
    When Marcus plans his shopping across stores
    Then the personal_agent should provide multi-store price comparison
    And it should aggregate data from neighborhood stores
    And it should optimize shopping list across locations
    And it should help Marcus get best value from his $75 budget
    And neighborhood-scale data should reduce his individual burden
    And collective price intelligence should benefit all families
