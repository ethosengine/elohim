Scenario: Coordinating economic development across municipality
    Given Riverside needs economic revitalization
    And different neighborhoods have different economic needs
    When I coordinate city-wide economic development strategy
    Then Municipal Elohim: analyzes economic flows and opportunities
    And we identify: where business support like Maria's loan needed most
    And we coordinate: workforce development with neighborhood needs
    And we ensure: economic growth benefits whole city not just wealthy areas
    And we integrate: protocol support with traditional economic development
    And we maintain: accountability to residents for economic choices
    And coordination strengthens: inclusive economic resilience
