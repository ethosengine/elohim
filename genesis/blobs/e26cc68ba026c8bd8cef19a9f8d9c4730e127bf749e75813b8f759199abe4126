Scenario: Collaborating with Mayor Jamal on participatory action research
    Given I want research to serve community not just extract data
    And Mayor Jamal wants evidence to improve local governance
    When we co-design research questions and methods
    Then community priorities shape what we study
    And Local residents participate in data collection
    And We jointly interpret findings considering context I might miss
    And Research addresses actual needs not just academic curiosity
    And Riverside learns from comparative findings across communities
    And Results improve local implementation immediately
    And Research relationship respects community autonomy and knowledge
