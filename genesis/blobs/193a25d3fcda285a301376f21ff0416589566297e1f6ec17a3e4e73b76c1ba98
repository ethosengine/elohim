Scenario: Teaching grandchildren care economy values and principles
    Given Margaret is modeling care economy through her actions
    And Tommy and Emma are learning from her example
    When Margaret provides care and teaches family values
    Then the family_elohim should support intergenerational value transmission
    And children should learn that care creates value
    And they should see that elders have wisdom and worth
    And they should understand families are reciprocal care networks
    And Margaret's care teaching should be recognized as developmental work
    And next generation should internalize care economy principles
    And family culture should be transformed through children's learning
