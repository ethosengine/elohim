Scenario: Reciprocal care flows between Margaret and adult children
    Given Margaret provides childcare for her daughter's family
    And her daughter provides technology help and transportation
    When the family_elohim coordinates these reciprocal care exchanges
    Then all care flows should be tracked in both directions
    And Margaret gives care (grandchildren); daughter gives care (support)
    And reciprocity should be visible to prevent imbalance
    And both generations' contributions should be valued
    And the relationship should feel equitable, not one-sided
    And multigenerational care patterns should be sustainable
