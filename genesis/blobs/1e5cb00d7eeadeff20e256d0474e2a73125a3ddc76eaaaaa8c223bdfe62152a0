    Given Aisha has two roommates
    And the household needs equitable resource distribution
    When the household_elohim coordinates shared responsibilities
    Then it should track each person's contributions
    And it should help distribute household labor fairly
    And it should manage shared grocery purchases
    And it should coordinate cleaning and maintenance tasks
    And the system should make invisible household work visible
    And equity should be maintained through transparent tracking
