Scenario: Community investment enables conversion while building local ownership stake
    Given conversion requires $750K acquisition capital for three locations
    And community members want to support democratic ownership but lacked pathway
    When community investment pools fund significant portion of acquisition
    Then neighbors invest modest amounts ($2K-$20K each) in conversion
    And investors receive fair return (5% annually) plus social benefit
    And community gains financial stake in democratically-operated local institutions
    And investment connects neighbors to democratic economy building in their community
    And community_elohim manages community investment relationships transparently
