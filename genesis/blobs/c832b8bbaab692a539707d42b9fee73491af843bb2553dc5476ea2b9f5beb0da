Scenario: Care skills recognized as professional assets
    Given Robert has developed sophisticated coordination, resource management, and emotional intelligence through care work
    And these skills directly enhance his professional capability
    And traditional workplaces don't recognize care skills as professional qualifications
    When workplace_elohim analyzes Robert's professional capabilities
    Then it should make visible how care work develops professional skills
    And recognize that coordinating multigenerational care builds management capability
    And surface: "Your care coordination skills enhance your project management effectiveness"
    And help Robert articulate care skills in professional contexts
    And advocate that care experience should be valued in performance reviews
    And demonstrate that care responsibilities enhance rather than diminish professional capability
    And build workplace culture that recognizes care as skill development
