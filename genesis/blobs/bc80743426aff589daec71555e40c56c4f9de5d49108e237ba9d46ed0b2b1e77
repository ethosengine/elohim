Scenario: Parent opposes park closure affecting children's play space
    Given the municipality proposes closing neighborhood park
    And selling land to developer "to increase tax revenue"
    When the parent reviews Observer's park access analysis
    Then they see this eliminates closest play space for 400 children
    And understand remaining parks are across dangerous intersections
    And view data on child physical activity and green space access
    And connect with pediatricians concerned about children's health
    And parent advocacy preserves children's play infrastructure
