Scenario: Developer faces accountability for environmental justice impacts
    Given a developer's projects concentrate in communities of color
    And environmental impacts burden already over-polluted neighborhoods
    When the Observer analyzes environmental justice patterns
    Then analysis shows: development increases pollution in Black neighborhoods
    And environmental benefits (parks, trees) go to white affluent areas
    And cumulative environmental burden violates environmental justice principles
    And pattern reveals extraction from vulnerable communities
    And environmental justice analysis demands equitable development
