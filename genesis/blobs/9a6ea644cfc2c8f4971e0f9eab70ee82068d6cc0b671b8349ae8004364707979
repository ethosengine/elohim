Scenario: Community governance voice weighted by care contributions
    Given Robert has made substantial care contributions over decades
    And his care work demonstrates community investment
    When community_elohim supports governance participation
    Then his accumulated care contributions should give him standing
    And his voice in community decisions should reflect his investment
    And governance processes should actively solicit his input
    And his experience managing complexity should be valued in community planning
    And care tokens should connect to community governance participation
    And demonstrate that care economy participation creates civic voice
    And prevent governance dominated by those without care experience
