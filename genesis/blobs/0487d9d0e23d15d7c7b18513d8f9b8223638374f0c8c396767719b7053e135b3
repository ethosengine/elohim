Scenario: Household maintenance prevents costly emergencies
    Given Aisha is learning household maintenance
    And prevention is cheaper than emergency repairs

    Then it should provide preventive maintenance schedules
    And it should flag issues before they become emergencies
    And it should educate about maintenance tasks Aisha might not know
    And the system should protect her from expensive neglect
    And household competence should include preventive thinking
