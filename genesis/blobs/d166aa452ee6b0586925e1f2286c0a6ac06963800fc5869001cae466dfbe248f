Scenario: Organizer tracks accountability for paid sick leave implementation
    Given city passed paid sick leave ordinance
    And the organizer's worker-community coalition won the policy
    When the Observer tracks implementation and enforcement
    Then the organizer monitors employer compliance rates
    And sees enforcement actions and penalties for violations
    And identifies industries with systematic non-compliance
    And documents workers actually receiving sick leave
    And policy victory leads to implementation accountability ensuring real impact
