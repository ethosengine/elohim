Scenario: Age-appropriate boundaries feel like safety not surveillance
    Given Tommy's parents have configured family boundaries
    And allergen restrictions are active (Emma's nut allergy)
    And budget limits are set
    And nutritional guidelines are configured
    When Tommy attempts to select an item outside boundaries
    Then the system should gently redirect without explicit restriction
    And Tommy should experience boundaries as natural limits
    And the personal_agent should explain in care terms: "Let's find something Emma can safely eat"
    And Tommy should not feel surveilled or controlled
    And his autonomy should remain genuine within safe parameters
