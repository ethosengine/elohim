Scenario: Journalist tracks district promises on equity initiatives
    Given district announced equity plan with specific commitments
    And the journalist covered initial announcement 18 months ago
    When the Observer monitors equity plan implementation
    Then the journalist finds only 2 of 12 commitments implemented
    And sees budget that was supposed to fund initiatives redirected
    And identifies resistance from administrators in board meeting discussions
    And documents continued inequities despite equity rhetoric
    And publishes accountability story on broken equity promises
