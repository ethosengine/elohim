Scenario: Sleep deprivation monitoring and intervention
    Given Maria wakes at 5am and collapses near midnight daily
    And chronic sleep deprivation damages health and capacity
    When the personal_agent tracks Maria's sleep patterns
    Then it should monitor for dangerous sleep deprivation
    And it should advocate for more rest when possible
    And it should help her find efficiency that creates sleep time
    And it should alert her when sleep deprivation threatens her health
    And Maria should have support for this basic but often impossible need
