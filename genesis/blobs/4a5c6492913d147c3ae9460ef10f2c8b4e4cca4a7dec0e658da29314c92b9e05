    Given James's health directly affects his ability to care for David
    And caregiver health collapse creates patient crisis
    When the healthcare_elohim monitors caregiver health
    Then James's health should be tracked as part of care plan
    And providers should ask about caregiver well-being
    And caregiver health problems should trigger intervention
    And James should be required to attend his own medical appointments
    And healthcare system should recognize caregiver health as patient health infrastructure
