    Given Jordan's family celebrates holidays together
    And Jordan has their own traditions in the group home
    When Thanksgiving approaches
    Then Jordan decides where to spend the holiday
    And the interface helps Jordan weigh options (family vs. housemates)
    And Jordan's choice is honored by both family and household
    And if Jordan chooses family, they participate as an adult guest
    And Jordan's preferences about holiday activities are considered
    And Jordan experiences adult autonomy in family traditions
