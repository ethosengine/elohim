Scenario: Organizer tracks accountability for green space investment promise
    Given city committed to park improvements in underserved neighborhoods
    And the organizer's coalition won the commitment through campaign
    When the Observer tracks implementation progress
    Then the organizer monitors park renovation timeline and budget
    And receives alerts when spending lags or shifts to other areas
    And documents completion showing community organizing created change
    And has evidence to pressure officials if promises aren't kept
    And environmental justice organizing includes accountability for implementation
