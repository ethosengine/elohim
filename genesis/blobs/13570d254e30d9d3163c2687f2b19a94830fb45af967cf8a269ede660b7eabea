Scenario: Expressing food preferences with visual support
    Given Jordan has specific food likes and dislikes
    And the group home is planning weekly meals
    When Jordan uses the meal preference feature
    Then the interface shows pictures of food options
    And Jordan can indicate preferences using simple icons (thumbs up/down)
    And the system uses simple language ("Do you like chicken?")
    And Jordan's choices are communicated to household meal planning
    And Jordan experiences their preferences being honored
    And the personal_agent provides encouragement throughout
