Scenario: Teen participates in neighborhood safety and social cohesion
    Given Jasmine is present in the neighborhood frequently
    And neighborhood safety depends on collective awareness
    When Jasmine contributes to neighborhood social cohesion
    Then her participation in neighborhood events should be tracked
    And her relationships with neighbors across age groups should be valued
    And her presence and engagement should contribute to perceived safety
    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize social capital building as care work
    And Jasmine should understand that community safety is collective care labor
    And her generation should be seen as contributors to neighborhood wellbeing, not problems to manage
