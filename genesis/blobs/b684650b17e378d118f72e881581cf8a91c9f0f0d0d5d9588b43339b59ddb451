Scenario: Making visible that industry depends on worker care labor
    Given the food service industry depends entirely on workers' care labor
    And workers are serving essential human needs (nourishment and community)
    When the industry narrative treats workers as disposable
    Then the protocol should make visible workers' essential contributions
    And reframe food service as care work serving community flourishing
    And build consciousness that workers deserve dignity and fair compensation
    And transform industry culture from extraction to care economy alignment
