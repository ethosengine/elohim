Scenario: Community appeal informs local policy development
    Given my appeal revealed gaps in how Community Elohim handles certain situations
    And Constitutional Council made recommendations for improvement
    When Community Leader reviews appeal patterns and recommendations
    Then the leader brings findings to city council for policy response
    And Local ordinances may be updated to clarify boundaries
    And Community protocol calibration may be proposed
    And My individual appeal contributes to broader community governance
    And Democratic feedback loop connects appeals to policy improvement
    And Community becomes more responsive through listening to dissent
