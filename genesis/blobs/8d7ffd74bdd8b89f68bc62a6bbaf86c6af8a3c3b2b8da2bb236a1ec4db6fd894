Scenario: School board member understands transportation impact on families
    Given administration proposes transportation cuts for budget savings
    When the Observer analyzes transportation usage and impacts
    Then they see which families depend on bus routes for work schedules
    And identify students who will lose access without transportation
    And understand time burdens on working parents from route changes
    And calculate actual family costs of proposed savings
    And evaluate trade-offs with family wellbeing impact visible
