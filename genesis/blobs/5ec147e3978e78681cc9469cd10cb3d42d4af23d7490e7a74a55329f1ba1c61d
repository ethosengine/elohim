Scenario: Municipal recognition of informal care work in economic indicators
    Given Frank provides substantial unpaid care work
    And traditional municipal economic indicators ignore care economy
    When the municipal_elohim tracks economic activity
    Then it should include care work in municipal economic reporting
    And Frank's volunteer labor should be counted in economic indicators
    And municipal GDP should reflect care economy contributions
    And retirement should be understood as economic participation
    And policy should be based on complete economic picture
    And Frank's contributions should be visible in municipal economics
