Scenario: Supply chain transparency from farm to table builds trust and accountability
    Given corporate food system is opaque making accountability impossible
    And customers and workers don't know where food comes from or how people were treated
    When democratic supply chain implements radical transparency
    Then customers trace food from specific farm (Johnson Farm tomatoes) to their plate
    And farming practices (organic, regenerative) are documented and visible
    And farmworker wages and conditions are transparent
    And value distribution is clear showing fair compensation throughout chain
