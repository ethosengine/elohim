Scenario: Municipal level participates in county-state coordination
    Given Riverside is part of larger county and state systems
    And protocol must integrate with these layers
    When I coordinate upward with county and state governance
    Then I share: Riverside's experience with protocol adoption
    And I advocate: for policies supporting municipal sovereignty
    And I provide: evidence about outcomes for policy makers
    And I resist: regulatory overreach from higher layers
    And I seek: resources and support from county and state
    And I maintain: that community adopted protocol voluntarily
    And I protect: subsidiarity principle in multi-layer governance
