Scenario: Individual care token accumulation reflects care work value
    Given James provides care worth $50k+/year professionally
    And his work is invisible because he cares for his spouse
    When care tokens are calculated for James
    Then tokens should reflect professional-grade care value
    And his care work should accumulate significant tokens
    And tokens should give him standing in care economy
    And invisible spousal care should become economically visible
    And care economy should recognize family caregiving at professional value
