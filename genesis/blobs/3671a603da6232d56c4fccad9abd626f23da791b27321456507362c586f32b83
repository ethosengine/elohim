Scenario: Activist manages multiple digital identities safely
    Given the activist works on both local neighborhood issues and sensitive human rights cases
    When they create separate personas for different organizing contexts
    Then each persona has independent privacy settings
    And connections between personas are cryptographically isolated
    And the activist can switch contexts without cross-contamination
    And each persona's contributions earn reach independently
    And protection protocols apply to all personas
