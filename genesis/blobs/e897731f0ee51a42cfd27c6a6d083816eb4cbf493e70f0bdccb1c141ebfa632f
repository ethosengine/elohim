Scenario: Neighborhood advocacy for family-friendly infrastructure
    Given neighborhoods need playgrounds, safe streets, family resources
    And collective advocacy is more effective than individual effort
    When the neighborhood_elohim supports collective action
    Then it should coordinate parent advocacy for family needs
    And it should enable organizing for better infrastructure
    And advocacy labor should be recognized as care work
    And Sarah's organizing should accumulate care tokens
    And neighborhood improvement should be collective effort
    And the system should amplify parent political power
