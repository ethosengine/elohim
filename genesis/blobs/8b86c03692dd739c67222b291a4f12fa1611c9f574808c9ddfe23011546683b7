Scenario: Establishing federal-state coordination framework
    Given protocol operates at multiple layers
    And coordination is needed without centralization
    When I create federal-state cooperation legislation
    Then I establish: funding programs respecting state sovereignty
    And I create: interstate coordination mechanisms
    And I specify: federal role as support not control
    And I protect: community and state autonomy
    And I enable: national coherence with local diversity
    And I demonstrate: federalism working for AI governance
