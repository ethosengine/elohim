Scenario: Connecting with peer support from others experiencing similar vulnerability
    Given I need connection with people who understand domestic violence, housing crisis, or similar challenges
    And peer support reduces isolation and provides practical wisdom
    When I seek peer support through community network
    Then the community_elohim connects me to peer support groups
    And identifies others with shared experiences willing to connect
    And facilitates mutual support relationships
    And validates that peer support is different from professional services
    And protects privacy while enabling genuine connection
    And my personal_agent helps me participate in peer community
    And recognizes peer support relationships as care economy contribution
    And celebrates mutual understanding and solidarity
