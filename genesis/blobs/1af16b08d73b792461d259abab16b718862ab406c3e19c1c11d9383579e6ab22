Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities
  As a person with disabilities managing an independent household with support
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want to maintain full authority over my household while coordinating needed assistance
  So that I can live independently with dignity, managing my home as I choose

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the person_with_disabilities user "Alex" is registered in the system
    And Alex lives independently in their own household
    And Alex has cerebral palsy affecting mobility and fine motor control
    And Alex coordinates support workers for specific assistance needs
    And Alex's household operates on approximately $35k/year budget
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim coordinates Alex's household care economy
    And Alex maintains full decision-making authority over household

  Scenario: Alex maintains complete authority as household manager
    Given Alex coordinates support workers for physical assistance
    And some might assume support workers are in charge
    When household decisions need to be made
    Then Alex should have absolute authority over all household choices
    And support workers should provide services Alex directs
    And the household_elohim should structure Alex as employer/coordinator
    And Alex's autonomy should be protected systematically
    And the relationship should be professional partnership, not caretaking
    And Alex should never be treated as passive recipient of care
    And the protocol should embody Alex's household sovereignty

  Scenario: Accessible grocery shopping with delivery coordination
    Given Alex uses the Value Scanner for meal planning and shopping
    And Alex cannot easily transport heavy grocery items
    When Alex completes weekly shopping
    Then the system should coordinate delivery seamlessly
    And Alex should be able to schedule delivery to match their availability
    And heavy items should be handled by support workers or delivery staff
    And Alex should maintain control over product selection
    And delivery should be dignified, not framed as special accommodation
    And the process should be as efficient as able-bodied shopping
    And Alex should have equal access to all products and options

  Scenario: Meal planning adapted to Alex's preparation capabilities
    Given Alex has specific constraints around meal preparation
    And some physical tasks are difficult or impossible without assistance
    When Alex plans weekly meals
    Then the household_elohim should suggest meals within Alex's capabilities
    And it should account for what Alex can prepare independently
    And it should coordinate support worker assistance for complex prep
    And nutritional needs should be met within preparation constraints
    And meal planning should feel empowering, not limiting
    And Alex should maintain choice over their food and nutrition
    And adaptations should expand options, not restrict them

  Scenario: Household budget management on combined disability benefits and part-time income
    Given Alex's household operates on $35k/year
    And income comes from part-time employment and disability benefits
    When Alex manages household budget
    Then the household_elohim should track spending against limited resources
    And it should help Alex prioritize essential expenses
    And disability-related costs (equipment, support services, medical) should be factored in
    And Alex should be able to make informed financial decisions
    And budget tools should respect Alex's competence in managing money
    And the system should support Alex's financial autonomy
    And resource constraints should be managed with dignity

  Scenario: Support worker scheduling coordinated efficiently
    Given Alex requires assistance with specific physical tasks
    And support workers have their own schedules
    When Alex needs to coordinate support services
    Then the household_elohim should help schedule support worker visits efficiently
    And it should match Alex's needs with worker availability
    And Alex should be able to communicate requirements clearly
    And schedule changes should be accommodated flexibly
    And coordination should reduce Alex's cognitive load
    And Alex should maintain authority over when and how support is provided
    And the system should serve Alex's independence, not create dependence

  Scenario: Household maintenance coordinated with accessibility considerations
    Given Alex's household requires regular maintenance
    And some maintenance tasks are physically inaccessible to Alex
    When household maintenance needs arise
    Then the household_elohim should help Alex coordinate necessary services
    And it should identify which tasks need external assistance
    And it should help Alex hire appropriate service providers
    And Alex should maintain authority over what work is done and how
    And service providers should respect Alex's expertise about their own home
    And coordination should be efficient and dignity-preserving
    And Alex should be able to maintain their home independently with appropriate support

  Scenario: Household care token accumulation includes Alex's contributions
    Given Alex participates in care token economy
    And Alex contributes to household through management and coordination
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then Alex's household management labor should be valued appropriately
    And Alex's cognitive work of coordinating support should count
    And care tokens should accumulate from Alex's contributions
    And Alex should receive care token supplements based on household income level
    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status
    And Alex should be positioned as contributor, not just recipient
    And economic standing should reflect Alex's actual care work

  Scenario: Household technology adapted for Alex's accessibility needs
    Given Alex's household includes various technologies
    And accessibility is essential for Alex's independence
    When Alex manages household systems
    Then all household technology should be accessible to Alex
    And the household_elohim should integrate with accessible smart home systems
    And Alex should be able to control environment through voice or other accessible means
    And technology should reduce barriers, not create them
    And universal design principles should guide all technology choices
    And Alex should have equal or better access than non-disabled people
    And technology should serve Alex's independence

  Scenario: Emergency preparedness accounts for Alex's specific needs
    Given Alex has disability-related emergency considerations
    And emergencies require rapid response
    When the household_elohim plans for emergency scenarios
    Then emergency plans should account for Alex's mobility limitations
    And evacuation plans should be accessible to Alex
    And medical equipment needs should be factored into emergency supplies
    And support worker backup plans should be established
    And Alex should have accessible emergency communication methods
    And emergency preparedness should reduce Alex's vulnerability
    And planning should be proactive, not reactive

  Scenario: Household privacy protected from service providers
    Given support workers and service providers enter Alex's household
    And this creates potential privacy vulnerabilities
    When household data is collected
    Then Alex should control what household information is shared with service providers
    And support workers should access only information necessary for their tasks
    And Alex's medical and personal information should remain private
    And household patterns should not be shared without Alex's consent
    And the household_elohim should protect Alex's privacy systematically
    And Alex should feel secure in their own home
    And privacy protections should be robust even with frequent visitors

  Scenario: Household care economy visible to counter narrative of burden
    Given society often frames disabled people as burdens on households
    And Alex contributes substantial household labor
    When household care contributions are displayed
    Then Alex's management, coordination, and decision-making should be visible
    And the household_elohim should quantify Alex's cognitive and emotional labor
    And data should counter the narrative that Alex is dependent burden
    And Alex should see themselves as household contributor
    And visibility should shift cultural understanding of disability and contribution
    And the protocol should make Alex's care work undeniable
    And Alex should experience affirmation of their household value

  Scenario: Accessible household coordination reduces disability-related stress
    Given navigating household management with disability is inherently stressful
    And inaccessible systems compound that stress
    When the household_elohim coordinates household functions
    Then it should actively reduce Alex's cognitive load
    And it should prevent accessibility barriers from becoming crises
    And it should provide gentle reminders and support
    And coordination should feel like genuine assistance
    And Alex should experience less stress, not more
    And the protocol should recognize that accessibility reduces disability
    And good design should make Alex's household management easier than current systems
