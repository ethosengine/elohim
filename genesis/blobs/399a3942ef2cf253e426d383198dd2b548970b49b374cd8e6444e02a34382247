Scenario: Board member evaluates superintendent budget proposal with impact analysis
    Given administration proposes budget with cuts and reallocations
    And presents optimistic framing of difficult trade-offs
    When the Observer provides impact analysis
    Then they see which students and schools bear burden of cuts
    And understand transportation changes affect working parent schedules
    And identify which programs lose funding versus protected priorities
    And compare budget choices to similar districts
    And ask informed questions challenging rosy assumptions
