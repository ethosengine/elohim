Scenario: Financial autonomy maintained while supporting multiple generations
    Given Robert provides financial support to children
    And he contributes to parents' long-term care costs
    And he maintains his household
    And he saves for his own retirement
    When his personal_agent analyzes his financial situation
    Then it should help him balance competing financial demands
    And protect his own financial security
    And surface when generational support threatens his retirement
    And provide analysis: "Continuing current support level will delay retirement by 3 years"
    And help him make informed tradeoffs
    And ensure he doesn't sacrifice his own future for present generational needs
    And support sustainable multigenerational financial planning
