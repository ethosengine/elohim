Scenario: Citizen evaluates development environmental claims
    Given a developer claims their project is environmentally sustainable
    And uses terms like "green building" and "eco-friendly"
    When the Observer fact-checks environmental claims
    Then the citizen sees actual environmental review data
    And views the developer's environmental track record
    And understands real impacts on habitat, pollution, resources
    And can distinguish genuine sustainability from greenwashing
    And environmental accountability becomes measurable
