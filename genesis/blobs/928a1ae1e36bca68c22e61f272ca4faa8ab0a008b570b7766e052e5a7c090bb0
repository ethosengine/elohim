Scenario: Appellant case reveals gap in global constitutional framework
    Given Marcus's mental health intervention appeal
    And similar appeals occur worldwide across cultures
    And constitutional interpretations vary dramatically between regions
    When the pattern is analyzed for global constitutional significance
    Then researchers identify fundamental unresolved question
    And the question is whether privacy is universal right or culturally specific
    And appellants from diverse cultures share their experiences
    And the question is elevated for Constitutional Convention consideration
    And Marcus's case contributes to global constitutional deliberation
