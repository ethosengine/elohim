Scenario: Food service training and certification evolves to include democratic governance
    Given industry training focuses on franchise compliance and hierarchical management
    And democratic operations require different skills (facilitation, collaboration, transparency)
    When democratic food service network reaches scale
    Then industry training programs add democratic governance and worker ownership modules
    And certification standards recognize cooperative business competencies
    And culinary schools and hospitality programs teach democratic operation
    And sector workforce development supports democratic model proliferation
    And industry_sector_elohim develops democratic food service training curriculum
