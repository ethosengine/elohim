Scenario: Coordinating household participation across multiple contexts
    Given Frank volunteers with Habitat and serves on council
    And his wife has her own community participation
    And both provide family care across generations
    When the household_elohim coordinates participation
    Then it should integrate both partners' schedules and commitments
    And it should prevent household overcommitment
    And it should ensure both partners have rest and personal time
    And it should support diverse participation that serves flourishing
    And coordination should enable rather than constrain engagement
    And household should function as base for community contribution
