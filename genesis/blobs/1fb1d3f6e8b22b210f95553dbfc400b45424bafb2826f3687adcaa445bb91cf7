Scenario: Activist tracks polluter violations and regulatory failure
    Given a facility near the activist's community violates air quality standards
    And regulatory response seems inadequate
    When the Observer documents violation history
    Then the activist sees 47 violations over three years
    And learns penalties were minimal and ineffective
    And identifies which regulators approved permits despite violations
    And exposes revolving door between industry and enforcement
    And regulatory capture becomes visible and challengeable
