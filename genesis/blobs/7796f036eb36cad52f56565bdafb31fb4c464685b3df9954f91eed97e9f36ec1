Scenario: Managing household privacy and safety boundaries
    Given I have safety concerns about my abuser finding me
    And household information could compromise our safety
    When I manage household information sharing
    Then the Value Scanner helps me control what information exists about household location
    And supports necessary anonymity with service providers
    And helps me teach children appropriate privacy practices
    And tracks who has what information about our household
    And alerts me to potential privacy/safety breaches
    And my personal_agent reminds me of safety protocols
    And recognizes that managing safety is constant cognitive and emotional labor
    And validates that my vigilance is appropriate and necessary
