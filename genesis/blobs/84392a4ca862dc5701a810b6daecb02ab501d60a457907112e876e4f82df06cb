Scenario: Teacher understanding of single-parent household stress on children
    Given children in single-parent families may experience unique stressors
    And teachers should understand these realities without stigmatizing
    When teachers work with Maria's children
    Then the educational_elohim should help educators understand single-parent contexts
    And teachers should recognize potential impacts on children without deficit framing
    And children should receive appropriate support without being labeled as "at-risk" due to family structure
    And schools should support thriving despite different family structures
    And Maria's children should be seen as individuals, not stereotyped by single-parent status
