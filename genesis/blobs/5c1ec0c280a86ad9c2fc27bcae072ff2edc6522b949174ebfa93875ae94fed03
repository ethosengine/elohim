Scenario: Watershed protection becomes shared bioregional responsibility
    Given agricultural runoff affects water quality throughout watershed
    And individual farms lack resources or incentives to protect water comprehensively
    When bioregional democratic network coordinates watershed stewardship
    Then farms across watershed implement water protection practices (buffer strips, reduced chemicals)
    And water quality monitoring shows improvement from coordinated stewardship
    And downstream communities benefit from agricultural water protection
    And watershed health becomes collective responsibility with visible benefits
    And bioregional_elohim monitors watershed health and coordinates protection efforts
