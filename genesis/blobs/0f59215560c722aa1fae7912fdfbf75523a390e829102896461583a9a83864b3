Scenario: Teen participates in bioregional ecological restoration
    Given Jasmine volunteers for watershed cleanup events
    And she plants native species in community restoration projects
    When bioregional_elohim tracks her ecological care labor
    Then it should recognize restoration work as care for land and ecosystem
    And value her labor for ecosystem health at care economy rates
    And calculate ecological benefits from restoration participation
    And acknowledge that she's doing work professional ecologists would be paid for
    And demonstrate that ecological labor deserves recognition and compensation
    And support her understanding that ecosystem repair is collective responsibility
