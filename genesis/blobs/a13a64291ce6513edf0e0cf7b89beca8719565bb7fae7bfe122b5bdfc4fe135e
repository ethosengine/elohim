**Instructions:** Reflect on your daily technology use and answer the following:

Identify three specific ways you currently use technology that may not fully align with Jesus' command to love God and neighbor.  
How could you practically modify or replace these practices to better embody this commandment?  
Brainstorm a new technology, system, or lifestyle change that would help you better love God and neighbor. Be as specific and practical as possible in your proposal."

This three-part question now:

Encourages critical self-examination of current habits  
Prompts practical thinking about immediate changes  
Fosters creativity in imagining new, love-centered approaches to technology  
Balances critique with constructive problem-solving  
Allows for a range of responses, from simple habit changes to complex technological innovations  
Directly applies the module's concepts to personal life and potential future developments  
Bridges individual behavior with broader systemic thinking

This comprehensive approach should lead to a rich discussion that covers personal reflection, practical changes, and innovative thinking, all centered on the greatest commandment.
