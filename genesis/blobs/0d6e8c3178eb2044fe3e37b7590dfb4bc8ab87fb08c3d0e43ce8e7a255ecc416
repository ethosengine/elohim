Scenario: Appeal family intervention that strained trust
    Given Family Elohim alerted my partner about my behavioral changes
    And this intervention strained trust in our relationship
    And my partner now worries I'm being monitored
    When I file an appeal about the family impact of the intervention
    And I explain how "care" felt like "control" in our relationship
    Then the appeal is reviewed with family dynamics in mind
    And The Constitutional Council considers relationship impacts
    And They evaluate whether the intervention balanced individual autonomy with family care
    And They examine if less invasive options were considered
    And The family is offered mediation support to rebuild trust
    And Protocol recommendations address relationship preservation
