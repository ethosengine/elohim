Scenario: Activist documents municipal service delivery inequities
    Given the activist advocates for environmental justice
    And suspects systematic discrimination in service delivery
    When the Observer analyzes municipal operations patterns
    Then the activist sees infrastructure investment concentrated in white neighborhoods
    And pollution permits cluster in communities of color
    And code enforcement disparities by neighborhood
    And systematic racism becomes statistically undeniable
    And legal and political action gains foundation
