Scenario: Part-time employment with full benefits for caregivers
    Given James can only work part-time due to caregiving
    And loss of benefits creates devastating vulnerability
    When the workplace_elohim advocates for benefits policy
    Then part-time caregiver employees should access benefits
    And healthcare coverage should not require full-time employment
    And benefits should recognize caregiving as legitimate constraint
    And workplace should not force caregivers to choose between care and benefits
    And employment protection should include part-time caregivers
