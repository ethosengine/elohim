Scenario: Protecting Alex from neighborhood discrimination
    Given Alex may face discrimination or harassment from neighbors
    And ableism is pervasive in society
    When discrimination occurs
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should help Alex document incidents
    And it should connect Alex to legal resources and advocacy support
    And it should facilitate collective response from supportive neighbors
    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves
    And the protocol should recognize that neighborhoods can be hostile
    And safety resources should be readily available
    And Alex's right to live without discrimination should be defended
