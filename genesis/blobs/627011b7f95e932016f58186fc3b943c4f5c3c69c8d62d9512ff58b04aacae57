Scenario: Learning through Socratic questioning not direct instruction
    Given Emma is comparing two products
    And her personal_agent serves as teacher-guide
    When Emma seeks guidance on which to choose
    Then the agent should ask "What do you notice about these two options?"
    And the agent should follow up based on Emma's observations
    And the agent should ask "Which one do you think would work better for your family?"
    And direct instruction should be avoided
    And Emma should develop her own reasoning through inquiry
    And critical thinking should be built through question-based pedagogy
    And teaching should treat Emma as thinker, not rule-follower
