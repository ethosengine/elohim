Scenario: Elder shares cultural knowledge across generations
    Given Rose is second-generation Italian American
    And she knows traditional recipes and cultural practices
    When she joins a cultural preservation affinity network
    And she documents her grandmother's recipes with stories
    Then her contributions reach others interested in Italian American heritage
    And younger generations learn traditional knowledge
    And her cultural memory is preserved for future generations
    And Rose experiences pride in cultural contribution
    And intergenerational cultural transmission succeeds
