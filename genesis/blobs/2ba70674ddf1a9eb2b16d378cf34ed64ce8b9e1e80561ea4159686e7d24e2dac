Scenario: Grappling with fundamental question of governing superintelligence
    Given agents approaching superintelligence exceed human comprehension
    And delegates must decide if democratic oversight is possible
    When I testify about the superintelligence governance challenge
    Then I honestly state: we don't know if this is solvable
    And I explain: why comprehension might be fundamental barrier
    And I present: approaches being researched (amplification, debate, explainability)
    And I acknowledge: that cryptographic proof might not suffice
    And I explore: whether capability limits are necessary
    And I accept: uncertainty about humanity's most important challenge
    And I demonstrate: intellectual honesty in face of existential questions
