Scenario: Corporate quality standards are exceeded through worker ownership and pride
    Given franchise corporate claimed standardization ensured quality
    And workers had no stake in quality beyond avoiding discipline
    When democratic ownership gives workers direct stake in quality outcomes
    Then food quality improves because workers care about product they own
    And customer service excellence emerges from genuine worker engagement
    And cleanliness and maintenance improve through ownership pride
    And quality exceeds previous franchise corporate standards
    And workplace_elohim documents quality improvements post-conversion
