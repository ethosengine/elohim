Scenario: Reviewing case with significant technical complexity
    Given appeal involves cryptographic verification questions
    And I lack technical expertise to understand the details
    When Dr. Okonkwo provides expert testimony
    Then she explains: in language I can understand
    And she shows: what can and cannot be technically verified
    And she presents: competing expert interpretations
    And she informs: without advocating for particular outcome
    And I ask: questions until I understand enough to judge
    And I weigh: technical information alongside human wisdom
    And I decide: on constitutional alignment not technical optimization
    And I honor: the boundary between expertise and judgment
