Scenario: Informal elder checking and support network
    Given multiple seniors live in the neighborhood
    And Margaret is in the "younger" senior cohort
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates elder support
    Then Margaret should help check on older neighbors
    And she should receive checking from younger neighbors
    And gradual transitions in care needs should be supported
    And no senior should be isolated or unseen
    And neighborhood should notice if something is wrong
    And informal care networks should prevent crisis
