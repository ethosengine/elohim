Scenario: Traditional knowledge of food preservation and storage
    Given Margaret knows how to preserve food, reduce waste, maximize resources
    And these skills were essential in her generation
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks traditional ecological knowledge
    Then it should recognize Margaret's food preservation skills as valuable
    And it should value her knowledge of canning, freezing, storing food
    And it should facilitate teaching these skills to grandchildren
    And traditional knowledge should be documented and transmitted
    And Margaret's expertise should contribute to food security
    And ecological wisdom should accumulate care tokens
    And sustainable food practices should be valued and preserved
