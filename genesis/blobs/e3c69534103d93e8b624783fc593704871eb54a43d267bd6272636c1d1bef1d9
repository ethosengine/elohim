Scenario: Appealing resource allocation within family unit
    Given Family Elohim allocated household resources in a way I believe is unfair
    And I feel my needs were deprioritized compared to other family members
    When I appeal the resource allocation decision
    Then the agent must justify how it balanced competing family member needs
    And The Constitutional Council evaluates if constitutional principles were followed
    And They consider cultural context of family resource sharing
    And They examine if I had meaningful input into the decision process
    And The appeal can result in modified allocation or preference updates
    And Family members can collaboratively set allocation principles going forward
