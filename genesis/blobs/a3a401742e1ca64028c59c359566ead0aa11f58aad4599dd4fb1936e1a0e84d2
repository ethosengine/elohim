Scenario: Parent discovers teacher coalition on class size
    Given the board proposes increasing class sizes to save money
    And the parent opposes this for their child's learning
    When the Observer shows teacher union position on class sizes
    Then the parent sees teachers oppose increase for same reasons
    And understands research on class size impacts on learning
    And natural parent-teacher alliance against harmful policy becomes visible
    And coordinated parent-teacher testimony defeats the proposal
    And board cannot divide parents and teachers
