Scenario: Student privacy rights within family context
    Given Kenji is legal adult with full privacy rights
    And family relationships involve some appropriate information sharing
    When the family_elohim manages family information
    Then Kenji must have complete control over what family sees
    And parents should not have access to his personal data without consent
    And the system should respect his adult autonomy absolutely
    And family connection should not compromise privacy
    And Kenji should decide what to share with family
    And adult student privacy should be default, non-negotiable
