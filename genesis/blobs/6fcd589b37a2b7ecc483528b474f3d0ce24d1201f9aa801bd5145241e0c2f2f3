Scenario: Making visible that workers enable community flourishing
    Given community depends on workers' labor for functioning
    And workers are often invisible or undervalued
    When the community assesses what makes life possible
    Then the protocol should make visible workers' essential contributions
    And demonstrate that workers deserve dignity and fair compensation
    And build community consciousness about care labor embedded in all work
    And catalyze community support for worker justice and care economy principles
