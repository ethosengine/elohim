Scenario: Funding state grants for community protocol adoption
    Given poor communities cannot afford protocol infrastructure
    And equitable access requires public investment
    When I secure state budget allocation for protocol support
    Then I fund: grants for community nodes and maintenance
    And I support: accessibility enhancements and education
    And I provide: technical assistance for implementation
    And I ensure: sliding scale and cross-subsidization
    And I treat: protocol as democracy infrastructure deserving investment
    And I prevent: digital divide excluding marginalized communities
    And public funding: enables universal access to democratic governance tools
