Scenario: Planning across time with sophisticated coordination tools
    Given Marcus plans weekly meals for himself and Keisha
    And he must coordinate ingredients across multiple meals
    When Marcus uses planning features
    Then he should have access to meal planning with nutritional analysis
    And budget tracking should project across weeks
    And shopping list optimization should be available
    And inventory management should prevent waste
    And multi-store price comparison should support best value finding
    And planning tools should be professional-grade but accessible
