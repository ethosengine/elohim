Scenario: Bioregional knowledge transmitted across generations
    Given Jasmine learns from elders about local ecology and seasonal patterns
    And indigenous and long-term residents hold bioregional knowledge
    When she engages with bioregional wisdom holders
    Then bioregional_elohim should recognize knowledge transmission
    And value elder teaching as care work for ecological literacy
    And support intergenerational ecological knowledge sharing
    And help her understand that bioregional care includes cultural practices
    And connect her to deep knowledge about living in her specific place
    And demonstrate that care economy includes indigenous wisdom and ecological tradition
