Scenario: Applied learning through care economy translates to academic credit
    Given Jasmine manages household budget and coordinates care work
    And these activities involve mathematical reasoning, planning, and analysis
    When educational_elohim analyzes her care economy participation
    Then it should identify applicable learning in her care work
    And surface opportunities for academic recognition
    And connect to teachers: "Jasmine's budget management demonstrates applied math skills"
    And support translation of care contributions into academic credit where appropriate
    And recognize that learning happens across contexts, not just in classrooms
    And validate that care work develops genuine capabilities
