Scenario: Organizer coordinates block club coalition on neighborhood safety
    Given five block clubs care about pedestrian safety improvements
    And members work different shifts and speak different languages
    When the organizer uses Observer for coalition coordination
    Then all members see shared information base in their languages
    And can engage asynchronously on their schedules
    And track who's committed to testify at traffic commission
    And coordinate meeting attendance across 35 residents
    And coalition functions at scale without exhausting organizer
