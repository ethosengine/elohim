Scenario: Learning connection between budget constraints and farm labor
    Given Marcus experiences severe budget constraints
    And cheap food often reflects exploited farm labor
    When Marcus chooses affordable foods
    Then the personal_agent should help him understand pricing
    And it should explain that low prices often mean low wages for workers
    And it should build empathy for farm workers' care labor
    And Marcus should understand his scarcity connects to their scarcity
    And economic justice awareness should develop
    And care economy should include care for food system workers
