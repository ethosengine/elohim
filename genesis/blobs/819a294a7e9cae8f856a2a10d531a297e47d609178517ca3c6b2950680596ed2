Scenario: Municipal work-family policy advocacy based on personal navigation
    Given Robert balances intense career demands with family care
    And he's learned that work-family balance requires systemic support
    And municipal policy can support or hinder work-family balance
    When municipal_elohim supports his policy advocacy
    Then it should connect him to municipal work-family policy development
    And help him advocate for paid family leave, flexible work policies, and caregiver protections
    And surface opportunities to testify or serve on municipal commissions
    And recognize his experience as policy expertise
    And channel his voice toward municipal employment standards
    And build municipal support for working caregivers
    And demonstrate that care economy requires policy transformation
