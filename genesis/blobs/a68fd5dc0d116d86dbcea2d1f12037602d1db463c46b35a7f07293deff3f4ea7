Scenario: Appealing family privacy boundaries
    Given Family Elohim shares information between family members
    And I believe some information should remain private even within family
    When I appeal the information sharing protocols
    Then the Constitutional Council examines privacy expectations within families
    And They balance transparency needed for family care with individual privacy
    And They consider cultural norms about family information sharing
    And They evaluate if I had ability to set privacy boundaries beforehand
    And The appeal can establish individual privacy zones within family context
    And Family Elohim learns to respect graduated privacy based on information sensitivity
