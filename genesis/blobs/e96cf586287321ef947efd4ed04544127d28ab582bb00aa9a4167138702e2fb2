Scenario: Teacher reveals disciplinary policy impacts on students
    Given district implements zero-tolerance discipline policy
    And claims it improves school safety and learning environment
    When teachers track disciplinary policy impacts through Observer
    Then teachers document disproportionate impact on students of color
    And show suspensions increase rather than decrease behavior issues
    And demonstrate how exclusionary discipline harms student learning
    And propose restorative practices as evidence-based alternative
    And disciplinary policy becomes educational equity issue
