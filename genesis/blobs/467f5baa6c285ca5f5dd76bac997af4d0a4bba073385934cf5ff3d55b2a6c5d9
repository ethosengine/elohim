Scenario: Maintaining children's educational continuity during housing transitions
    Given I am moving between temporary housing or shelters
    And my children need stable educational engagement despite housing instability
    When we experience housing transitions
    Then the Value Scanner helps me understand children's educational rights (McKinney-Vento)
    And coordinates school enrollment, transfers, and records
    And ensures children can continue at current school if educationally beneficial
    And arranges transportation if needed for school continuity
    And tracks educational transitions and helps minimize disruption
    And my personal_agent manages school documentation and deadlines
    And recognizes educational coordination as substantial parenting labor
    And validates that maintaining school stability protects children
