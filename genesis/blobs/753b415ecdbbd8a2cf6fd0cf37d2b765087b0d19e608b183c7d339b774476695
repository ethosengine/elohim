Scenario: Maintaining identity beyond crisis circumstances
    Given I am defined by institutions as "domestic violence survivor" or "homeless person"
    And I am much more than my current circumstances
    When I interact with the Value Scanner
    Then the system recognizes my full humanity and complexity
    And documents my interests, skills, values, and dreams
    And reflects back my identity beyond crisis labels
    And helps me pursue aspects of life that matter to me
    And validates that crisis is something I'm experiencing, not who I am
    And my personal_agent knows and responds to my whole self
    And the care economy values me as complete person
    And my identity is not reduced to my vulnerability
