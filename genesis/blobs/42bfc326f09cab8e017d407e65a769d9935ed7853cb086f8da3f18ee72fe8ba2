Scenario: Neighborhood governance participation accessible to aging residents
    Given Frank is aging and may have mobility or accessibility needs
    And neighborhood governance should remain accessible
    When Frank participates in neighborhood governance
    Then meetings should be accessible (location, seating, acoustics)
    And remote participation options should be available
    And meeting materials should be provided in accessible formats
    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate accessibility needs
    And Frank should be able to participate fully despite aging
    And governance access should be universal, not assuming youth
    And his participation should be welcomed and supported
