Scenario: Neighborhood collective resources accessible to teen based on contribution
    Given the neighborhood has established collective resources
    And Jasmine has accumulated substantial care contributions
    When she needs to access neighborhood resources
    Then her care contributions should give her standing to access shared resources
    And she should be able to use neighborhood tool library, shared equipment, or collective resources
    And access should be based on demonstrated participation, not age
    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize her as a contributor with legitimate access
    And she should learn that care economy operates on reciprocity, not charity
    And her care tokens should be valid currency in neighborhood exchanges
