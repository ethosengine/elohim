Scenario: Ecosystem services from regenerative agriculture are measured and valued
    Given regenerative farms provide ecosystem services (water filtration, carbon storage, biodiversity)
    And these services traditionally went uncompensated despite community benefit
    When bioregional network documents and values ecosystem services
    Then water quality improvements from agricultural practices are measured and compensated
    And habitat provision for wildlife and pollinators is documented and valued
    And carbon sequestration generates revenue supporting regenerative practices
    And ecosystem service value enables regenerative agriculture to outcompete extractive industrial model
    And bioregional_elohim measures ecosystem services and facilitates compensation mechanisms
