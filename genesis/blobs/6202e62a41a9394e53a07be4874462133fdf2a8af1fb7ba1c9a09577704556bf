Scenario: Citizen forms coalition across municipal issue areas
    Given 230 families are losing time to bus delays
    And 47 teachers are concerned about school overcrowding
    And both issues stem from municipal transportation budget
    When the Observer detects the pattern connection
    Then citizens see the larger civic context
    And can coordinate with teachers and other affected groups
    And build more powerful coalition across stakeholder types
    And isolated concerns become coordinated advocacy
    And cross-issue patterns surface organically
