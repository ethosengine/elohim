Scenario: Maintaining capacity boundaries for sustainable care provision
    Given Margaret is 68 and has her own health considerations
    And excessive care burden could compromise her well-being
    When the personal_agent monitors Margaret's care load
    Then it should track whether care labor exceeds healthy capacity
    And it should alert if Margaret is sacrificing her own health
    And it should suggest when to renegotiate care arrangements
    And it should help her maintain sustainable care levels
    And Margaret should be able to provide care without burning out
    And the system should protect her well-being while valuing her contributions
    And capacity monitoring should enable long-term care sustainability
