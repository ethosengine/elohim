Scenario: Global appeal data informs protocol evolution
    Given millions of appeals have been filed globally over 7 years
    And researchers have analyzed patterns across cultures and contexts
    When Constitutional Convention reviews protocol effectiveness
    Then appeal success rates are examined (40% overturned or modified)
    And most common appeal types are identified (adolescent autonomy)
    And systematic biases are investigated
    And marginalized community outcomes are assessed
    And appellants' aggregate experience shapes constitutional amendments
    And protocol improvements are guided by lived experience at scale
