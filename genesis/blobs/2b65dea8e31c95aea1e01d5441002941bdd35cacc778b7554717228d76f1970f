Scenario: Intergenerational ecological wisdom includes disability experience
    Given disabled elders hold knowledge about adaptation and resilience
    And disability experience across generations teaches interdependence
    When ecological knowledge is preserved and transmitted
    Then the bioregional_elohim should include disability experience in wisdom traditions
    And Alex should be recognized as holder of valuable knowledge
    And disability wisdom should be passed to future generations
    And ecological teaching should include disability justice principles
    And the protocol should honor disability experience as ecological knowledge
    And Alex's understanding of interdependence should be preserved
    And intergenerational learning should include disability community wisdom
