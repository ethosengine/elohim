Scenario: Studying trust building through transparent governance
    Given trust in institutions is central question for democratic AI
    And Riverside provides natural experiment in transparency effects
    When I measure trust over time and mechanisms that build it
    Then I examine: whether seeing agent reasoning increases confidence
    And I explore: if meaningful recourse builds trust more than perfect decisions
    And I analyze: role of local Constitutional Council in legitimacy
    And I investigate: whether transparency enables manipulation or builds confidence
    And I track: how trust relationships between residents and agents evolve
    And My research tests: whether democratic governance of AI creates sustainable trust
    And Evidence informs: design of governance systems elsewhere
