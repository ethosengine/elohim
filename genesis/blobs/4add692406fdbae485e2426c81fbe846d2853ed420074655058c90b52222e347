Scenario: Personal agent prevents accessibility barriers proactively
    Given Alex encounters accessibility barriers constantly
    And the personal_agent monitors Alex's environment
    When Alex plans activities or purchases
    Then the agent should identify accessibility barriers in advance
    And it should provide information about accommodations available
    And it should suggest accessible alternatives when needed
    And it should help Alex advocate for improved accessibility
    And barrier documentation should support systems change advocacy
    And Alex should experience fewer surprises and obstacles
    And the protocol should reduce disability-related stress
