Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult
  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to coordinate care flows across multiple households and four generations
  So that family care responsibilities are distributed equitably and all family members flourish

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the middle-aged user "Robert" is registered in the system
    And Robert is 52 years old
    And his family spans four generations: grandchildren, children ages 19 and 22, himself and spouse, parents ages 78 and 75
    And the family governance context is active
    And family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy
    And family members live across three states

  Scenario: Multigenerational care coordination across distributed family
    Given Robert's parents live in Florida
    And his children attend college in different states
    And his grandchild occasionally needs care
    And Robert's siblings share parent care responsibilities
    When family_elohim coordinates care across geography
    Then it should track care needs across multiple households
    And coordinate with Robert's siblings on parent care distribution
    And help Robert support his children remotely
    And manage occasional grandchild care
    And surface conflicts across generational needs
    And provide sophisticated coordination across distance
    And ensure no household or person is overwhelmed

  Scenario: Parent care coordinated equitably with siblings
    Given Robert's parents require increasing care support
    And Robert has two siblings: Sarah and Michael
    And care coordination across siblings is often fraught
    When family_elohim coordinates sibling care contributions
    Then it should track each sibling's care contributions
    And make contributions visible to all siblings
    And surface when distribution becomes inequitable
    And facilitate discussion: "Robert has handled 65% of medical coordination this quarter"
    And help siblings negotiate fair distribution based on capacity
    And prevent resentment from invisible labor imbalances
    And support siblings in maintaining relationships while coordinating care

  Scenario: Adult children supported in independence while teaching care economy
    Given Robert's children ages 19 and 22 are establishing independence
    And Robert provides financial support, guidance, and care economy education
    When family_elohim tracks the parent-adult child relationship
    Then it should recognize Robert's support contributions
    And help him teach care economy principles to his children
    And surface opportunities: "Jordan could help coordinate grandmother's birthday celebration"
    And model multigenerational care reciprocity for the next generation
    And support the transition from parenting to adult partnership
    And help his children learn that care flows in multiple directions
    And prepare them to eventually care for him

  Scenario: Elder care financial coordination across family
    Given Robert's parents' care costs are increasing
    And long-term care may eventually be needed
    And financial planning needs to involve siblings
    When family_elohim coordinates elder care financing
    Then it should help siblings discuss financial responsibility
    And surface each sibling's capacity to contribute financially
    And track actual financial contributions to parent care
    And help coordinate long-term care insurance, Medicare, and family support
    And ensure parents' dignity is protected in financial discussions
    And prevent financial burden from falling entirely on one sibling
    And support transparent, equitable financial planning

  Scenario: Grandparent role supported as new generation emerges
    Given Robert occasionally provides care for his grandchild
    And he's learning the grandparent role
    And his care enables his adult child to work
    When family_elohim tracks grandparent care contributions
    Then it should recognize grandparent care as valuable family contribution
    And help Robert understand his role in the four-generation family
    And support him in providing care without overstepping parenting boundaries
    And recognize that his grandparent care enables the middle generation
    And value his care appropriately in family care economy
    And help him see himself as part of ongoing care reciprocity
    And model care patterns for when he'll need care

  Scenario: Family communication facilitated across generations and geography
    Given family members are distributed across states
    And communication about care needs is essential but complex
    And family discussions about care can be emotionally difficult
    When family_elohim supports family communication
    Then it should provide structured communication tools
    And facilitate difficult conversations about elder care, finances, and support
    And ensure all relevant family members have voice
    And help family navigate emotional complexity of care discussions
    And support family in making collaborative decisions
    And prevent communication breakdowns that harm care coordination
    And maintain family cohesion amid care demands

  Scenario: Family care tokens reflect four-generation care flows
    Given care flows in multiple directions across the family
    And Robert receives support from siblings and provides support to parents and children
    And care contributions need to be recognized across all flows
    When family_elohim calculates family care tokens
    Then it should track care across all four generations
    And recognize Robert's care for parents and support for children
    And value siblings' parent care contributions
    And recognize adult children's emerging care contributions
    And track grandparent care across the family
    And make visible the complex web of family care reciprocity
    And demonstrate that family functions through mutual care

  Scenario: Family governance decisions made collaboratively
    Given family faces major decisions about parent care
    And decisions affect multiple family members
    And Robert's voice carries weight but shouldn't dominate
    When family_elohim facilitates governance decisions
    Then it should support collaborative family decision-making
    And ensure Robert's parents have voice in their own care
    And include siblings in care planning decisions
    And respect adult children's emerging voice in family governance
    And help family navigate power dynamics and competing needs
    And support decisions that honor all family members' wellbeing
    And prevent decisions that sacrifice one generation for another

  Scenario: Elder care planning anticipates increasing needs
    Given Robert's parents are ages 78 and 75
    And their care needs will likely increase
    And family should plan proactively rather than react to crises
    When family_elohim supports elder care planning
    Then it should help family anticipate future care needs
    And surface: "Medical patterns suggest increased care needs likely within 2-3 years"
    And support family in discussing long-term care options
    And help siblings plan for potential crisis scenarios
    And ensure parents are included in planning with dignity
    And coordinate financial, medical, and housing planning
    And prevent family crisis from lack of preparation

  Scenario: Family care boundaries prevent burnout and exploitation
    Given Robert carries substantial family care burden
    And family care can become exploitative even with good intentions
    When family_elohim monitors care burden
    Then it should flag when Robert's care contributions exceed sustainable levels
    And recognize if siblings are not contributing equitably
    And surface if parents' needs are overwhelming family capacity
    And prompt discussion when external support is needed
    And protect Robert from being expected to handle everything
    And support family in recognizing when professional care is appropriate
    And ensure family care operates on reciprocity, not exploitation

  Scenario: Family history and care patterns made visible across generations
    Given care patterns often repeat across generations
    And Robert learned care from his parents' care for their parents
    And he's modeling care for the next generation
    When family_elohim surfaces family care history
    Then it should help Robert see multigenerational care patterns
    And recognize: "Your parents provided similar care for your grandparents"
    And surface how his current care teaches his children
    And connect past care received to present care given to future care needed
    And help family understand care as lifecycle reciprocity
    And validate that Robert's care continues family care traditions
    And prepare next generation to provide care when Robert needs it

  Scenario: Family privacy boundaries negotiated across generations
    Given family coordination requires information sharing
    And family members have legitimate need for privacy
    And Robert manages sensitive information about parents and children
    When family_elohim manages privacy
    Then it should enable coordination while protecting privacy
    And Robert should control what information he shares about his household
    And parents should maintain privacy about their health and finances
    And adult children should control their own information sharing
    And siblings should have access to parent care information
    And family care coordination should not violate individual privacy
    And privacy boundaries should be negotiable and respectful
