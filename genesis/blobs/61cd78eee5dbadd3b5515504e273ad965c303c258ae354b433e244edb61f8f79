Feature: Municipality Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person
  As a retired person in the value scanner system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want my civic participation valued and elder needs addressed in municipal policy
  So that retirement is recognized as continued citizenship and municipalities serve all ages

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the retired user "Frank" is registered in the system
    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction
    And Frank participates actively in municipal civic life
    And the municipality governance context is active
    And the municipal_elohim coordinates civic engagement and policy
    And Frank's volunteer work addresses needs municipal policy should handle

  Scenario: Volunteer labor addressing municipal housing needs quantified
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity
    And Habitat builds affordable housing the municipality fails to provide
    And his volunteer work substitutes for municipal housing policy
    When the municipal_elohim tracks housing care economy
    Then Frank's volunteer construction work should be quantified
    And aggregate volunteer labor should be calculated municipality-wide
    And data should reveal that volunteers provide housing infrastructure
    And municipal housing policy should recognize volunteer contributions
    And Frank's work should demonstrate need for municipal investment
    And volunteers should be understood as filling municipal policy gaps

  Scenario: Retired residents as civic engagement resource for municipal governance
    Given Frank has time freedom enabling substantial civic participation
    And many retired residents can attend daytime meetings and hearings
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates civic engagement
    Then it should recognize retired residents as civic participation resource
    And facilitate their attendance at municipal meetings and hearings
    And coordinate testimony and advocacy utilizing their availability
    And recognize civic engagement as care contribution
    And retired residents should be understood as democracy infrastructure
    And Frank should participate meaningfully in municipal governance
    And elder voice should shape municipal policy

  Scenario: Municipal care economy data informs retirement policy
    Given Frank's care contributions are tracked through Value Scanner
    And municipal data reveals aggregate retired resident contributions
    When the municipal_elohim analyzes retirement care economy
    Then it should quantify total volunteer labor from retired residents
    And calculate market value of unpaid care work (~millions annually)
    And surface that retired residents provide massive municipal value
    And inform policy recognizing caregiving in benefit calculations
    And demonstrate that retirement is transition to care work, not exit from contribution
    And support municipal policy that values and supports retired residents

  Scenario: Municipal services accessibility for aging residents
    Given Frank is aging and may have mobility or transportation limitations
    And municipal services should remain accessible to all residents
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates service accessibility
    Then it should ensure public buildings are physically accessible
    And public transit should serve aging residents' mobility needs
    And municipal services should be available in formats accessible to aging users
    And digital services should accommodate aging-related changes
    And Frank should access municipal services with dignity
    And universal design should serve residents across lifespan

  Scenario: Municipal food security programs recognize retired residents on fixed income
    Given Frank lives on $28k/year fixed income
    And food costs are significant portion of limited budget
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates food security
    Then Frank should access municipal food programs without stigma
    And his care contributions should be visible in program eligibility
    And food assistance should be framed as reciprocity, not charity
    And municipal programs should recognize his volunteer contributions
    And care economy should connect to food security infrastructure
    And Frank should experience dignity in accessing food resources

  Scenario: Municipal public transit serves retired residents without car access
    Given Frank may not be able to afford car ownership
    And he relies on public transit and walking
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates transportation
    Then public transit should serve Frank's mobility needs effectively
    And routes and schedules should accommodate non-employment patterns
    And transit should enable access to medical, social, and civic destinations
    And affordable transit should support continued community participation
    And Frank should maintain mobility and independence through public infrastructure
    And municipal transportation should serve residents across lifespan

  Scenario: Municipal recreation and social programs prevent elder isolation
    Given Frank needs social connection to maintain wellbeing
    And isolation increases with age without intentional connection
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates social infrastructure
    Then it should provide programs connecting retired residents
    And senior centers should be framed as community hubs, not warehouses
    And programs should facilitate continued contribution and purpose
    And Frank should access social connection through municipal infrastructure
    And elder isolation should be prevented through public programs
    And municipal policy should recognize social connection as health infrastructure

  Scenario: Municipal planning includes elder wisdom and long-term perspective
    Given Frank has lived in the municipality for decades
    And he's observed long-term patterns and changes
    When the municipal_elohim facilitates planning processes
    Then it should actively seek Frank's long-term perspective
    And elder wisdom should inform infrastructure and policy decisions
    And decades of observation should guide municipal adaptation
    And Frank's experience should be valued in planning conversations
    And municipal governance should benefit from elder knowledge
    And intergenerational planning should integrate experienced voices

  Scenario: Municipal healthcare coordination supports aging residents
    Given Frank and his wife both have aging-related healthcare needs
    And navigating healthcare is increasingly complex
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates healthcare access
    Then it should help Frank navigate Medicare and healthcare systems
    And coordinate with municipal health services
    And support access to preventive and chronic care
    And connect healthcare to care economy support systems
    And Frank should maintain health through accessible municipal infrastructure
    And municipal health policy should serve aging residents effectively

  Scenario: Municipal emergency preparedness utilizes retired residents' availability
    Given Frank has daytime availability and construction skills
    And municipalities need emergency response capacity
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates emergency preparedness
    Then it should include retired residents in emergency planning
    And utilize their skills and availability for emergency response
    And coordinate community-level resilience with municipal systems
    And recognize retired residents as municipal emergency resource
    And Frank should contribute meaningfully to collective safety
    And municipal preparedness should leverage care economy networks

  Scenario: Municipal recognition of informal care work in economic indicators
    Given Frank provides substantial unpaid care work
    And traditional municipal economic indicators ignore care economy
    When the municipal_elohim tracks economic activity
    Then it should include care work in municipal economic reporting
    And Frank's volunteer labor should be counted in economic indicators
    And municipal GDP should reflect care economy contributions
    And retirement should be understood as economic participation
    And policy should be based on complete economic picture
    And Frank's contributions should be visible in municipal economics

  Scenario: Municipal housing policy supports aging in place
    Given Frank wants to age in his community
    And housing costs are significant on fixed income
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates housing policy
    Then it should support policies enabling aging in place
    And affordable housing should serve retired residents on fixed income
    And Frank should not be displaced by rising housing costs
    And municipal policy should recognize his decades of community contribution
    And housing should be treated as right, not commodity
    And care economy contributions should inform housing access
