Scenario: Accessing crisis resources without losing dignity
    Given I need immediate assistance with food and housing
    And I am worried about stigma and degradation
    When I access support through the care economy network
    Then resources are provided based on my care contributions, not means-testing
    And I am treated as a community member deserving support
    And there is no requirement to prove I'm "needy enough"
    And I don't have to expose private trauma to gatekeepers
    And assistance is framed as reciprocal care, not charity
    And the system recognizes my parenting labor as valuable contribution
    And my dignity is preserved throughout the support process
    And I maintain my standing as a person, not a "case"
