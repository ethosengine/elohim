Scenario: Collective organizing with other disabled workers
    Given disabled workers face common workplace barriers
    And collective action is more powerful than individual advocacy
    When Alex connects with other disabled workers
    Then the workplace_elohim should facilitate disabled worker organizing
    And it should help Alex build solidarity with other disabled employees
    And collective accommodation requests should be coordinated
    And workplace accessibility improvements should benefit all disabled workers
    And the protocol should support disability labor organizing
    And collective power should be built for systemic workplace change
    And Alex should be connected to broader disability labor rights movements
