Scenario: Teen participates in neighborhood care patterns as full member
    Given Jasmine's neighborhood has established care economy practices
    And she has accumulated care contributions across contexts
    When Jasmine engages neighborhood-level activities
    Then she should be recognized as a full participant, not a future member
    And her care contributions should aggregate with neighbors' contributions
    And she should have access to neighborhood collective resources
    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize her as a constitutional participant
    And her voice should matter in neighborhood decisions
    And she should experience being a valued member of her neighborhood community
