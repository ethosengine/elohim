Scenario: Building community solidarity with other workers
    Given workers across community face similar exploitation
    When we want to organize collective support and advocacy
    Then the protocol should connect workers across industries
    And facilitate worker mutual aid and solidarity networks
    And support collective action for better conditions
    And build worker power through community organization
