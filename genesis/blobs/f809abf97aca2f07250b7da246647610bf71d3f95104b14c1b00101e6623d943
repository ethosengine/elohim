Scenario: Pushing for industry scheduling regulations
    Given unpredictable scheduling is endemic in food service
    When workers advocate for fair scheduling laws
    Then the protocol should support advocacy for scheduling regulations
    Such as advance notice requirements, predictable hours, right to request schedule
    And provide evidence of harm from current scheduling practices
    And coordinate workers pushing for legislative change
    And transform industry standards through policy intervention
