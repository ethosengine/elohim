Scenario: Household planning for both partners' future aging
    Given Robert and Jennifer are preparing for their own eventual aging
    And they watch their parents navigate aging challenges
    And they need to build resources for their own care
    When household_elohim supports retirement and aging planning
    Then it should help them plan for joint aging
    And coordinate long-term care insurance, retirement housing, and care resources
    And surface: "Your parents' care patterns suggest you should plan for similar needs"
    And help them build care economy resources that will serve them later
    And ensure they're preparing for aging with dignity
    And support building care networks that will remain as they age
    And prevent them from sacrificing their future for present demands
