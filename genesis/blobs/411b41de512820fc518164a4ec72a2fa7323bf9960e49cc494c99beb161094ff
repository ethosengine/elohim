Scenario: Campus environmental advocacy as ecological care work
    Given Kenji's college has environmental impact and policies
    And students can advocate for institutional sustainability
    When Kenji participates in campus environmental organizing
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize advocacy as ecological care work
    And it should accumulate care tokens for environmental activism
    And it should value organizing for institutional change
    And it should recognize that systemic change requires collective action
    And the system should support student environmental advocacy
    And campus organizing should be understood as ecological care economy work
