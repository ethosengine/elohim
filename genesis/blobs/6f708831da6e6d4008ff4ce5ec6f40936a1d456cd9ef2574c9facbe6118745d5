Scenario: Journalist compares city policies to neighboring municipalities
    Given city council debates new approach to homelessness
    And politicians claim no alternatives exist
    When the Observer provides comparative policy analysis
    Then the journalist sees 3 nearby cities using housing-first approach
    And reviews outcome data showing reduced homelessness
    And finds cost comparison showing housing cheaper than criminalization
    And interviews officials in cities with successful programs
    And publishes story presenting evidence-based alternatives
