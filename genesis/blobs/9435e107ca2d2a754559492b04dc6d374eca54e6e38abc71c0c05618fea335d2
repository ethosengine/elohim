Scenario: Recognizing that student patterns shape adult life
    Given Kenji is forming habits and patterns that will persist
    And his college years are when adult identity and practices solidify
    When the personal_agent reflects on Kenji's pattern development
    Then it should help him see that current choices shape future self
    And it should validate that learning care economy now matters lifelong
    And it should recognize this developmental phase as formative
    And the agent should support intentional pattern-building
    And the system should help Kenji become the adult he wants to be
    And student years should be recognized as foundation-laying time
