Scenario: Ecological wisdom from lifetime of experience
    Given Helen has observed environmental changes over 82 years
    And her generation has knowledge of pre-industrial practices
    When Helen shares ecological knowledge
    Then her observations should inform environmental education
    And traditional sustainable practices should be preserved
    And her lifetime of data should be valued in climate education
    And care tokens should reflect her contribution to ecological stewardship
    And the protocol should recognize elders as environmental historians
    And ecological education should include elder perspectives
    And Helen's knowledge should contribute to community sustainability
