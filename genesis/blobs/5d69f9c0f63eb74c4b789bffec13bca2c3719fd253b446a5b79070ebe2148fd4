Feature: School-Level Teacher Voice and Conditions for Teacher
  As a teacher in the public_observer system
  Operating at the school governance layer
  I want to contribute professional expertise without retaliation
  So that school decisions reflect classroom realities and student needs

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teacher user is registered in the system
    And the school governance context is active

  Scenario: Teacher reports curriculum concerns anonymously
    Given the principal mandates instructional approach contradicting research
    And the teacher knows this won't work for students
    When the teacher reports concern through Observer anonymously
    Then the contribution is documented without revealing identity
    And pattern detection shows 45 other teachers share concern
    And school leadership sees collective professional judgment
    And curriculum decision is reconsidered based on teacher expertise
    And teacher voice emerges without individual retaliation risk

  Scenario: Teacher documents inadequate support staff
    Given the school lacks sufficient counselors and specialists
    And students with learning needs aren't getting services
    When teachers collectively document support staff gaps through Observer
    Then aggregated data shows 300 students per counselor vs 250 recommended
    And student impact patterns become visible
    And teachers coordinate advocacy with parents for resources
    And principal takes evidence to district for staffing increase
    And professional knowledge drives resource allocation

  Scenario: Teacher participates in school policy decisions
    Given the school site council is revising discipline policy
    And teachers have frontline knowledge about what works
    When the Observer facilitates teacher input on policy options
    Then teachers share evidence-based practices anonymously
    And successful approaches from other schools are surfaced
    And student outcome data informs policy design
    And final policy reflects teacher professional expertise
    And school governance becomes genuinely participatory

  Scenario: Teacher reveals disparate working conditions
    Given some teachers have adequate planning time while others don't
    And resource distribution within school is inequitable
    When the Observer documents working conditions by department
    Then disparities become visible (English: 45min planning, Math: 90min)
    And teachers identify structural causes vs individual complaints
    And principal sees evidence requiring fair scheduling
    And working conditions equity improves school-wide
    And transparency drives fairness

  Scenario: Teacher coordinates with parents on class sizes
    Given increasing class sizes harm individualized attention
    And parents don't realize it's a policy choice not teacher preference
    When the Observer connects teacher insights with parent concerns
    Then parents learn class sizes increased from 22 to 28 this year
    And teachers provide evidence on learning impacts
    And teacher-parent coalition advocates to principal and district
    And shared understanding replaces parent-teacher tension
    And cross-stakeholder coalition creates accountability pressure

  Scenario: Teacher tracks administrator promises
    Given the principal promised to reduce paperwork burden
    And six months have passed
    When the Observer tracks promise implementation
    Then teachers document paperwork actually increased 15%
    And evidence shows gap between promise and reality
    And teachers bring accountability data to next site council
    And administrator either delivers on commitment or explains why not
    And promises become enforceable through transparency
