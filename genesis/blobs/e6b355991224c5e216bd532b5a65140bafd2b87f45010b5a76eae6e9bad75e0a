Scenario: Pension board member understands worker and community concerns on investment
    Given pension fund invests in companies with controversial labor practices
    And beneficiaries and community members raise concerns at board meeting
    And board wants to understand stakeholder perspectives beyond who testified
    When the board member seeks community accountability data from Observer
    Then they receive survey data from pension beneficiaries on investment priorities
    And see worker concerns about fund investments in companies with poor labor records
    And access analysis of investment alignment with beneficiary values
    And understand community impacts of fund investment decisions
    And community accountability helps board consider stakeholder interests
