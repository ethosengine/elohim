Scenario: Senior learning programs adapted for cognitive accessibility
    Given Helen participates in senior learning programs
    And her cognitive and physical capabilities require accommodation
    When Helen engages with educational content
    Then programs should be paced for senior learners
    And materials should use large fonts and high contrast
    And voice content should be available alongside visual
    And no time pressure should be imposed
    And learning should be meaningful, not make-work
    And the protocol should ensure education remains accessible at all ages
    And Helen should experience genuine learning, not patronizing activities
