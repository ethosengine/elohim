Scenario: Teaching about aging and mortality to younger generations
    Given Helen faces mortality consciously
    And younger generations need education about aging and death
    When Helen shares her experience of aging
    Then this should be recognized as valuable teaching
    And younger people should learn from her direct experience
    And education about mortality should come from those facing it
    And Helen should be recognized as expert on her own aging
    And the protocol should facilitate difficult but necessary conversations
    And death education should be normalized through elder participation
    And Helen's voice should teach community about aging with dignity
