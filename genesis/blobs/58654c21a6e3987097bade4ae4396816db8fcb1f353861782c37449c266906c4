Scenario: Family resource allocation based on care contributions
    Given Sarah contributes enormous care labor to family
    And family resources are finite
    When the family makes resource allocation decisions
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her standing
    And her care tokens should influence family governance
    And those who do care work should have voice in resource decisions
    And family economics should reflect care economy principles
    And Sarah should not be economically dependent despite unpaid care work
    And the system should enable care-based family governance
