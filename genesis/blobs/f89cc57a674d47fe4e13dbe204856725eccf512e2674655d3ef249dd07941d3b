Scenario: Coordinating care for family members I support
    Given I may have dependents or family I support financially
    When my care responsibilities extend beyond myself
    Then the protocol should help me coordinate care for dependents
    And optimize limited resources across family needs
    And connect me to support systems for working families
    And recognize that work-family balance requires systemic support
