Scenario: Customer trust relationships institutionalize through democratic governance
    Given customers bring cars to Rosa because of 15 years of personal trust
    And trust was built through honest work, fair pricing, and community care
    When ownership transitions from individual to democratic
    Then customer histories are documented (with privacy protection)
    And workers inherit trust relationships through Rosa's introduction
    And customers learn their support now benefits worker-owners, not distant capital
    And democratic governance creates transparency deepening trust
    And community_elohim ensures trust institutionalizes beyond individual owner
