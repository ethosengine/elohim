Scenario: Household governance decisions made as equal partners
    Given Frank and his wife are equal partners in household
    And both contribute care labor and have voice in decisions
    When household decisions are made
    Then the household_elohim should support collaborative decision-making
    And neither partner should dominate household governance
    And both partners' preferences and needs should have equal weight
    And retirement should enable true partnership, not hierarchy
    And household decisions should serve both partners' flourishing
    And equitable partnership should be structurally supported
