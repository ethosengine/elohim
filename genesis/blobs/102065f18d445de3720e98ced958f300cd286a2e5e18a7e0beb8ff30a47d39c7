Scenario: Responsible developer partners with district for school capacity
    Given a developer understands project will strain school capacity
    And wants to genuinely address educational impacts
    When the Observer facilitates developer-district partnership
    Then the developer negotiates: $3M contribution to school expansion
    And commits land for future school site if district needs it
    And provides temporary modular classrooms during construction of expansion
    And partnership creates genuine school capacity not just promises
    And responsible development addresses community needs
