Scenario: Medical record integration for comprehensive care coordination
    Given David's medical information is scattered across providers
    And comprehensive view is essential for good care
    When the healthcare_elohim accesses medical records
    Then it should integrate information across healthcare systems
    And James should have complete medical picture
    And providers should receive comprehensive information
    And medical record fragmentation should be addressed
    And care coordination should be supported by integrated data
