Scenario: Family cultural and value transmission across generations
    Given Kenji learned family values and culture growing up
    And he is now interpreting these in young adult context
    When Kenji participates in family cultural practices
    Then the family_elohim should recognize his work maintaining culture
    And it should value his adaptation of family traditions to college life
    And it should support intergenerational transmission of family values
    And cultural work should be recognized as family care labor
    And the system should value students as culture carriers
    And family identity should persist across geographic separation
