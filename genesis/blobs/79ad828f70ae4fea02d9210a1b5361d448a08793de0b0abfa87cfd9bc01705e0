Scenario: Food waste reduction serves both budget and ecology
    Given Marcus must maximize value from $75 budget
    And food waste represents economic and ecological loss
    When Marcus manages food inventory
    Then the personal_agent should help him minimize waste
    And it should track what gets used and what spoils
    And it should suggest meal planning that uses ingredients completely
    And waste reduction should serve both his budget and environment
    And ecological stewardship should align with economic necessity
    And care for resources should extend to caring for earth
