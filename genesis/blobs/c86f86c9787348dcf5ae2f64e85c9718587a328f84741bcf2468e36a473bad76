Scenario: Managing catastrophically tight household budget
    Given I have temporary assistance, unreliable child support, and no employment yet
    And I need to provide for two children on insufficient resources
    When I plan household spending for the month
    Then the Value Scanner helps me allocate resources across competing needs
    And prioritizes nutrition, safety, and children's essential needs
    And surfaces local resources and assistance I might be eligible for
    And helps me track spending without shame or judgment
    And identifies where I can optimize without sacrificing children's wellbeing
    And my personal_agent alerts me to upcoming expenses before they become crises
    And recognizes my resource management as sophisticated financial labor
    And validates that I'm making the best possible choices under extreme constraint
