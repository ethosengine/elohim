Scenario: Citizen connects to regional environmental patterns
    Given tree canopy loss is occurring in the citizen's neighborhood
    When the Observer surfaces regional ecological data
    Then the citizen learns this is part of citywide pattern
    And sees which areas retain or lose environmental quality
    And discovers other neighborhoods facing similar concerns
    And can join broader environmental coalition
    And local environmental concerns connect to systemic patterns
