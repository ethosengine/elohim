Scenario: Journalist investigates municipal service delivery disparities
    Given residents in certain neighborhoods report neglected infrastructure
    And the journalist suspects systematic discrimination
    When the Observer analyzes municipal operations by neighborhood
    Then the journalist sees pothole repairs average 2 days in white areas
    And same repairs take 47 days in Black neighborhoods
    And code enforcement targets rental properties in immigrant communities
    And documents service quality correlating with neighborhood race and income
    And publishes investigation exposing structural racism in city operations
