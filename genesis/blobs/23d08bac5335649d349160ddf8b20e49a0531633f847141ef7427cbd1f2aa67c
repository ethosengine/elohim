Scenario: Municipal care economy data informs state and federal policy
    Given Riverside municipality has comprehensive care economy data
    And thousands of teens participate in tracked care contributions
    When state or federal policymakers study youth economics
    Then municipal_elohim should provide anonymized aggregate data
    And demonstrate economic value of teen care contributions at scale
    And inform policy about youth employment, education, and wellbeing
    And show that care economy framework reveals invisible youth labor
    And support evidence-based policy at higher governance levels
    And contribute to national conversation about youth participation in economy
