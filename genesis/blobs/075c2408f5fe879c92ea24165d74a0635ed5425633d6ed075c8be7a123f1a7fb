Scenario: Workers democratically decide on operational schedules
    Given scheduling was previously dictated by management
    And workers had no input on shift assignments
    When the democratic workplace holds a scheduling governance session
    Then Maria proposes a schedule balancing operational needs with worker life needs
    And DeShawn suggests modifications for his college class schedule
    And workers vote on the proposed schedule with governance weight based on seniority and contribution
    And the approved schedule is implemented immediately
    And no manager can override the democratic decision
