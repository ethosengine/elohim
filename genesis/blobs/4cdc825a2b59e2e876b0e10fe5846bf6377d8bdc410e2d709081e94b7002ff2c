Scenario: Managing shared grocery shopping efficiently
    Given household members pool resources for shared groceries
    And I have limited time for shopping due to work
    When the household needs groceries
    Then the protocol should optimize shared shopping lists
    And coordinate who shops when based on availability
    And track shared expenses fairly
    And minimize my individual shopping burden through cooperation
