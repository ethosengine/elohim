Scenario: Address climate refugee resettlement at municipal scale
    Given climate refugees are arriving faster than housing can accommodate
    And Municipal Elohim coordinates capacity mapping
    When Jamal works with agent on integration strategy
    Then agent matches refugee skills to job availability
    And agent suggests phased integration by neighborhood
    And agent monitors integration outcomes for adjustment
    And Jamal ensures community voice in resettlement decisions
    And integration succeeds better than without coordination
    And Riverside demonstrates scalable humanitarian response
