Scenario: Family care coordination prevents burnout and exploitation
    Given Frank provides substantial family care across contexts
    And care work can become exploitative even within families
    When family_elohim monitors Frank's care burden
    Then it should flag when contributions exceed sustainable levels
    And surface if family is taking advantage without reciprocation
    And recognize if Frank is sacrificing his wellbeing for family
    And prompt discussions about fair distribution
    And protect Frank from exploitation through visibility
    And ensure family care operates on reciprocity, not extraction
    And support Frank in maintaining boundaries
