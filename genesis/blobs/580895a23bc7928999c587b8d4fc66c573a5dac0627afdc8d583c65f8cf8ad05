Scenario: Workplace skills integrated with broader capability development
    Given Jasmine learns customer service, inventory management, and problem-solving at work
    And these skills transfer to other contexts
    When her personal_agent tracks skill development
    Then it should recognize skills gained through work
    And surface how workplace skills apply to other life contexts
    And connect to educational and career planning
    And help her see work as capability building, not just income
    And integrate workplace learning with her overall development
    And value skills development as part of work's worth
