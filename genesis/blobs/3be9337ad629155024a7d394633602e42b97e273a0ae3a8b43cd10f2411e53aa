Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces costs and builds connection
    Given Robert has tools, equipment, and skills
    And buying everything individually is expensive and wasteful
    And neighbors have resources that Robert occasionally needs
    When neighborhood_elohim facilitates resource sharing
    Then it should coordinate tool libraries, equipment sharing, and skill exchange
    And track contributions: "Robert has lent tools 12 times, borrowed 8 times"
    And reduce household expenses through sharing
    And build relationships through resource exchange
    And demonstrate care economy principles at neighborhood scale
    And reduce consumption through sharing economy
    And strengthen neighborhood bonds through mutual support
