Scenario: Teacher coordinates with parents on class sizes
    Given increasing class sizes harm individualized attention
    And parents don't realize it's a policy choice not teacher preference
    When the Observer connects teacher insights with parent concerns
    Then parents learn class sizes increased from 22 to 28 this year
    And teachers provide evidence on learning impacts
    And teacher-parent coalition advocates to principal and district
    And shared understanding replaces parent-teacher tension
    And cross-stakeholder coalition creates accountability pressure
