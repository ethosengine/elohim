    Given the politician represents working-class district
    And hears business community claim workers are thriving
    When the Observer analyzes local economic and wage patterns

    And identify workers holding multiple jobs to survive
    And understand constituent economic stress beyond unemployment numbers
    And learn which industries pay poverty wages requiring public assistance
    And champion worker-centered economic policy with evidence
