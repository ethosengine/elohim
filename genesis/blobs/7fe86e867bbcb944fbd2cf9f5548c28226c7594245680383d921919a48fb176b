Scenario: Investor participates in community investment pool governance
    Given traditional investing gives shareholders plutocratic pseudo-democracy
    And Patricia wants genuine participation, not capital-weighted control
    When community investment pool has democratic governance structure
    Then she participates in pool governance as one voice among equals
    And investment decisions consider community benefit alongside financial returns
    And pool priorities are set democratically by investors, workers, and community representatives
    And governance prevents capital from dominating democratic enterprises
    And community_elohim manages investment pool democratic governance
