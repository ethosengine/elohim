Scenario: Community food security programs integrated with Value Scanner
    Given Marcus manages food budget under severe constraints
    And community food security programs exist
    When Marcus's nutritional patterns indicate need
    Then the community_elohim should connect him to food programs
    And integration should be seamless, not requiring separate applications
    And his care contributions should establish eligibility
    And programs should be framed as community care exchanges
    And access should not require stigmatizing means testing
    And food security should be treated as community responsibility
