Scenario: Senior experience and knowledge informs community governance
    Given Margaret has decades of community involvement
    And she understands local history, patterns, and relationships
    When community decisions are being made
    Then Margaret's knowledge should be actively solicited
    And her voice should carry weight in governance processes
    And senior wisdom should inform community planning
    And decades of experience should be treated as valuable resource
    And community governance should benefit from long-term perspective
    And Margaret should have legitimate authority in civic decisions
