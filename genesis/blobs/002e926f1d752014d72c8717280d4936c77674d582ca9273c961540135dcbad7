Scenario: Activist connects local environmental struggle to regional climate justice
    Given the activist fights pollution in their neighborhood
    When the Observer reveals regional climate adaptation patterns
    Then the activist sees climate resilience investments favor wealthy areas
    And flood vulnerability concentrates in communities of color
    And urban heat island effects exacerbate environmental injustice
    And local environmental fight connects to climate justice movement
    And climate policy must address environmental equity
