Scenario: Communication and decision-making supported amid stress
    Given Robert and Jennifer are both under substantial stress
    And care demands can strain even strong partnerships
    And important household decisions must be made collaboratively
    When household_elohim facilitates communication
    Then it should provide structured decision-making support
    And ensure both partners have voice in household governance
    And surface when stress is affecting communication
    And prompt for check-ins: "You haven't had a planning conversation in 3 weeks"
    And support them in maintaining partnership health
    And recognize that their relationship needs protection amid care demands
    And prevent household governance breakdown under stress
