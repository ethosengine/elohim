Scenario: Business operations maintain continuity during ownership transition
    Given customers depend on reliable auto repair service
    And continuity protects both community institution and workers' livelihoods
    When ownership structure transforms from individual to democratic
    Then customer relationships are systematically introduced to workers as new decision-makers
    And service quality remains consistent through documented procedures
    And supplier relationships transfer with Rosa introducing workers personally
    And equipment maintenance knowledge is shared and documented
    And no disruption occurs to daily operations or customer service
