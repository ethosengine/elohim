Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver
  As a caregiver coordinating care across family relationships
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want family care complexity visible and supported across generations
  So that family care economy sustains multiple care relationships simultaneously

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the caregiver user "James" is registered in the system
    And James cares for husband David (52) with early-onset Alzheimer's
    And James also coordinates care for his mother (76, recently widowed)
    And James has relationships with David's parents and extended family
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy
    And James navigates complex family dynamics amid intensive caregiving

  Scenario: Sandwich generation care burden made visible across family
    Given James cares simultaneously for spouse and aging parent
    And he provides intensive care in both directions
    When the family_elohim tracks James's care contributions
    Then his care work for David should be quantified fully
    And his care coordination for his mother should be visible
    And extended family should see his dual care burden
    And sandwich generation reality should be recognized explicitly
    And family should understand the overwhelming scope of James's labor
    And visibility should enable family support rather than more demands

  Scenario: Spousal care recognized as professional-grade family contribution
    Given James provides skilled nursing-level care for David
    And this care is rendered invisible because they're married
    When the family_elohim evaluates James's spousal care
    Then it should be valued at professional care rates
    And care tokens should reflect $50k+/year equivalent value
    And "caring for spouse out of love" should not erase economic value
    And family should recognize James is doing professional work
    And spousal caregiving should be visible as enormous contribution
    And marriage should not make care work economically invisible

  Scenario: Family boundary management as care recipient's family intrudes
    Given David's parents have opinions about his care
    And they may question James's decisions
    When family boundaries are negotiated
    Then the family_elohim should support James's care authority
    And it should recognize him as primary caregiver and spouse
    And it should help James maintain appropriate boundaries
    And David's family should provide support, not interference
    And family governance should respect caregiving relationship
    And boundaries should be clear when family dynamics become difficult

  Scenario: Care coordination with James's mother while caring for David
    Given James's mother (76) needs increasing support
    And James is already overwhelmed caring for David
    When James coordinates care for his mother
    Then the family_elohim should help him manage both relationships
    And it should recognize he cannot provide intensive care in both directions
    And it should help coordinate additional support for his mother
    And it should prevent James from collapsing under dual burden
    And family care should be sustainable across multiple recipients

  Scenario: Extended family contributions distributed equitably
    Given James carries enormous family care burden
    And other family members could provide some support
    When the family_elohim analyzes family care distribution
    Then it should identify who is doing what
    And it should make visible that James is carrying most burden
    And it should prevent care from falling entirely on one person
    And it should enable equitable distribution negotiations
    And family care should be shared fairly, not concentrated

  Scenario: Family financial support recognition as care contribution
    Given James's household income has plummeted due to caregiving
    And family members may provide financial assistance
    When family financial support is tracked
    Then the family_elohim should recognize financial help as care contribution
    And it should value financial support alongside direct care labor
    And family members unable to provide direct care can contribute financially
    And care economy should include multiple forms of contribution
    And financial support should be recognized, not taken for granted

  Scenario: Family grief support as David's condition progresses
    Given entire family grieves David's decline
    And James's grief is compounded by providing daily care
    When the family_elohim recognizes collective family grief
    Then it should connect family to grief support resources
    And it should acknowledge progressive loss affects everyone
    And it should coordinate family emotional support for each other
    And James should receive family support, not just provide care
    And family should process grief together while supporting James

  Scenario: In-law family dynamics around David's care
    Given David's parents struggle with their son's diagnosis
    And they may have complicated feelings about James's caregiving
    When the family_elohim navigates in-law relationships
    Then it should recognize complex family dynamics
    And it should support James's relationship with David's family
    And it should help manage their grief without undermining James
    And in-law relationships should be supportive of James's caregiving
    And family care economy should include chosen family bonds

  Scenario: Family care legacy planning as David's condition progresses
    Given David's condition will continue to worsen
    And James may eventually need institutional care support
    When family plans for David's future care
    Then the family_elohim should facilitate family care planning
    And it should help family discuss difficult future scenarios
    And it should coordinate family resources for potential needs
    And family should plan together for multiple care scenarios
    And care legacy planning should involve whole family

  Scenario: Family respite coordination to prevent James's burnout
    Given James needs regular respite or he will collapse
    And family members could provide some respite care
    When the family_elohim coordinates respite
    Then it should identify family members who could help
    And it should schedule regular respite periods
    And it should ensure James gets breaks from intensive care
    And family should actively provide respite, not just sympathy
    And respite coordination should be systematic, not ad hoc

  Scenario: Sibling coordination for mother's care to prevent overwhelming James
    Given James's siblings also have responsibility for their mother
    And James is already overwhelmed with David's care
    When the family_elohim tracks sibling care contributions
    Then it should ensure siblings share mother's care equitably
    And it should prevent care from defaulting entirely to James
    And it should coordinate among siblings for fair distribution
    And James's dual burden should not excuse siblings from contributing
    And family care should be distributed based on capacity

  Scenario: Family cultural recognition of caregiving as sacred work
    Given some cultural traditions honor caregiving as sacred
    And family culture may recognize James's care work meaningfully
    When the family_elohim tracks cultural care values
    Then it should recognize cultural frameworks that honor caregiving
    And it should support family cultural practices around care
    And cultural recognition should supplement economic recognition
    And diverse family cultures should be respected and valued
    And care economy should align with family cultural values
