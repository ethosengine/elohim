Scenario: Regenerative consumption replaces extractive consumption patterns
    Given traditional consumption extracts from ecological systems
    And Sarah wants to shift to regenerative practices
    When Sarah makes consumption choices over time
    Then the bioregional_elohim should guide toward regenerative options
    And it should educate about regenerative agriculture principles
    And Sarah's consumption should support ecological health
    And care economy should enable shift from extraction to regeneration
    And household consumption should contribute to ecosystem restoration
