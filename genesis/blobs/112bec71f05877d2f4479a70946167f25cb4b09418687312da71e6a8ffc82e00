Scenario: Alex maintains authority over their own body and treatment
    Given medical providers often assume they know what's best for disabled patients
    And Alex has deep expertise about their own body and disability
    When Alex interacts with medical providers
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex assert bodily autonomy
    And it should support Alex in refusing unwanted treatments
    And it should remind providers that Alex is expert on their own needs
    And medical decisions should remain under Alex's control
    And the protocol should structurally defend Alex's medical self-determination
    And informed consent should be meaningful, not coerced
    And Alex's authority over their own body should be absolute
