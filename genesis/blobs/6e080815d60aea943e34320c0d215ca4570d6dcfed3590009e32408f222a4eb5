Scenario: Coordinating household operations while navigating legal system
    Given I have family court hearings, protective order renewals, and legal appointments
    And household operations must continue despite legal demands
    When I manage competing priorities of legal navigation and household needs
    Then the Value Scanner coordinates across both domains
    And ensures children's needs don't fall through cracks during legal crisis
    And tracks legal deadlines without letting household management suffer
    And helps me prepare for legal events while maintaining household stability
    And my personal_agent balances urgent legal tasks with ongoing household care
    And surfaces support for children during particularly stressful legal periods
    And recognizes that managing both is extraordinary organizational labor
    And prevents either domain from overwhelming the other
