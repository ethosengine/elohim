Scenario: Grandparents' childcare contributions recognized and valued
    Given Sarah's parents provide regular childcare
    And they help with Tommy and Emma multiple times weekly
    When the family_elohim tracks grandparent care
    Then their contributions should be quantified and valued
    And they should accumulate care tokens for their labor
    And their work should be recognized as essential family support
    And grandparents should not be taken for granted
    And multigenerational care should be reciprocal, not extractive
    And the system should make grandparent labor visible and valued
