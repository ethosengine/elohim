Scenario: National media coverage of landmark appeal
    Given my appeal involves constitutional question of widespread public interest
    And National Constitutional Council ruling will affect millions
    When my case receives national media attention
    Then my privacy is protected (anonymized coverage if I choose)
    And Public education about constitutional governance happens through my case
    And Democratic discourse is enriched by constitutional deliberation
    And Citizens understand Elohim Protocol governance through real example
    And My appeal contributes to public constitutional literacy
    And Transparency serves democratic accountability without violating dignity
