Scenario: Peer reviewing other expert testimony for quality assurance
    Given multiple experts advise National Council
    And peer review prevents individual capture or error
    When I review fellow expert's testimony
    Then I assess: technical accuracy and completeness
    And I identify: bias or conflicts of interest
    And I check: if alternative interpretations exist
    And I verify: adherence to testimony guidelines
    And I provide: constructive critique
    And I accept: critique of my own testimony
    And peer review: maintains expertise quality and independence
