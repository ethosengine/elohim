Scenario: Pension board member evaluates investment strategy balancing returns and values
    Given pension fund considers divesting from fossil fuel investments
    And staff analysis emphasizes fiduciary duty and projected investment returns
    And some beneficiaries advocate for climate-conscious investing
    When the board member requests Observer independent analysis
    Then they receive comparison of fossil fuel versus clean energy investment performance
    And see examples from peer pension funds that divested with outcome data
    And access analysis of climate risk to long-term portfolio value
    And understand fiduciary duty in context of environmental and social factors
    And independent analysis helps board balance competing considerations
