Scenario: Identifying food waste reduction opportunities at neighborhood scale
    Given Marcus must maximize value from limited budget
    And food waste represents lost resources
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies waste patterns
    Then it should connect Marcus to gleaning opportunities
    And it should facilitate food rescue programs
    And it should help him access surplus food from stores
    And neighborhood coordination should reduce waste while addressing need
    And Marcus's family should benefit from systematic waste reduction
    And ecological and economic goals should align
