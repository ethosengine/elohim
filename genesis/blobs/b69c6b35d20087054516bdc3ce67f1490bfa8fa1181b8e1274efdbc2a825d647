Scenario: Understanding food systems complexity through shopping
    Given Marcus shops regularly and makes food choices
    And food connects to complex agricultural and distribution systems
    When Marcus scans food items
    Then the personal_agent should surface information about food origins
    And it should show where food comes from and who grows it
    And it should explain care labor embedded in food production
    And Marcus should learn that his choices connect to larger systems
    And food system awareness should develop through practice
    And ecological consciousness should build on care economy foundation
