Scenario: Sharing meal prep to reduce individual burden
    Given cooking for one is inefficient and exhausting
    When household members batch cook or share meals
    Then the protocol should coordinate shared meal preparation
    And track who cooks, who cleans, and who benefits
    And help us establish sustainable shared cooking rhythms
    And recognize this cooperation as care economy practice
