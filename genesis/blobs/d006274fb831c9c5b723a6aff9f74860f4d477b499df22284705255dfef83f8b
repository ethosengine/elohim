Scenario: Care for sibling recognized without enabling parentification
    Given Marcus cares for Keisha age 7
    And he manages her meals and nutritional needs
    When Marcus makes care decisions for Keisha
    Then his care work should be tracked by family_elohim
    And the system should recognize legitimate care contributions
    And it should also watch for parentification damage
    And Keisha should be prompted to appreciate Marcus's work
    And the protocol should prevent Keisha from taking Marcus for granted
    And family_elohim should help maintain sibling dynamics alongside care reality
    And Marcus should be supported, not exploited
