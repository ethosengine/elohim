Scenario: Analyzing Global Constitutional Convention deliberations
    Given 10,000 randomly-selected global citizens convene every 7 years
    And this is unprecedented experiment in planetary democracy
    When I study the Global Constitutional Convention process
    Then I examine: how citizens from radically different contexts deliberate together
    And I analyze: what enables agreement despite profound disagreement
    And I assess: quality of translation and cross-cultural understanding
    And I explore: how amendments emerge from global collective wisdom
    And I identify: power dynamics (Global North vs South, wealthy vs poor)
    And I investigate: whether global sortition can produce legitimate law
    And My research reveals: possibilities and limits of planetary democratic governance
