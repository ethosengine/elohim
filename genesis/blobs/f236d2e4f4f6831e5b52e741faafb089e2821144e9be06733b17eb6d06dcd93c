Scenario: Seasonal and local food availability at neighborhood level
    Given Marcus shops in specific geographic area
    And seasonal local food is often cheaper
    When Marcus plans meals
    Then the personal_agent should highlight seasonal local options
    And it should show what's available from neighborhood sources
    And it should help him find affordable local produce
    And neighborhood farmers' markets should be integrated
    And local food systems should benefit Marcus's budget
    And bioregional awareness should develop through practice
