Scenario: Nutritional science learned through responsibility for health
    Given Marcus is responsible for his and Keisha's nutrition
    And adequate nutrition requires scientific understanding
    When Marcus makes food choices
    Then he should be learning applied nutritional science
    And the personal_agent should teach nutrition in context
    And he should understand macronutrients, vitamins, balanced diet
    And learning should be motivated by real care responsibility
    And nutritional education should be deeper than typical age 12 curriculum
    And his care work should accelerate domain-specific learning
