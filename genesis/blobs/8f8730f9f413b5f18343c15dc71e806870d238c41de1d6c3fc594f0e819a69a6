Scenario: Alex's disability expertise recognized as valuable family knowledge
    Given Alex has deep expertise about disability, accessibility, and ableism
    And this knowledge benefits entire family
    When family engages with disability-related topics
    Then Alex should be recognized as the family expert
    And family should seek Alex's guidance on accessibility matters
    And Alex's advocacy work should be valued as contribution
    And Alex's perspective should shape family understanding
    And the family_elohim should position Alex as knowledge source
    And Alex's disability experience should be treated as expertise, not deficit
    And family should learn from Alex, not pity Alex
