Scenario: Customer experiences neighborhood economic resilience through democratic network
    Given corporate businesses close arbitrarily based on distant profit calculations
    And neighborhood institutions disappeared despite community need
    When democratic businesses are accountable to community not distant shareholders
    Then businesses remain open serving community even during economic downturns
    And worker ownership ensures commitment to neighborhood survival
    And democratic network provides mutual aid during crises
    And community economic resilience increases through democratic ownership
    And community_elohim coordinates network resilience strategies
