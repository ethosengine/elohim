Scenario: Repair and mending skills reduce waste
    Given Margaret knows how to repair clothing, household items, equipment
    And repair culture counters disposability
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks repair practices
    Then Margaret's mending and repair should be recognized
    And skills should be valued as ecological care contribution
    And repair knowledge should be shared with younger generations
    And community repair culture should be strengthened
    And disposability should be countered by repair practices
    And Margaret's skills should serve bioregional sustainability
