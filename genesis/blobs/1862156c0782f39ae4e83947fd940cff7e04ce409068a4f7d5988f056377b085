Scenario: Household resource sharing to extend budget
    Given Margaret's fixed income requires resource optimization
    And household expenses can be reduced through sharing
    When the household_elohim identifies sharing opportunities
    Then it should connect Margaret to tool libraries
    And it should facilitate bulk buying cooperatives
    And it should suggest neighborhood resource sharing
    And it should help reduce household costs through community
    And Margaret's budget should stretch further through cooperation
    And resource sharing should feel like community, not charity
