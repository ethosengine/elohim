Scenario: Supporting Maria's boundaries against impossible external demands
    Given everyone wants more from Maria—employers, schools, children, family, community
    And she has finite capacity with no partner to share load
    When external demands are placed on Maria
    Then the personal_agent should monitor her total commitments
    And it should help her evaluate what she can realistically handle
    And it should support her in saying no when necessary
    And it should remind her that she's already doing more than humanly sustainable
    And Maria should have AI support for boundary-setting
