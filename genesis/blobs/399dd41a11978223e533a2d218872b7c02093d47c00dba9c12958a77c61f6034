Scenario: Developer childcare commitment becomes enforceable
    Given a developer promised on-site childcare facility as community benefit
    And families counted on childcare when development was approved
    When the Observer tracks community benefit delivery
    Then monitoring shows: childcare space was never built
    And developer converted it to retail space increasing revenue
    And families who moved to development lack promised childcare
    And broken commitment affects working families' ability to afford housing
    And accountability creates real consequences for unkept promises
