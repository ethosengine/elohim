Scenario: Transparent community resource allocation based on care contributions
    Given community resources are limited
    And allocation decisions must be made
    When the community_elohim allocates resources
    Then allocation should be based on transparent care economy principles
    And care contributions should influence resource access
    And Marcus's substantial household labor should be weighted appropriately
    And the process should be visible and accountable
    And community members should understand allocation rationale
    And care economy should provide fair distribution framework
