Scenario: Property tax relief and housing support for fixed-income seniors
    Given Margaret lives on fixed income
    And property taxes or rent can threaten housing stability
    When the municipality_elohim identifies housing assistance
    Then senior property tax relief programs should be communicated
    And rental assistance should be accessible if applicable
    And Margaret should be able to age in place affordably
    And housing stability should be protected for seniors
    And municipal housing policy should recognize fixed-income constraints
    And aging in community should be economically feasible
