Scenario: Parent connects development pattern to school overcrowding
    Given the parent's child attends chronically overcrowded school
    And wonders why enrollment keeps increasing
    When the parent reviews Observer's municipal development history
    Then they see 5 major residential developments approved in 3 years
    And learn developers paid minimal school impact fees
    And understand city approved housing without ensuring school capacity
    And systematic pattern of municipal decisions harming education becomes visible
    And parent advocacy targets growth management policies
