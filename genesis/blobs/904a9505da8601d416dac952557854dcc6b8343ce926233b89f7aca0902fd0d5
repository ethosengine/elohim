Scenario: Teen coordinates care work across community contexts
    Given Jasmine works part-time, volunteers, and contributes to family
    And these contexts are all part of community care economy
    When the community_elohim aggregates her contributions
    Then all care work should be visible in integrated view
    And she should see how her contributions connect across contexts
    And understand that paid work, household labor, and volunteering are all care economy
    And develop sophisticated understanding of how care creates value in multiple forms
    And learn to manage complexity while maintaining coherent identity
    And see herself as participating in integrated community care economy
