Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Senior
  As a senior in early retirement (ages 65-74) in the value scanner system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want my personal autonomy, dignity, and care contributions to be recognized
  So that retirement is experienced as liberation for care work, not obsolescence

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the senior user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret is 68 years old, retired from nursing
    And Margaret lives on fixed income of $32k/year
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Margaret's personal_agent is configured for dignity preservation
    And the interface is optimized for accessibility needs

  Scenario: Accessible interface design respects aging-related needs
    Given Margaret is using the Value Scanner
    And she has age-related vision and dexterity changes
    When Margaret opens the scanner application
    Then the interface should display large, high-contrast fonts
    And touch targets should be large and forgiving
    And voice interface options should be available
    And navigation should be simple and consistent
    And no time-limited interactions should be required
    And the pace should be patient without being patronizing
    And the interface should feel respectful and empowering
    And cognitive load should be minimized

  Scenario: Managing fixed income with dignity and sophistication
    Given Margaret has a $150/week grocery budget
    And her income is fixed and cannot be increased through employment
    When Margaret plans her shopping
    Then her personal_agent should provide sophisticated budgeting tools
    And it should identify sales and optimize value per dollar
    And it should track spending across weeks for pattern analysis
    And it should suggest resource optimization without stigma
    And it should help her maintain quality of life within constraints
    And the framing should be dignity-preserving, not scarcity-shaming
    And Margaret should experience agency, not deprivation

  Scenario: Tracking changing nutritional needs for health management
    Given Margaret is managing early-stage diabetes
    And she needs more protein and calcium, less sodium
    And medications affect her appetite and digestion
    When Margaret shops for groceries
    Then her personal_agent should track nutrition across time
    And it should suggest foods appropriate for her health conditions
    And it should flag items high in sodium or sugar
    And it should highlight protein and calcium-rich options
    And it should help her balance health needs with budget constraints
    And nutritional guidance should feel supportive, not controlling
    And Margaret should maintain agency over food choices

  Scenario: Making retirement care contributions visible at individual level
    Given Margaret provides 15 hours/week grandchild care
    And she volunteers 10 hours/week in community
    And she provides 8 hours/week elder care for her mother
    When Margaret's care contributions are tracked
    Then her personal_agent should quantify all care labor
    And it should calculate market value (~$15k/year grandchild care)
    And it should accumulate care tokens for all contributions
    And it should make visible that she's highly productive
    And Margaret should experience herself as valuable contributor
    And the data should counter cultural narrative of retired as "not working"
    And her contributions should be recognized, not invisible

  Scenario: Personal agent serves Margaret's autonomy without infantilizing
    Given Margaret is a capable adult with decades of life experience
    And the interface uses AI assistance
    When the personal_agent interacts with Margaret
    Then it must preserve her full autonomy and dignity
    And it must never be patronizing or infantilizing
    And it must respect her expertise and judgment
    And it must provide information, not directives
    And it must acknowledge her nursing background and competence
    And the relationship should be respectful partnership
    And Margaret should feel empowered, never managed

  Scenario: Building care economy capital for future aging needs
    Given Margaret is watching her 92-year-old mother navigate advanced aging
    And Margaret recognizes her own future care needs
    When Margaret makes care contributions now
    Then care tokens should accumulate to her individual account
    And these tokens should represent future care economy resources
    And the system should help her build reciprocal relationships
    And she should be preparing for increased care needs in 10-20 years
    And current contributions should create future security
    And Margaret should experience agency in planning her own aging

  Scenario: Privacy control remains with Margaret as autonomous adult
    Given Margaret's care contribution data is being tracked
    And health information is particularly sensitive
    When Margaret determines data sharing preferences
    Then she must have complete control over all her data
    And she should choose what's shared with family, doctors, or community
    And she can demonstrate care value to family if she wishes
    And she can maintain complete privacy if she prefers
    And health data sharing must be explicitly consented
    And Margaret's autonomy over her information must be absolute

  Scenario: Medication interactions and dietary considerations tracked
    Given Margaret takes multiple medications
    And medications interact with certain foods
    When Margaret shops for groceries
    Then her personal_agent should be aware of medication interactions
    And it should flag potentially problematic food-drug combinations
    And it should suggest foods that support medication effectiveness
    And medication data should remain private and encrypted
    And the system should support her health management
    And Margaret should feel supported in complex health navigation

  Scenario: Reducing food waste with fixed income constraints
    Given Margaret's budget requires maximizing every dollar
    And food waste represents meaningful lost resources
    When Margaret plans meals and shopping
    Then her personal_agent should help minimize waste
    And it should suggest appropriate portion sizes for one or two people
    And it should track perishables and suggest usage timing
    And it should recommend preservation techniques Margaret knows from experience
    And waste reduction should align with both budget and values
    And Margaret's generation's knowledge of frugality should be honored

  Scenario: Maintaining independence through effective resource management
    Given Margaret values her independence
    And she wants to avoid becoming "a burden"
    When Margaret uses the Value Scanner over time
    Then it should help her maintain self-sufficiency
    And it should optimize her resources for maximum independence
    And it should connect her to community resources without stigma
    And it should make her care contributions visible
    And Margaret should experience continued agency and autonomy
    And the system should support her in aging on her own terms

  Scenario: Recognition of unpaid care labor builds self-worth
    Given Margaret's care contributions are substantial but unpaid
    And traditional economics labels her as "not working"
    When Margaret reviews her care contribution data
    Then she should see quantified value of her labor
    And she should understand her economic contribution is significant
    And she should experience herself as productive member of society
    And the narrative of retirement as obsolescence should be countered
    And Margaret should have data to assert her value
    And her dignity and self-worth should be affirmed

  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained throughout system
    Given Margaret participates in the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Margaret chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then her choice must be honored immediately
    And all data retention must follow minimal legal requirements
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
    And Margaret's right to not participate must be absolute
    And her autonomy over technology use must be respected
    And disconnection should be simple and complete
