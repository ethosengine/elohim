Scenario: Partner accountability for equitable labor sharing
    Given the household_elohim makes labor distribution visible
    And the partner can see he performs only 25% of household work
    When the partner commits to increasing his contribution
    Then the system should track whether he follows through
    And it should provide accountability for behavioral change
    And it should show whether labor distribution is actually improving
    And accountability should be built into the care economy system
    And moving toward equity should be trackable and measurable
    And the system should support partnership transformation
