Scenario: Family care burden monitoring prevents Margaret's burnout
    Given Margaret provides care across three generations
    And she has limited time and energy
    When the family_elohim monitors total care burden
    Then it should track cumulative care hours across all relationships
    And it should flag when burden becomes unsustainable
    And it should surface need for family conversation about distribution
    And Margaret's own needs should be protected
    And the system should prevent exploitation disguised as family care
    And burnout prevention should be built into family coordination
