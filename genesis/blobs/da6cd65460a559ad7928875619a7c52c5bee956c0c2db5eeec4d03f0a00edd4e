Scenario: Responding to constituent concerns about AI governance
    Given residents contact me about protocol experiences
    And I am accountable through elections
    When I maintain constituent engagement on AI governance
    Then I hold: town halls in communities like Riverside
    And I offer: office hours for people like Marcus to share experiences
    And I conduct: surveys gathering feedback on legislation
    And I respond: to concerns showing I'm listening
    And I maintain: constituent services for protocol-related issues
    And I remain: democratically accountable for policy choices
