Scenario: Workers collaborate with community organizations for mutual benefit
    Given local youth program needs employment opportunities
    And ChickenMax needs additional staff during busy periods
    When workers discuss partnership with youth program
    Then workers create paid internship program for neighborhood youth
    And workers provide mentorship and skill development
    And workers hire successful interns as permanent staff
    And community_elohim tracks youth development outcomes
    And community wealth circulates through youth employment
