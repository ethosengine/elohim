Scenario: Mentoring younger community members and leaders
    Given Margaret has professional experience and life wisdom
    And younger adults benefit from mentoring
    When the community_elohim facilitates mentoring connections
    Then Margaret should be connected to mentees
    And her knowledge should be passed to next generation
    And the mentoring labor should be tracked as care contribution
    And intergenerational knowledge transmission should be valued
    And Margaret's experience should serve community capacity-building
    And younger leaders should benefit from senior guidance
