Scenario: Workplace culture education reduces ableism
    Given workplace culture often reflects ableist assumptions
    And coworkers may lack disability awareness
    When the workplace_elohim detects cultural issues
    Then it should help Alex identify patterns of workplace ableism
    And it should provide Alex tools to educate coworkers when Alex chooses
    And it should support Alex in advocating for cultural change
    And workplace should be prompted toward disability inclusion training
    And Alex should be compensated if providing disability education
    And the protocol should recognize that cultural change is ongoing work
    And Alex should not bear sole responsibility for workplace education
