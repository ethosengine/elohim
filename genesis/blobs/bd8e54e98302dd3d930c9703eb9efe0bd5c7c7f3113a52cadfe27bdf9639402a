Scenario: Advocating for industry-wide living wage standards
    Given current food service wages are systematically too low to live on
    When workers organize for living wage campaigns
    Then the protocol should support industry-wide living wage advocacy
    And provide evidence of inadequate current wages
    And help workers coordinate collective demands
    And build movement for mandatory living wage in food service
