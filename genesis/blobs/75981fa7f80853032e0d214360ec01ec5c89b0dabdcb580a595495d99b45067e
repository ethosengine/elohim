Scenario: Accessing household support during crisis periods
    Given work demands sometimes become overwhelming
    When I am working double shifts or experiencing crisis
    Then the protocol should facilitate household mutual aid
    And help roommates understand my temporary extra needs
    And suggest how others can support me during difficult periods
    And enable reciprocity when my situation improves
