Scenario: Learning value literacy through concrete application
    Given abstract economic theory is less effective than practice
    And Aisha learns best through direct experience
    When Aisha uses the Value Scanner
    Then value education should happen through application
    And concepts should be taught in context of real decisions
    And theory should emerge from practice
    And learning should be concrete and immediately applicable
    And value literacy should develop through lived experience
    And education should be embodied, not abstract
