Scenario: Learning to recognize own needs and ask for help
    Given Kenji is navigating adult independence for first time
    And college culture often treats struggling as weakness
    When Kenji faces challenges beyond his current capacity
    Then the personal_agent should teach him to recognize when he needs help
    And it should normalize asking for support as strength, not failure
    And it should connect him to available resources (food bank, counseling, emergency aid)
    And the agent should validate that everyone needs help sometimes
    And the system should counteract toxic independence culture
    And Kenji should learn that care economy includes receiving care
