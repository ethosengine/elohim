Scenario: Emergency child pickup when Maria is stuck at work
    Given Maria's medical assistant job sometimes requires staying late unexpectedly
    And she has no co-parent to handle emergencies
    When Maria needs emergency child pickup from school or activities
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect her to nearby trusted neighbors
    And neighbors who can help should be identified quickly
    And emergency care should be available based on reciprocal care economy
    And Maria should have backup for inevitable work-parenting conflicts
    And neighborhood mutual aid should replace missing co-parent for emergencies
