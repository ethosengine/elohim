Scenario: Home maintenance coordinated with dignity preservation
    Given Helen can no longer manage all household tasks independently
    And she needs help with cleaning, repairs, and maintenance
    When the household_elohim coordinates support services
    Then Helen should remain the authority in her own home
    And support workers should be coordinated around her preferences
    And the household should feel like hers, not an institution
    And her choices about how things are done should be respected
    And assistance should enhance her ability to stay home
    And she should not feel like a guest in her own space
    And the protocol should preserve the dignity of "this is my home"
