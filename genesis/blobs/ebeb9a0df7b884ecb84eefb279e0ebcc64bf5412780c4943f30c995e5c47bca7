Scenario: Household care labor made visible despite reduced monetary income
    Given James's care work is worth $50k+/year professionally
    And household monetary income is only $40k/year
    When household economics are evaluated
    Then the household_elohim should show total household value
    And James's care labor should be valued alongside income
    And household should be recognized as generating $90k+ total value
    And care work should count as household economic contribution
    And reduced monetary income should not mean reduced household value
