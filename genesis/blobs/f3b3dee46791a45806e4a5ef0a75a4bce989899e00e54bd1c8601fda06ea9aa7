Scenario: Managing children's trauma responses and behavioral challenges
    Given my children are exhibiting trauma responses from abuse and instability
    And I am also traumatized and resource-depleted
    When challenging behaviors arise in household
    Then the Value Scanner helps me track patterns and triggers
    And surfaces trauma-informed parenting strategies
    And connects me to appropriate support services for children
    And validates that these challenges are normal responses to abnormal circumstances
    And helps me maintain patience and compassion despite stress
    And my personal_agent provides in-the-moment coaching when I'm struggling
    And documents my sophisticated trauma-responsive parenting
    And recognizes this emotional labor as substantial care contribution
