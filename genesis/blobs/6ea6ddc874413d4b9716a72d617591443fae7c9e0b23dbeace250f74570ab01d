Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces household costs
    Given many families have similar needs
    And resource sharing could reduce individual costs
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies sharing opportunities
    Then Marcus's family should be connected to sharing networks
    And bulk buying cooperatives should be suggested
    And tool libraries and resource sharing should be facilitated
    And neighborhood coordination should stretch Marcus's budget further
    And collective consumption should reduce individual scarcity
    And care economy should operate at neighborhood scale
