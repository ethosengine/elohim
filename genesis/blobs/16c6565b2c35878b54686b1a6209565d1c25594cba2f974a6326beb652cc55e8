Scenario: Customer discovers consumption as political act building community wealth
    Given corporate consumption felt powerless and alienating
    And Ms. Johnson didn't think her spending mattered politically
    When democratic business makes consumption politically meaningful
    Then her modest annual spending ($900) supports worker ownership and living wages
    And money circulates in community rather than extracting to distant shareholders
    And consumption choice builds democratic economy infrastructure
    And she understands individual actions aggregate into systemic transformation
    And community_elohim helps customers see collective impact of consumption choices
