Scenario: Household care economy visible to counter narrative of burden
    Given society often frames disabled people as burdens on households
    And Alex contributes substantial household labor
    When household care contributions are displayed
    Then Alex's management, coordination, and decision-making should be visible
    And the household_elohim should quantify Alex's cognitive and emotional labor
    And data should counter the narrative that Alex is dependent burden
    And Alex should see themselves as household contributor
    And visibility should shift cultural understanding of disability and contribution
    And the protocol should make Alex's care work undeniable
    And Alex should experience affirmation of their household value
