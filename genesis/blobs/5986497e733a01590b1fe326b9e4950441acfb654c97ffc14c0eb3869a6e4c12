Scenario: Household care coordination prevents caregiver burnout
    Given Helen's daughter provides substantial household support
    And family caregiving risks burnout
    When the household_elohim tracks care labor
    Then it should identify when daughter's burden is unsustainable
    And it should suggest respite care before crisis occurs
    And it should coordinate additional support sources
    And daughter's care work should be recognized and valued
    And care tokens should accumulate for her labor
    And the system should protect both Helen and her caregivers
    And sustainable care networks should be built proactively
