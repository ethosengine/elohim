Scenario: Municipal housing policy supports aging in place
    Given Frank wants to age in his community
    And housing costs are significant on fixed income
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates housing policy
    Then it should support policies enabling aging in place
    And affordable housing should serve retired residents on fixed income
    And Frank should not be displaced by rising housing costs
    And municipal policy should recognize his decades of community contribution
    And housing should be treated as right, not commodity
    And care economy contributions should inform housing access
