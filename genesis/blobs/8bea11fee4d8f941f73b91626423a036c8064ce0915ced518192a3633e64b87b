Scenario: Workers implement community meal program responding to local need
    Given Ms. Johnson mentions isolated seniors need meal program
    And community stakeholder meeting includes customer input
    When workers deliberate on community meal program proposal
    Then workers investigate partnership with senior center
    And workers analyze costs and benefits of subsidized meals
    And workers democratically vote to implement senior meal program
    And workers allocate funding from eliminated franchise fee savings
    And community_elohim facilitates connection with senior center
    And 340 community meals are served in first quarter
