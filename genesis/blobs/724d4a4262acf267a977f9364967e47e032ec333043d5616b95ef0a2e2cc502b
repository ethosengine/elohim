Scenario: Workplace advocacy coordinates with other caregiving employees
    Given Robert works with other employees managing care responsibilities
    And collective advocacy is more effective than individual negotiation
    And workplace care economy benefits all caregiving employees
    When workplace_elohim facilitates collective advocacy
    Then it should connect Robert with other caregiving employees
    And support formation of employee resource groups for caregivers
    And facilitate collective advocacy for care-friendly policies
    And build workplace power through caregiver solidarity
    And demonstrate that care economy includes collective action
    And create workplace transformation through organized advocacy
    And leverage numbers for policy change
