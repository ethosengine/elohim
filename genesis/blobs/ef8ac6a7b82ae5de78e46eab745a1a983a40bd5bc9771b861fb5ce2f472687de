Scenario: Environmental accessibility enables disabled people's participation
    Given natural spaces are often inaccessible to disabled people
    And inaccessibility excludes disabled people from environmental connection
    When ecological spaces and programs are designed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should advocate for environmental accessibility
    And trails, parks, gardens should be wheelchair accessible
    And sensory accommodations should be considered
    And Alex should be able to participate in environmental care work
    And exclusion from nature compounds disability injustice
    And the protocol should recognize that accessibility is environmental justice
    And disabled people's right to nature should be protected
