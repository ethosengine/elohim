Scenario: Teaching children that environmental care is care work
    Given Sarah wants Tommy and Emma to understand ecological stewardship
    And she's teaching them care economy principles
    When Sarah teaches environmental practices
    Then the ecological_elohim should recognize this as value literacy education
    And teaching ecological care should accumulate care tokens
    And children should learn that caring for environment is care work
    And the system should value environmental education as parenting labor
    And next generation should internalize ecological care as fundamental
    And Sarah's environmental teaching should be recognized and valued
