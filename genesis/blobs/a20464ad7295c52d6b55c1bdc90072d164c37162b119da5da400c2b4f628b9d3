Scenario: Parent discovers coalition for school bus safety
    Given the parent's child rides Route 17 with chronic delays
    And 13 other parents along Route 17 report the same safety concerns
    When the Observer detects the alignment pattern
    Then the parent receives opt-in coalition notification
    And can see aggregated data on delay patterns and incidents
    And can coordinate testimony with other affected parents
    And isolated frustration becomes documented collective concern
    And 14 coordinated parents change the transportation meeting outcome
