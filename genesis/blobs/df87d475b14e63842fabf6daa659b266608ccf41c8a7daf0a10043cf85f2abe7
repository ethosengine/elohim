Scenario: Workers transition from corporate extraction to democratic ownership progressively
    Given ChickenMax has just converted to EAE ownership
    And workers are learning democratic governance practices
    When workers hold their first month of democratic operations
    Then early decisions are worker-proposed, coordinator-advised, worker-approved
    And workers gradually take on more complex governance decisions
    And training is provided for business operations, bookkeeping, and strategy
    And workplace_elohim facilitates learning democratic skills
    And after 6 months, workers govern fully with coordinator in support role only
