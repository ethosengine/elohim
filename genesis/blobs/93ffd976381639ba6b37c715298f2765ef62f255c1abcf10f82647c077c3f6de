Scenario: Balancing technical expert advice with my human judgment
    Given Marcus's case involves complex pattern detection algorithms
    And I don't understand the technical details
    When technical expert Dr. Okonkwo explains the agent's reasoning
    Then she translates: cryptographic proofs into accessible language
    And she clarifies: what confidence levels mean and their limitations
    And she acknowledges: uncertainties and competing interpretations
    And she informs: but doesn't tell us what decision is right
    And I weigh: her technical knowledge alongside my human wisdom
    And I judge: whether constitutional principles were honored
    And I respect: expertise without surrendering my judgment authority
