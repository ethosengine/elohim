Scenario: Personal agent prevents burnout through proactive monitoring
    Given Sarah is at high risk for burnout
    And she tends to sacrifice herself unsustainably
    When her personal_agent detects warning signs
    Then it should watch for nutrition suffering, exercise disappearing, social connection eroding
    And it should proactively surface help options before crisis
    And it should connect Sarah to community support resources
    And it should recognize that her capacity to care depends on her well-being
    And intervention should be timely, dignified, and effective
