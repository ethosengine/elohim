Scenario: Exercising the right to change my mind and try different approaches
    Given I am trying various strategies for rebuilding stability
    And some approaches work better than others
    When I decide to change direction or try something new
    Then the Value Scanner supports my experimentation without judgment
    And does not penalize me for changing course
    And helps me learn from what didn't work
    And validates that finding the right path takes trial and error
    And institutional partners respect my right to redirect
    And my personal_agent helps me evaluate different approaches
    And tracks what I've learned, not just what "failed"
    And my agency to pivot is preserved and supported
