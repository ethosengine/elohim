Scenario: Sharing life learning with family
    Given Kenji is developing new knowledge and capabilities
    And his learning could benefit family members
    When Kenji shares environmental science knowledge with family
    Then the family_elohim should recognize teaching family as care contribution
    And it should value knowledge transfer from student to parents
    And it should recognize reverse mentoring (young teaching old) as valid
    And Kenji's education should benefit whole family, not just himself
    And the system should value educational contributions to family
    And students should be recognized as bringing new knowledge to family
