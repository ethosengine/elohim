Scenario: Planning commissioner discovers voting pattern aligned with developer interests
    Given commissioner has served for two years making numerous land use decisions
    And local newspaper questions commissioner's independence
    And commissioner wants to understand their own voting record

    Then they see their votes on developments categorized by community support levels
    And discover they voted for 85% of projects opposed by neighborhood associations
    And find their votes consistently favor developments with higher density than staff recommended
    And access campaign contribution data showing developer funding sources
    And accountability transparency helps commissioner reflect on whose interests they serve
