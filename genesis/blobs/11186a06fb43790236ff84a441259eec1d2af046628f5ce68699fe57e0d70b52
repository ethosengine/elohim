Scenario: Documenting community-specific calibration process
    Given Riverside calibrated privacy thresholds higher than protocol default
    And this reflected community values and history
    When I document how community calibration happened
    Then I capture: deliberation process that led to calibration decision
    And I analyze: how community exercised sovereignty within constitutional bounds
    And I examine: role of community leader in facilitating values discussion
    And I track: whether calibration actually served community better
    And I study: how local diversity strengthens rather than fragments protocol
    And My research demonstrates: subsidiarity in practice
    And Findings support: community autonomy as democratic AI principle
