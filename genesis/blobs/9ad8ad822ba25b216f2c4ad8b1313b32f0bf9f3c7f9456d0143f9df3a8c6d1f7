Scenario: Transition from family household to independent household
    Given Aisha recently moved out of her family home
    And she's adapting to independent household management
    When Aisha establishes her household practices
    Then the system should recognize this is a major transition
    And it should help her adapt family practices to solo living
    And it should provide continuity from family care economy patterns
    And the personal_agent should acknowledge the learning curve
    And support should smooth the jarring transition to full responsibility
