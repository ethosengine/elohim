Scenario: Advocating for worker ownership and cooperative models
    Given current ownership structures extract from workers
    When workers want to explore alternative ownership models
    Then the protocol should provide information about worker cooperatives
    And connect workers interested in cooperative organizing
    And support transition toward worker ownership in food service
    And build examples of care-economy-aligned food business models
