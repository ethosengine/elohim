Scenario: Educational policy shaped by teacher care work advocacy
    Given Sarah has deep knowledge of educational needs from professional experience
    And education policy affects her capacity to care for students
    When educational policy decisions are made
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her voice
    And teacher advocacy should be strengthened by care economy data
    And policy should reflect actual educator experiences
    And care economy should empower teacher voice in education governance
    And those who do care work should shape care work policy
