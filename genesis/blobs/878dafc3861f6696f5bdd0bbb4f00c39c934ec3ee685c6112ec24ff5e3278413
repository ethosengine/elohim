Scenario: Developer receives honest job creation analysis
    Given a developer claims project will "create 200 jobs"
    And uses job creation to justify public subsidies
    When the Observer provides independent employment impact analysis
    Then the developer sees: 180 jobs are temporary construction jobs
    And only 20 are permanent positions
    And median permanent job wage is $15/hour in area with $22/hour living wage
    And honest accounting distinguishes temporary versus permanent employment
    And job quality matters as much as job quantity
