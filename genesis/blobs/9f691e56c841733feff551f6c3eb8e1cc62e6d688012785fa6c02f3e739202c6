Scenario: Bioregional connection through local food and resources
    Given Sarah's family lives in specific bioregion
    And connecting to local ecology builds stewardship
    When the ecological_elohim supports bioregional connection
    Then it should help Sarah source local food and resources
    And it should provide information about regional ecology
    And it should recognize Sarah's work to build local connections
    And bioregional care should be valued in care economy
    And the system should support regional ecological engagement
    And Sarah should be rewarded for choosing local over global
