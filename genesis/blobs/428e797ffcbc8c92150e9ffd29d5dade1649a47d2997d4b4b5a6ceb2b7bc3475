Scenario: Recognizing educational institution care economy failures
    Given Kenji's college charges high tuition while many students face food insecurity
    And educational institutions can exploit student labor
    When the educational_elohim helps Kenji analyze institutional practices
    Then it should teach him to recognize extractive vs. care-based institutions
    And it should help him see when colleges fail care economy principles
    And it should validate his critique of exploitative educational models
    And the system should build critical awareness of institutional care failures
    And Kenji should learn to evaluate institutions through care economy lens
    And educational institutions should be accountable to care economy standards
