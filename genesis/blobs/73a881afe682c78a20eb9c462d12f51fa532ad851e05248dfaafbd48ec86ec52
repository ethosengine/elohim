Scenario: Participating in global protocol security threat assessment
    Given authoritarian regimes and corporations might attack protocol
    And global security coordination is needed
    When I work with international expert network on threat assessment
    Then we identify: attack vectors across different contexts
    And we share: vulnerability information securely
    And we coordinate: defense mechanisms globally
    And we avoid: creating centralized attack surface
    And we enable: resilience through distributed architecture
    And we serve: democratic governance security worldwide
    And we demonstrate: global technical cooperation
