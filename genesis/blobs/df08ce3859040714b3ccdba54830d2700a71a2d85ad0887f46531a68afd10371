Scenario: Board member tracks implementation of equity-focused discipline policy
    Given board adopted restorative justice policy to reduce suspensions two years ago
    And superintendent reported successful implementation at board meetings
    And community members report ongoing disparate discipline of students of color
    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking
    Then they see suspension rates by school, race, and disability status over time
    And discover overall suspensions declined but disparities remained or widened
    And find some schools implemented restorative practices while others didn't
    And access teacher training data showing incomplete implementation
    And impact tracking reveals gap between board policy and actual outcomes
