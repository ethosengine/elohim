Scenario: Opposing trade agreements compromising protocol sovereignty
    Given trade negotiations may include digital governance provisions
    And some proposals would restrict community autonomy
    When I evaluate trade agreement implications
    Then I identify: provisions threatening protocol sovereignty
    And I oppose: requirements mandating centralization or backdoors
    And I insist: on preserving community choice
    And I coalition: with other nations defending autonomy
    And I use: evidence showing protocol benefits economic wellbeing
    And I resist: regulatory arbitrage through trade agreements
    And I protect: democratic governance from corporate capture via trade
