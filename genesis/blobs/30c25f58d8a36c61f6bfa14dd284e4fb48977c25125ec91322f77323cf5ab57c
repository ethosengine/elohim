Scenario: Connection to land through understanding food origins
    Given Marcus eats food grown in soil by farmers
    And connection to land is part of ecological literacy
    When Marcus learns about his food sources
    Then the personal_agent should teach bioregional geography
    And it should help him understand local agricultural landscape
    And it should build relationship between Marcus and the land feeding him
    And he should develop sense of place and bioregional identity
    And care economy should include care for ecological systems
    And stewardship should extend beyond human relationships
