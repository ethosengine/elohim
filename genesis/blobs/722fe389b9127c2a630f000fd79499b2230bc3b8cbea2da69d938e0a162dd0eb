    Given David participated in household decisions before diagnosis
    And his decision-making capability is now declining

    Then it should recognize David's changing capacity sensitively
    And it should adjust his governance role appropriately
    And it should preserve David's dignity despite declining capability
    And it should support James in taking on decisions David once made
    And governance transition should be respectful and gradual
    And David should maintain maximum autonomy possible
