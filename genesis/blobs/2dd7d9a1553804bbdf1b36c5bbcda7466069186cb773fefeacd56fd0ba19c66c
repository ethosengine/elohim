Scenario: Democratic food system becomes recognized industry sector alternative
    Given food industry is dominated by corporate extraction model
    And alternative models are marginalized as niche or idealistic
    When democratic food network reaches scale and proves viability
    Then "democratic food system" becomes recognized industry category
    And industry conferences, publications, and research treat it as serious alternative
    And investment flows toward democratic food enterprises
    And policy makers design regulations supporting democratic food system
    And industry_sector_elohim advocates for democratic food system recognition and support
