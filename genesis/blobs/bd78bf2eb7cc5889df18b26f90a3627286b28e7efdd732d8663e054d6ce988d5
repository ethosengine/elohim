Scenario: Maintaining hope for children's thriving despite single-parent family structure
    Given society often assumes single-parent families are inherently deficient
    And Maria worries about impact of solo parenting on her children
    When the family_elohim assesses family well-being
    Then it should recognize that children can thrive in single-parent families
    And it should validate Maria's parenting rather than reinforcing deficit narratives
    And it should help her see her children's actual thriving, not societal stereotypes
    And it should remind her that she is enough for her children
    And Maria should feel empowered as parent, not defined by family structure stigma
