Scenario: Municipal care economy data informs retirement policy
    Given Frank's care contributions are tracked through Value Scanner
    And municipal data reveals aggregate retired resident contributions
    When the municipal_elohim analyzes retirement care economy
    Then it should quantify total volunteer labor from retired residents
    And calculate market value of unpaid care work (~millions annually)
    And surface that retired residents provide massive municipal value
    And inform policy recognizing caregiving in benefit calculations
    And demonstrate that retirement is transition to care work, not exit from contribution
    And support municipal policy that values and supports retired residents
