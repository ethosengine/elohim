Scenario: Shifting from dependent to junior contributor role
    Given Emma has increasing capability at age 8
    And her family role is evolving
    When Emma makes care contributions through the scanner
    Then she should be recognized as junior contributor, not just helper
    And her voice in family decisions should carry real weight
    And the family_elohim should track her growing capability
    And Sarah should be supported in granting appropriate autonomy
    And Emma should experience increasing responsibility
    And family dynamics should reflect her developmental transition
