Scenario: Successful conversion demonstrates viability to municipal economic development officials
    Given city economic development typically subsidizes corporate expansion
    And officials are skeptical of alternative ownership models
    When Rosa's conversion proves successful with documented outcomes
    Then municipality sees concrete evidence: workers earning living wages without subsidies
    And job quality improves (higher wages, benefits, ownership) without tax breaks
    And community institution is preserved, not destroyed by corporate acquisition
    And municipal economic development data shows democratic ownership creates better outcomes
    And municipality_elohim provides officials with impact documentation
