Scenario: Advising on ecological standing amendment technical implications
    Given delegates consider granting ecosystems constitutional personhood
    And technical implementation is uncertain
    When I explain how agents would implement ecological standing
    Then I clarify: how ecosystem "voice" would be technically represented
    And I explore: methods for translating ecological data into constitutional claims
    And I assess: challenges in balancing human and ecological rights
    And I present: what's technically possible vs what requires research
    And I avoid: either dismissing as impossible or ignoring challenges
    And I enable: delegates to choose values given technical reality
    And I serve: constitutional innovation with technical honesty
