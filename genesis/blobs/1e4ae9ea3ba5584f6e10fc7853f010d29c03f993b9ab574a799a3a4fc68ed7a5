Scenario: Creating new household norms and governance after leaving abuse
    Given my household previously operated under abusive dynamics
    And I am rebuilding household culture based on safety and respect
    When I establish new household rules and norms
    Then the Value Scanner supports my authority as household decision-maker
    And helps me create age-appropriate structures for children
    And documents household agreements and expectations
    And tracks what's working and what needs adjustment
    And provides resources on healthy household dynamics
    And my personal_agent reminds household members of established norms
    And validates that rebuilding takes time and iteration
    And recognizes my household governance work as valuable labor
