Scenario: Municipal services accessibility for aging residents
    Given Frank is aging and may have mobility or transportation limitations
    And municipal services should remain accessible to all residents
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates service accessibility
    Then it should ensure public buildings are physically accessible
    And public transit should serve aging residents' mobility needs
    And municipal services should be available in formats accessible to aging users
    And digital services should accommodate aging-related changes
    And Frank should access municipal services with dignity
    And universal design should serve residents across lifespan
