Scenario: Privacy and autonomy as emerging independent adult
    Given Kenji is establishing adult independence
    And he has full rights to privacy in his personal life
    When care economy data is collected about Kenji
    Then he must have complete control over all personal information
    And no data should be shared with family or school without his consent
    And his adult autonomy should be respected completely
    And privacy should be default, not something he must request
    And the system should support his development of adult boundaries
    And Kenji's data sovereignty should be absolute
