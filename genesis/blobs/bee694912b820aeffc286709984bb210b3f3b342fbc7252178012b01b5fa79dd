Scenario: Multi-family appeal about shared resources
    Given multiple families share community resources
    And Family Elohim decisions affect resource distribution across families
    When we collectively appeal an allocation we believe is unjust
    Then the appeal bridges family layer to community layer governance
    And The Constitutional Council evaluates inter-family equity
    And They consider if resource distribution follows constitutional minimums
    And They examine if families had meaningful participation in allocation process
    And The appeal can trigger community deliberation on sharing principles
    And Multi-family coordination patterns emerge through appeal precedents
