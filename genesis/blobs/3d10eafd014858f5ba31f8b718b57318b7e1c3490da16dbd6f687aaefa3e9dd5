Scenario: Developer environmental compliance becomes state accountability issue
    Given a developer's projects consistently violate state environmental standards
    But receives minimal enforcement from state regulators
    When the Observer documents violation patterns and regulatory response
    Then analysis shows: 67 violations across 8 projects over 5 years
    And penalties total $180K while profits exceed $40M
    And state regulators approve new permits despite violation history
    And regulatory capture becomes statistically undeniable
    And developer faces pressure for genuine environmental compliance
