Scenario: Recognition of care contributions across multiple life contexts
    Given Jasmine contributes care work in multiple domains
    And she works 15 hours/week at her part-time job
    And she does substantial household labor
    And she volunteers 4 hours/week at community center
    When her personal_agent aggregates her care contributions
    Then all contexts should be recognized: household, paid work, volunteering, civic engagement
    And care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions
    And her work should be made visible as genuine economic participation
    And she should see herself as a productive member of society
    And her care contributions should give her standing in care economy discussions
