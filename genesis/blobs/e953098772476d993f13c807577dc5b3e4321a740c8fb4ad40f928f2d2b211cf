Scenario: Participating in global public education through convention
    Given convention proceedings are globally broadcast and accessible
    And billions of people watch our deliberations
    When I participate in constitutional debate
    Then public sees: ordinary citizens grappling with profound questions
    And they witness: democratic deliberation across radical diversity
    And they learn: about constitutional governance of AI
    And they understand: sortition democracy in action
    And they feel: connected to global democratic project
    And my participation: educates humanity about self-governance
    And I demonstrate: that democracy is not just for elites
