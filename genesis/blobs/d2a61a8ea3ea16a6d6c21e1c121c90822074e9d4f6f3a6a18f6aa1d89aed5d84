Scenario: Coordinating care for aging parents across distance
    Given Sarah's parents are in their 60s
    And they live in a different location
    And they're beginning to need support
    When Sarah provides care to her parents
    Then the family_elohim should track care contributions across distance
    And it should coordinate with siblings if present
    And it should help Sarah balance care for parents with care for children
    And elder care should be recognized as substantial care work
    And Sarah should not be overwhelmed by competing family demands
