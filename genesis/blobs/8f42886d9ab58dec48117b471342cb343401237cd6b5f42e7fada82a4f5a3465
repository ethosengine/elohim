Scenario: Teaching repair and maintenance reduces waste and consumption
    Given Frank knows how to repair buildings, equipment, and systems
    And repair culture counters disposability and resource extraction
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates repair knowledge sharing
    Then it should facilitate Frank teaching repair skills
    And help community members learn to maintain their homes
    And recognize repair education as ecological care contribution
    And reduce consumption through extended equipment lifespan
    And build bioregional self-sufficiency through skill transmission
    And Frank's knowledge should serve waste reduction and resilience
