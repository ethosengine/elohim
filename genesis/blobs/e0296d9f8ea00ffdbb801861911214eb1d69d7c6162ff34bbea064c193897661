Scenario: Activist fights harmful discipline policies
    Given suspension and expulsion rates seem racially disparate
    And the activist advocates for restorative justice
    When the Observer tracks discipline outcomes by race
    Then the activist shows Black students suspended at 3x rate
    And for same behaviors as white students who receive warnings
    And zero-tolerance policies fuel school-to-prison pipeline
    And presents evidence-based alternatives from other districts
    And policy reform campaign gains statistical backbone
