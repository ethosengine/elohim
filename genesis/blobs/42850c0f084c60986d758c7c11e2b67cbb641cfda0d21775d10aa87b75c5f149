Scenario: Deliberating fundamental constitutional tension
    Given an appeal reveals tension between care and privacy at constitutional level
    And regional councils have reached conflicting interpretations
    When we deliberate on national constitutional question
    Then we ask: "Does mental health intervention ever justify privacy breach constitutionally?"
    And we examine: not just case application but principle itself
    And we consider: implications for millions of future cases
    And we consult: technical experts, researchers, community leaders
    And we deliberate: over multiple sessions spanning weeks
    And we craft: comprehensive opinion with deep reasoning
    And we create: national precedent guiding all lower councils
    And we shape: constitutional understanding for generation
