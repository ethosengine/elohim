Scenario: Worker experiences liberation from constant surveillance anxiety
    Given Maria previously worked under corporate cameras monitoring for "time theft"
    And she developed stress from constant surveillance
    When the workplace converts to democratic ownership
    And cameras become worker-controlled witness infrastructure
    Then Maria no longer fears being watched for compliance
    And she experiences reduced workplace anxiety and stress
    And her health indicators improve (lower blood pressure, better sleep)
    And her sense of dignity and autonomy increases measurably
