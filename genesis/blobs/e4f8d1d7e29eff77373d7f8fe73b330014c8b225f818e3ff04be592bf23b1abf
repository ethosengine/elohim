Scenario: Tracking nutritional needs across family members
    Given Marcus is responsible for feeding himself and Keisha
    And Keisha has specific dietary needs and preferences
    When Marcus plans meals and shops
    Then the personal_agent should track both their nutritional requirements
    And it should alert Marcus to Keisha's needs: "Keisha needs more iron this week"
    And it should help him find affordable foods that meet her requirements
    And age-appropriate nutrition for both should be maintained
    And Marcus should have tools to ensure Keisha's healthy development
    And nutritional tracking should prevent inadequate diet
