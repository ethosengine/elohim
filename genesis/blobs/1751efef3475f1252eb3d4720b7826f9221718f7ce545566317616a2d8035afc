Scenario: Planning commissioner tracks developer's environmental commitments from past project
    Given same developer seeking approval for new project
    And past project approved with environmental mitigation commitments
    And commissioner wants to know if developer followed through on previous promises
    When the commissioner uses Observer implementation tracking
    Then they see developer's past project mitigation commitments versus implementation
    And discover tree planting and habitat restoration commitments not fully delivered
    And find stormwater management systems performing below promised levels
    And access documentation showing enforcement gaps by municipality
    And impact tracking reveals developer's track record diverged from promises
