Scenario: Recognition of substantial care labor as economically valuable
    Given Marcus performs household management work
    And similar work by adults would be compensated
    When Marcus completes weekly shopping and meal planning
    Then his care contributions should be valued at realistic economic rates
    And care tokens should reflect genuine value of his work
    And the system should make explicit that his labor is valuable
    And recognition should communicate that he's doing skilled work
    And his contributions should qualify family for community resources
    And his stewardship should be evidence of capability, not exploitation
