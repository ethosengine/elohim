Scenario: Developer faces accountability for past broken promises
    Given a developer claimed "200 jobs" in previous project
    But Observer tracking shows only 12 permanent jobs materialized
    When the developer proposes new project with similar claims
    Then planning commission sees documented gap between promises and delivery
    And community members access track record evidence
    And developer must explain past failures or adjust projections
    And accountability creates pressure for honest projections
    And extractive practices face uncomfortable transparency
