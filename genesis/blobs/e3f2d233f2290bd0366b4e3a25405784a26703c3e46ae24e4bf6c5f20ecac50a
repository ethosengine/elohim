Scenario: Accessing workplace benefits and resources for family stability
    Given employment may provide benefits (health insurance, paid leave, retirement) critical for stability
    And I need to maximize workplace benefits for family wellbeing
    When I evaluate or access workplace benefits
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me understand and maximize available benefits
    And guides enrollment in health insurance, retirement, other benefits
    And identifies workplace resources (EAP, childcare support, emergency assistance)
    And validates that benefits are part of compensation, not "extras"
    And helps me advocate for benefits if employer is unclear about offerings
    And my personal_agent tracks benefit enrollment deadlines and requirements
    And recognizes that benefits navigation is complex invisible labor
    And ensures I access all benefits supporting family stability
