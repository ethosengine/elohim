Scenario: Teacher informs early literacy policy with classroom expertise
    Given state mandates specific reading instruction approach
    And approach contradicts teacher professional knowledge and research
    When teachers document reading instruction reality through Observer
    Then teachers show mandated approach doesn't work for all students
    And provide evidence on effective literacy practices for diverse learners
    And document student reading outcomes under different approaches
    And coordinate with literacy researchers and reading specialists
    And reading policy becomes informed by professional expertise not ideology
