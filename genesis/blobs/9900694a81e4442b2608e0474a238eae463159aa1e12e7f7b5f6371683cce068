Scenario: Journalist detects pollution pattern across watershed
    Given the journalist investigates water quality concerns
    And pollution affects communities across watershed
    When the Observer tracks environmental data across jurisdictions
    Then the journalist sees contamination pattern from industrial facility upstream
    And maps affected communities downstream across state lines
    And documents regulatory agencies failing to coordinate enforcement
    And shows company violated permits in multiple states
    And publishes regional investigation forcing coordinated response
