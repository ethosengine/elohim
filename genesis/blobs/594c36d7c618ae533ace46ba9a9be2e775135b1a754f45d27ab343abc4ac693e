Scenario: Neighborhood care contributions visible across households
    Given Sarah contributes to neighborhood care economy
    And neighbors also contribute in various ways
    When neighborhood care patterns are tracked
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should make contributions visible
    And it should show who's contributing what
    And it should identify imbalances in participation
    And it should prompt recognition of neighbors' care work
    And visibility should enable fair neighborhood participation
