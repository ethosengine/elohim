Feature: Community Organizing for Activist
  As an activist in the social_medium system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to organize local action and build community power
  So that communities can address local issues through collective action

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active
    And the activist has established trust within their local community

  Scenario: Activist creates community organizing space
    Given the activist wants to address local housing affordability
    When they create a housing justice organizing space
    And they invite community members through trusted connections
    And they establish space charter emphasizing transparency and consensus
    Then the organizing space is created at community layer
    And invitations travel through web of trust
    And the space has tools for decision-making and coordination
    And community members can contribute safely within the space
    And the moderation agent helps maintain healthy dialogue

  Scenario: Activist shares evidence-based call to action
    Given the activist has researched city council voting records on housing
    And they have compiled data showing repeated votes against affordability
    When they create a contribution calling for community action
    And they attach verified sources and documentation
    And they propose attending the next city council meeting
    Then the system evaluates the evidence quality
    And the contribution reaches all organizing space members immediately
    And it reaches wider community with evidence-based reach boost
    And community members can endorse the call to action
    And coordination tools help organize attendance and testimony

  Scenario: Activist builds coalition across neighborhood boundaries
    Given multiple neighborhoods face similar housing challenges
    And the activist has credibility in their own neighborhood
    When they reach out to activists in adjacent neighborhoods
    And they propose forming a district-level coalition
    Then cross-neighborhood connections are negotiated through mutual trust
    And a district-layer organizing space is created
    And patterns from successful housing campaigns surface as resources
    And the coalition coordinates action while respecting local autonomy
    And each neighborhood maintains its own decision-making process

  Scenario: Activist prevents infiltration attempt
    Given the housing justice space has 50 active community members
    When a new member joins and immediately tries to promote violent tactics
    And they create multiple inflammatory contributions
    Then the earned reach system prevents wide distribution
    And the community_moderator is alerted to potential infiltration
    And existing members see community trust analysis
    And the space can collectively decide on appropriate response
    And the protection agent documents the incident for pattern recognition
    And organizing continues safely without disruption
