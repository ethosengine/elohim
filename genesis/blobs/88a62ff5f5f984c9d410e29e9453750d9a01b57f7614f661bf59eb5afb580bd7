Scenario: Ruling against agent decision when constitutional bounds exceeded
    Given I am reviewing an appeal where agent clearly overstepped
    And the facts show the decision violated constitutional principles
    When our council rules the agent decision unconstitutional
    Then the decision is: immediately overturned
    And appellant's preferences are: automatically restored
    And the incident is: documented as error in agent's record
    And similar interventions: require higher thresholds going forward
    And protocol improvements are: proposed and implemented
    And agent learns: from legitimate critique without being punished
    And accountability works: without compromising agent autonomy
