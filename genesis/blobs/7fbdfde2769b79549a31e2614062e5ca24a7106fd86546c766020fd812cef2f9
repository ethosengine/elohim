Scenario: Coordinating household care labor in retirement
    Given Frank and his wife both have time freedom from employment
    And household labor needs to be distributed equitably
    And traditional gender patterns may persist despite retirement
    When the household_elohim monitors labor distribution
    Then it should track household tasks performed by each partner
    And it should identify unfair distributions early
    And it should surface imbalances: "Frank's wife handles 75% of meal preparation"
    And both partners should receive prompts about equity
    And adjustments should be negotiated from data, not resentment
    And retirement should enable more equitable household partnerships
