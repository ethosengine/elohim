# Economic Events: Where Value Becomes Visible

## What is an Economic Event?

An Economic Event in hREA is an **observed economic flow** - something that actually happened, involving resources moving between agents.

Unlike intents (what might happen) or commitments (what will happen), events are **facts** - recorded observations of value creation.

## Event Anatomy

Every economic event records:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `action` | The verb: produce, consume, transfer, use, work, cite |
| `provider` | The agent giving the resource |
| `receiver` | The agent receiving the resource |
| `resourceQuantity` | How much of what |
| `effortQuantity` | Labor involved (for work actions) |
| `hasPointInTime` | When it happened |

## Actions: The Verbs of Value

hREA defines standard actions:

- **produce**: Create a new resource
- **consume**: Use up a resource
- **use**: Apply a resource without consuming it
- **work**: Apply effort/labor
- **transfer**: Move resource between agents
- **cite**: Reference another's work
- **modify**: Transform a resource

## Care Work as Economic Events

A caregiver's day creates many events:

```json
{
  "action": "work",
  "provider": "parent_maria",
  "receiver": "family_household",
  "effortQuantity": { "value": 3, "unit": "hours" },
  "note": "Meal preparation, homework help, emotional support",
  "resourceClassifiedAs": ["care-work", "household-labor"]
}
```

In traditional accounting, this is invisible.
In REA accounting, this is a recorded economic event.

## Track and Trace

Events connect into flows:
- `previous`: What events led to this one
- `next`: What events follow from this one
- `track`: Follow resources forward
- `trace`: Follow resources backward

This creates **value chain visibility** - seeing how care and creation flow through communities.
