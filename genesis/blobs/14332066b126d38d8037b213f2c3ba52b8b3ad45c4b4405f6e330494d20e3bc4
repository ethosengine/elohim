Scenario: Student mutual aid networks as care economy foundation
    Given Kenji participates in student mutual aid group
    And students share resources, knowledge, and support
    When the community_elohim tracks mutual aid participation
    Then it should recognize meal sharing as care contribution
    And it should value textbook lending, note sharing, and skill exchange
    And it should accumulate care tokens for helping other students
    And mutual aid should be understood as care economy practice
    And the system should make reciprocal support visible
    And student mutual aid should be recognized as community building
