Scenario: Developer lobbying relationships become transparent
    Given a developer lobbies state legislature for favorable policy
    And makes campaign donations to key committee members
    When the Observer tracks lobbying and political relationships
    Then constituents see: $250K in donations to housing committee members
    And identify correlation between donations and votes on developer-friendly bills
    And the developer faces accountability for political influence
    And legislators face scrutiny about who they serve
    And transparent relationships create pressure for merit-based policy
