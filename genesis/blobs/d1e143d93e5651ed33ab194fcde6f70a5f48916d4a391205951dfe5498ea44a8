Scenario: Mental health and emotional support in student community
    Given students face high stress, anxiety, and mental health challenges
    And formal mental health services are often inadequate
    When students provide emotional support to peers
    Then the community_elohim should recognize emotional labor as care work
    And it should value listening, validating, and supporting peers in crisis
    And it should accumulate care tokens for emotional care work
    And mental health support should be understood as community care
    And the system should validate peer emotional support as real work
    And student community should be recognized as mental health resource
