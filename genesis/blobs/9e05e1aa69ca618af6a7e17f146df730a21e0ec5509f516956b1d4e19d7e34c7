Scenario: Accessible interface respects aging-related needs without patronizing
    Given Frank is experiencing some age-related vision changes
    And he may have reduced dexterity for small touch targets
    When Frank uses the Value Scanner interface
    Then the interface should display large, high-contrast fonts
    And touch targets should be large and forgiving
    And voice interface options should be available
    And navigation should be simple and consistent
    And no time-limited interactions should be required
    And the design should be accessible without feeling condescending
    And Frank should experience the interface as respectful and empowering
    And cognitive load should be minimized
