Scenario: Organizer creates accessible materials on school funding formula
    Given parents don't understand why their school has fewer resources
    And school funding formula is complex and opaque
    When the organizer requests education materials from Observer
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of funding sources
    And see visual comparison of per-pupil spending across schools
    And get breakdown of how formula creates inequities
    And access talking points for advocating for funding changes
    And technical education finance becomes accessible community knowledge
