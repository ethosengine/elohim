Scenario: Family care token allocation includes young child contributions
    Given the family participates in care token economy
    And Tommy has made multiple care contributions
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Tommy's contributions should be valued appropriately
    And his care work should not be dismissed as "just helping"
    And tokens should accumulate to the family account
    And Tommy should have age-appropriate awareness of his contributions
    And the family should receive care token supplements for low income
    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status
