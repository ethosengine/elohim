Scenario: Household resource allocation based on visible contributions
    Given Sarah and partner make joint financial decisions
    And both contribute care labor to household
    When household resources are allocated
    Then the household_elohim should present both partners' contributions
    And care labor should be valued alongside paid employment
    And Sarah's unpaid care work should carry equal weight to partner's income
    And resource decisions should reflect all contributions, not just money
    And household economics should recognize care creates value
