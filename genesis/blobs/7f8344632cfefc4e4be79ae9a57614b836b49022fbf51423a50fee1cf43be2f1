Scenario: Personal burnout risk detection and intervention
    Given Sarah has been operating at unsustainable intensity
    And she wakes at 5:30am and works until 10pm daily
    When the personal_agent detects burnout patterns
    Then it should flag the unsustainability explicitly
    And it should say "This pace will break you. You need support."
    And it should connect her to respite resources
    And it should help her identify what must give
    And crisis intervention should be immediate and clear
    And the system should prioritize her survival over perfection
