Scenario: Family care legacy and preparing for Margaret's own aging
    Given Margaret is building care economy capital through current contributions
    And she will need increasing care as she ages
    When the family_elohim tracks care patterns across time
    Then it should show Margaret's accumulated care contributions
    And it should recognize she is building reciprocal relationships
    And it should help family understand care flows across life stages
    And grandchildren learning now will be caregivers later
    And Sarah will reciprocate care as Margaret ages
    And family care economy should be sustainable across time
    And Margaret's current care should create future care security
