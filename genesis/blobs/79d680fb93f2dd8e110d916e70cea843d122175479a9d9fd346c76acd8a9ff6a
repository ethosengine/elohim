Scenario: Creator produces quality educational content that earns reach
    Given Jordan creates a video explaining climate feedback loops
    And the content includes verified scientific sources
    And it's accessible to general audience without oversimplification
    When Jordan contributes the content to climate education affinity network
    Then the verification agent validates the scientific claims
    And the content is offered to climate education communities
    And educators and learners can review and appreciate the content
    And genuine appreciation causes the content to spread to related networks
    And Jordan receives community support for valuable educational work
    And reach is earned through demonstrated value, not algorithms
