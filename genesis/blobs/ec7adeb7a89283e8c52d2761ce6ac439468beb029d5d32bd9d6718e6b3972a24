Scenario: Integration with school curriculum where beneficial
    Given Marcus's real-world learning is substantial
    And school integration could recognize his capabilities
    When Marcus grants permission for school integration
    Then the Value Scanner could share relevant learning data
    And schools could award credit for applied learning
    And his care contributions could supplement traditional coursework
    And integration should benefit Marcus academically
    And his consent and privacy should be absolute requirements
    And school recognition should honor his real-world competence
