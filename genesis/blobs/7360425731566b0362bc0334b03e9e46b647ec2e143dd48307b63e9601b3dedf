Scenario: Balancing care contributions with household needs
    Given Margaret provides extensive care outside her household
    And household tasks still require attention
    When the household_elohim monitors Margaret's overall care burden
    Then it should track time spent on external care commitments
    And it should ensure household needs aren't neglected
    And it should flag if Margaret's care burden becomes overwhelming
    And it should suggest balance between giving and self-care
    And Margaret's own household should remain a priority
    And burnout prevention should be built into system
