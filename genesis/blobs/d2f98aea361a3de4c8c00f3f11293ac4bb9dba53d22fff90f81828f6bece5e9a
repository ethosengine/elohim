Scenario: Monitor municipal wellbeing indicators for policy improvement
    Given Riverside has baseline data on wellbeing before protocol
    When Jamal reviews municipal dashboard annually
    Then dashboard shows life satisfaction trends across neighborhoods
    And dashboard reveals loneliness patterns and interventions
    And dashboard tracks economic resilience indicators
    And dashboard identifies neighborhoods struggling despite protocol
    And Jamal uses data to target policy interventions
    And evidence-based governance improves outcomes
