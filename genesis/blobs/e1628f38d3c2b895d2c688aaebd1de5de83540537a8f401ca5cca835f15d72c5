Feature: Hyperlocal Journalism for Journalist
  As a journalist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want comprehensive neighborhood surveillance infrastructure
  So that hyperlocal journalism can exist despite resource constraints

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the journalist user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active

  Scenario: Journalist monitors all neighborhood meetings despite being one person
    Given the journalist covers 8 neighborhood associations
    And can only attend one meeting per week physically
    When the Observer monitors all neighborhood meetings simultaneously
    Then the journalist reviews transcripts of all 8 weekly meetings
    And receives alerts for newsworthy developments
    And identifies stories across all neighborhoods efficiently
    And comprehensive hyperlocal coverage becomes sustainable
    And no important neighborhood decision goes unreported

  Scenario: Journalist detects gentrification pattern across neighborhoods
    Given individual rent increases in scattered buildings
    And the journalist suspects coordinated displacement
    When the Observer tracks evictions and rent increases across community
    Then the journalist sees systematic pattern of displacement
    And identifies corporate landlord acquiring properties neighborhood-wide
    And documents residents being priced out block by block
    And connects individual stories to structural pattern
    And publishes investigation exposing organized gentrification

  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks developer claims about community support
    Given a developer claims broad community backing for project
    And the journalist investigates at community meeting
    When the Observer analyzes community testimony and meeting history
    Then the journalist sees only 3 community supporters (all with developer ties)
    And finds 47 community members opposed in past meetings
    And verifies developer hired people to testify falsely
    And publishes real-time fact-check of developer claims
    And astroturfing gets exposed through systematic documentation

  Scenario: Journalist investigates playground neglect in underserved neighborhood
    Given residents complain about dangerous playground conditions
    And the journalist needs context on maintenance patterns
    When the Observer provides hyperlocal infrastructure data
    Then the journalist sees playground hasn't been maintained in 5 years
    And compares to monthly maintenance in affluent neighborhoods
    And documents injury reports and resident complaints ignored
    And tracks city budget showing maintenance disparities
    And publishes accountability story on infrastructure racism

  Scenario: Journalist develops sources through community surveillance
    Given the journalist needs community perspectives on proposed development
    And doesn't know who has relevant knowledge
    When the Observer identifies community members affected by issue
    Then the journalist sees residents who testified at past meetings
    And identifies homeowners on blocks facing displacement
    And finds small business owners who will lose customers
    And contacts informed sources with lived experience
    And community journalism reflects actual community voices

  Scenario: Journalist tracks neighborhood promises over time
    Given city officials promised park improvements at community meeting
    And the journalist covers 12 neighborhoods with similar promises
    When the Observer monitors promise implementation across neighborhoods
    Then the journalist receives alert that 18 months have passed
    And sees park still unimproved despite promise
    And identifies pattern of broken promises in communities of color
    And publishes accountability story on systematic neglect
    And institutional memory prevents promises from being forgotten
