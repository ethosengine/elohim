Scenario: Decision fatigue support when every choice drains limited capacity
    Given Maria makes hundreds of decisions daily with no co-parent
    And decision fatigue is real and debilitating
    When the personal_agent detects decision fatigue
    Then it should simplify choices where possible
    And it should provide clear recommendations based on her values and constraints
    And it should reduce decision burden without removing her autonomy
    And it should help her conserve decision-making capacity for critical choices
    And Maria should experience reduced cognitive drain from constant choices
