Scenario: Politician distinguishes education reform evidence from ideology
    Given competing reform proposals claim research support
    And ideological advocacy masks as evidence-based policy
    When the Observer evaluates education research rigorously
    Then they see which reforms have strong evidence base
    And identify advocacy research versus peer-reviewed findings
    And understand limitations and contexts of research claims
    And compare reform outcomes across diverse implementation sites
    And make evidence-based policy decisions beyond ideological fights
