Feature: Local Food Security and Community Agricultural Stewardship
  As a supplier in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want farm to serve community food security and democratic participation
  So that agriculture becomes community institution, not private extraction

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Johnson Farm is located within and serves local community
    And the community governance context is active
    And democratic conversion enables community participation in farm governance

  Scenario: Farm transitions from private land to community food security institution
    Given Johnson Farm was Tom's private property serving his individual livelihood
    And community depended on farm but had no governance participation
    When farm converts to democratic ownership with community investment
    Then community investors gain stake in local food production
    And farm governance includes community voice alongside farmworker control
    And food security becomes community priority, not just individual profit
    And farmland is protected from development through community commitment
    And community_elohim facilitates community participation in farm governance

  Scenario: Community investment enables farm democratic conversion and expansion
    Given Tom wants to convert farm to worker ownership but farmworkers lack capital
    And community members want to support local agriculture but lack pathway
    When community investment pool funds farm acquisition and expansion
    Then neighbors invest $2K-$20K each in democratic farm conversion
    And investors receive fair return (5% annually) plus food security benefit
    And farm gains capital for sustainable infrastructure and expansion
    And community builds ownership stake in local food production
    And community_elohim manages community investment in farm democratization

  Scenario: Farm becomes community educational site for agricultural literacy
    Given urban and suburban residents are disconnected from food production
    And children don't understand where food comes from or how it's grown
    When democratic farm opens to community for education
    Then school groups visit farm learning about agriculture and ecology
    And community members participate in volunteer farm days
    And workshops teach home gardening, food preservation, and nutrition
    And agricultural literacy increases throughout community
    And community_elohim coordinates educational programming at democratic farm

  Scenario: Community-supported agriculture (CSA) program provides affordable local food
    Given fresh, organic produce is often unaffordable for low-income community members
    And food access inequality creates health disparities
    When democratic farm implements sliding-scale CSA program
    Then weekly produce boxes are affordable across income levels
    And payment flexibility (sliding scale, work-trade, subsidized) ensures access
    And direct farm-to-community distribution reduces costs increasing affordability
    And food access improves while supporting fair farmworker wages
    And community_elohim manages CSA program ensuring equitable food access

  Scenario: Farm protects green space and agricultural land from development pressure
    Given farmland faces constant development pressure for housing or commercial use
    And community loses agricultural land, green space, and food production capacity
    When democratic ownership with community investment protects farmland
    Then community investment ensures land remains in agricultural use
    And development pressure is resisted through collective commitment
    And green space is preserved for ecological, aesthetic, and food security benefits
    And community gains protected agricultural land as permanent institution
    And community_elohim coordinates land protection and community land trust options

  Scenario: Local food access points expand through community distribution partnerships
    Given farmers markets and farm visits are not accessible to all community members
    And transportation and schedule barriers limit food access
    When democratic farm partners with community organizations for distribution
    Then produce is delivered to senior centers, community centers, and schools
    And distribution partnerships increase food access for mobility-limited residents
    And community institutions become food access points supporting local agriculture
    And equitable distribution ensures farm benefits entire community
    And community_elohim coordinates community distribution partnerships

  Scenario: Farm employment provides community economic opportunity with dignity
    Given local employment often means low-wage service jobs without advancement
    And agricultural work is typically exploited and underpaid
    When democratic farm offers dignified employment with ownership pathway
    Then community members gain living-wage agricultural employment ($18/hour minimum)
    And employment includes training, ownership potential, and democratic voice
    And youth employment programs connect young people to agriculture
    And farm becomes community economic development asset
    And community_elohim tracks employment outcomes and community economic impact

  Scenario: Community resilience increases through local food production capacity
    Given communities dependent on global supply chains are vulnerable to disruption
    And COVID-19 demonstrated fragility of corporate food system
    When local democratic farm provides community food security
    Then community is less vulnerable to supply chain disruptions
    And local food production capacity serves as resilience infrastructure
    And crisis response can prioritize community feeding over profit
    And democratic governance ensures farm serves community needs during emergencies
    And community_elohim coordinates community resilience and food security planning

  Scenario: Farm hosts community events building social connection and food culture
    Given community lacks gathering spaces for celebration and connection
    And food is central to culture and community building
    When democratic farm space is available for community use
    Then harvest festivals celebrate seasonal abundance and agricultural labor
    And farm dinners feature locally-sourced meals with community storytelling
    And cultural food traditions are shared and preserved through farm programming
    And farm becomes community social infrastructure beyond food production
    And community_elohim facilitates community programming and events at farm

  Scenario: Community oversight ensures environmental stewardship and sustainability
    Given private ownership may prioritize short-term profit over environmental health
    And community bears environmental impacts of farming practices
    When community has governance voice in farm environmental practices
    Then sustainable and regenerative agriculture is prioritized through community input
    And environmental practices are transparent and accountable to community
    And water quality, soil health, and biodiversity are protected as community values
    And farm environmental stewardship benefits entire community ecosystem
    And community_elohim monitors environmental practices and community accountability

  Scenario: Farm supports community food sovereignty and cultural food preservation
    Given corporate food system homogenizes diets and erases cultural food traditions
    And immigrant and indigenous communities lose access to traditional foods
    When democratic farm responds to community cultural food needs
    Then farm grows culturally specific crops (Latino vegetables, Asian greens, indigenous varieties)
    And traditional food knowledge is valued and incorporated into farm planning
    And community food sovereignty increases through local diverse production
    And cultural food preservation becomes farm mission alongside nutrition
    And community_elohim documents and supports cultural food sovereignty initiatives

  Scenario: Community celebrates farm as democratic institution and food security asset
    Given agricultural institutions are typically invisible or taken for granted
    And democratic farm conversion represents major community achievement
    When farm reaches milestones in democratic governance and community service
    Then community celebrates with public events honoring farmworkers and transformation
    And farm story becomes source of community pride and inspiration
    And successful democratic farm model encourages other agricultural conversions
    And community recognizes farm as essential democratic institution
    And community_elohim coordinates celebration events and community farm storytelling
