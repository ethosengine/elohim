Scenario: Developer water quality impacts gain watershed accountability
    Given a developer's projects increase impervious surface and runoff
    And environmental review addressed only immediate site impacts
    When the Observer analyzes watershed-scale water quality impacts
    Then analysis shows: cumulative development degraded stream quality
    And downstream communities face flooding and pollution impacts
    And watershed perspective reveals impacts ignored in site-level review
    And developer contribution to cumulative harm becomes visible
    And watershed accountability demands comprehensive impact assessment
