Scenario: Contributing to community through volunteer work
    Given the local food bank needs volunteers
    And Jordan wants to help community members in need
    When Jordan volunteers at the food bank
    Then tasks are adapted to Jordan's capabilities (sorting, carrying)
    And volunteer coordinators provide clear, accessible instructions
    And Jordan's work genuinely contributes to food bank operations
    And Jordan accumulates care tokens for volunteer service
    And Jordan is recognized as a valued volunteer, not as someone being helped
    And Jordan experiences being a community care provider
    And Jordan's contributions are celebrated authentically
