Scenario: Navigating family expectations about availability
    Given family members may not understand my work constraints
    When family expects more availability than I can provide
    Then the protocol should help me communicate my limitations
    And provide evidence of my actual time and energy constraints
    And support me in setting realistic boundaries
    And help family understand that my constraints reflect employment structure not lack of care
