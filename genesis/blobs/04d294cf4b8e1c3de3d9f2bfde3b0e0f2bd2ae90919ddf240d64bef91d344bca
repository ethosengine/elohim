Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Student
  As a student building care networks in temporary community
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to participate in student mutual aid and broader community care economy
  So that I develop reciprocal relationships that provide support and teach community building

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the student user "Kenji" is registered in the system
    And Kenji participates in student community at his college
    And Kenji is geographically separated from family care networks
    And Kenji needs to build community support in temporary college setting
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim could coordinate care economy networks
    And student community includes formal organizations and informal mutual aid

  Scenario: Student mutual aid networks as care economy foundation
    Given Kenji participates in student mutual aid group
    And students share resources, knowledge, and support
    When the community_elohim tracks mutual aid participation
    Then it should recognize meal sharing as care contribution
    And it should value textbook lending, note sharing, and skill exchange
    And it should accumulate care tokens for helping other students
    And mutual aid should be understood as care economy practice
    And the system should make reciprocal support visible
    And student mutual aid should be recognized as community building

  Scenario: Emergency support through student community networks
    Given Kenji faces unexpected crisis (medical emergency, financial shortfall, housing instability)
    And formal institutions often respond too slowly
    When student community provides emergency support
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate rapid mutual aid
    And it should help students pool resources for peer emergency
    And it should recognize emergency care as high-value contribution
    And it should track "Maya loaned Kenji $100 for urgent medical cost"
    And community should function as immediate safety net
    And student mutual aid should provide crisis intervention

  Scenario: Knowledge and skill sharing in student community
    Given Kenji has environmental science knowledge
    And other students have different expertise
    When students share knowledge freely
    Then the community_elohim should recognize teaching as care work
    And it should value Kenji explaining organic chemistry to struggling peer
    And it should track peer tutoring as community contribution
    And knowledge sharing should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should foster culture of generous knowledge exchange
    And intellectual support should be recognized as care labor

  Scenario: Food sharing and collective cooking in student community
    Given many students face food insecurity
    And collective meals reduce individual costs
    When Kenji participates in community meal sharing
    Then the community_elohim should recognize communal feeding as care work
    And it should value both cooking for others and hosting shared meals
    And it should track "Kenji cooked dinner for 8 people in study group"
    And food sharing should be core care economy practice
    And the system should make nutrition care visible and valued
    And collective eating should build community bonds

  Scenario: Mental health and emotional support in student community
    Given students face high stress, anxiety, and mental health challenges
    And formal mental health services are often inadequate
    When students provide emotional support to peers
    Then the community_elohim should recognize emotional labor as care work
    And it should value listening, validating, and supporting peers in crisis
    And it should accumulate care tokens for emotional care work
    And mental health support should be understood as community care
    And the system should validate peer emotional support as real work
    And student community should be recognized as mental health resource

  Scenario: Collective advocacy for student needs and rights
    Given students face systemic challenges (inadequate financial aid, housing costs, food insecurity)
    And collective action can create change
    When Kenji participates in student organizing
    Then the community_elohim should recognize advocacy as care contribution
    And it should value organizing work, protest participation, and policy advocacy
    And it should accumulate care tokens for working toward collective flourishing
    And advocacy labor should be recognized as community care work
    And the system should support student collective action
    And organizing for justice should be valued as care economy participation

  Scenario: Building community across identity and affinity groups
    Given student community includes diverse identity groups
    And Kenji might participate in environmental student org, cultural groups, academic communities
    When Kenji bridges across different student communities
    Then the community_elohim should recognize bridge-building as care work
    And it should value work connecting different student networks
    And it should show how diverse relationships strengthen overall community
    And coalition building should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should foster inclusive, interconnected community
    And students should learn to build community across difference

  Scenario: Temporary community building as lifelong skill
    Given Kenji's college community is temporary
    And he will leave after graduation
    When the personal_agent reflects on community participation
    Then it should help Kenji see community building as transferable skill
    And it should validate that temporary communities are still real
    And it should teach him that community is built through care relationships
    And the agent should help him understand he'll build community wherever he goes
    And the system should frame student community as practice for lifelong participation
    And Kenji should learn that community is created, not just inherited

  Scenario: Access to community resources during extreme scarcity
    Given Kenji lives on $180/week and might face emergencies
    And community food banks, clothing closets, and support services exist
    When Kenji needs community resources
    Then the community_elohim should connect him to available support
    And it should reduce shame and barriers to access
    And it should frame receiving support as participating in care economy
    And it should recognize that receiving care is part of reciprocity
    And the system should normalize community resource sharing
    And students should access community support with dignity

  Scenario: Community care during academic pressure peaks
    Given exam periods create intense stress across student community
    And everyone is struggling simultaneously
    When student community provides collective support during finals
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate mutual care
    And it should recognize study space hosting, meal provision, emotional support
    And it should value care work that helps community through crisis period
    And collective survival should be recognized as care economy
    And the system should support community resilience
    And students should learn that community carries each other through hard times

  Scenario: Student community as political and cultural force
    Given students are networked, idealistic, and trend-setting
    And student movements have historically created cultural change
    When student community adopts care economy practices
    Then the community_elohim should recognize students as change agents
    And it should support spread of care economy culture among students
    And it should help students see themselves as building alternative economy
    And student community should be recognized as site for cultural transformation
    And the system should empower students as care economy pioneers
    And student adoption could spread care economy to broader generation

  Scenario: Documenting community care contributions for future recognition
    Given Kenji's community care work is currently invisible to traditional economy
    And his care tokens accumulate throughout college
    When Kenji graduates and enters workforce
    Then his care token history should document community leadership and care skills
    And it should translate community organizing to "proven leadership capability"
    And it should show mutual aid coordination as "project management expertise"
    And community care work should be valuable on employment terms
    And the system should help Kenji articulate care economy participation professionally
    And student community work should be recognized as career-relevant experience

  Scenario: Privacy and consent in community data sharing
    Given community coordination requires some information sharing
    And Kenji has full privacy rights
    When the community_elohim manages community information
    Then Kenji must control what community data is shared
    And his participation should be visible only with his consent
    And community care should not require surveillance
    And privacy should be protected while enabling coordination
    And the system should balance community connection with individual privacy
    And Kenji should participate in community on his own terms
