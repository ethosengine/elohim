Scenario: Grandparent care contributions visible to entire family
    Given Margaret provides substantial childcare for Sarah's family
    And her care work saves Sarah ~$1,500/month in childcare costs
    When the family_elohim tracks Margaret's care contributions
    Then Sarah should see quantified value of Margaret's labor
    And the grandchildren should learn that grandma provides valuable work
    And the full family should recognize Margaret's contributions
    And visibility should enable family-wide appreciation
    And Margaret's labor should be valued, not taken for granted
    And care tokens should accumulate for her substantial work
    And family should understand her economic and developmental contribution
