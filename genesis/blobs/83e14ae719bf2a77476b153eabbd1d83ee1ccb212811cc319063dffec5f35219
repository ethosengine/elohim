Scenario: Operator's local relationships become valuable instead of corporate brand dominance
    Given franchise model made operator invisible behind corporate brand
    And James's community relationships were obscured by ChickenMax identity
    When conversion makes his choice visible to community
    Then neighbors learn James chose democratic ownership over continuing corporate extraction
    And local relationships previously invisible become valued and recognized
    And community respects his decision to prioritize workers and neighborhood
    And identity shifts from anonymous franchise operator to community member who chose well
    And workplace_elohim helps communicate transition story to community
