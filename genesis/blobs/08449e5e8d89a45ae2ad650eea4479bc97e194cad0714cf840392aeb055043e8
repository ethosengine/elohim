Scenario: Conservation board member detects greenwashing in sustainability initiative
    Given municipality proposes sustainability plan with ambitious climate goals
    And plan emphasizes renewable energy targets and green building standards
    And board wants to understand if plan will achieve meaningful emissions reductions
    When the board member uses Observer sustainability analysis
    Then they see plan's projected emissions reductions compared to climate science needs
    And discover plan excludes transportation sector responsible for largest emissions
    And find renewable energy targets rely on questionable carbon offset accounting
    And access comparison to peer cities with more comprehensive climate action
    And independent analysis distinguishes authentic sustainability from greenwashing
