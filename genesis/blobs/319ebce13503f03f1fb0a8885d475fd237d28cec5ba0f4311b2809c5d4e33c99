Scenario: Journalist coordinates regional investigation across 15 municipalities
    Given affordable housing crisis affects entire metropolitan region
    And the journalist collaborates with reporters in neighboring coverage areas
    When the Observer provides civic surveillance across all municipalities
    Then journalists access comprehensive data from all 15 cities
    And identify common patterns in zoning and development approval
    And compare policy approaches and housing production outcomes
    And publish coordinated regional investigation
    And local stories reveal regional systemic failure
