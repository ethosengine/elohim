Scenario: Traditional and indigenous agricultural knowledge is honored and integrated
    Given industrial agriculture dismissed traditional ecological knowledge
    And indigenous and traditional practices often embody sustainable wisdom
    When democratic bioregional network values diverse agricultural knowledge
    Then indigenous crop varieties and cultivation methods are preserved and used
    And traditional ecological knowledge informs climate adaptation and biodiversity
    And elder farmers and indigenous practitioners share wisdom with network
    And agricultural knowledge diversity strengthens bioregional resilience
    And bioregional_elohim documents and preserves traditional agricultural knowledge
