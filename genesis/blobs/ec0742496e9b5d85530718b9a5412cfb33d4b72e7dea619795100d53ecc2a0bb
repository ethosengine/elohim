Feature: School District Parent Advocacy
  As a parent in the public_observer system
  Operating at the district governance layer
  I want to influence district decisions affecting my children's education
  So that resource allocation and policies serve student wellbeing not bureaucratic convenience

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user is registered in the system
    And the parent has linked their children's schools and grade levels
    And the district governance context is active

  Scenario: Parent decodes district resource allocation decisions
    Given the school board discusses "optimizing resource distribution"
    And the parent cannot attend the 3-hour Tuesday evening meeting
    When the parent reviews Observer's translated summary
    Then they learn this means cutting 12 teaching positions
    And see this increases their child's class size from 24 to 32 students
    And understand real impact on their child's learning
    And can submit informed opposition via app in 10 minutes
    And bureaucratic language doesn't hide impacts from working parents

  Scenario: Parent exposes systematic school funding inequities
    Given the parent's child attends an eastside elementary school
    And suspects their school gets fewer resources than westside schools
    When the parent reviews Observer's district funding analysis
    Then they see westside schools spend $2,400 more per student
    And westside schools have experienced teachers and enrichment programs
    And eastside schools have newer teachers and cut arts programs
    And pattern of inequity becomes documented and undeniable
    And parent advocacy shifts from suspicion to evidence-based demands

  Scenario: Parent challenges school boundary changes
    Given the district proposes "boundary realignment for efficiency"
    And the parent's child would be moved to a different school
    When the parent reviews Observer's impact analysis
    Then they see which neighborhoods are most affected
    And understand this separates siblings between different schools
    And view maps showing longer commutes for certain families
    And connect with other parents facing same disruption
    And coordinate testimony about family impacts at boundary hearing

  Scenario: Parent tracks school board promises over time
    Given the school board promised to "address transportation issues by Q2"
    And the parent's child still has unreliable bus service three months later
    When the parent checks Observer's commitment tracking
    Then they see the exact promise made in the February meeting
    And view that no action has been taken despite deadline passing
    And can raise specific accountability question at next meeting
    And institutional memory persists beyond administrator turnover
    And board commitments to parents aren't forgotten when attention shifts

  Scenario: Parent discovers teacher coalition opposing same policy
    Given the district proposes eliminating planning periods for teachers
    And the parent sees this will harm their child's education quality
    When the Observer shows teacher union concerns about the policy
    Then the parent understands teachers oppose it for same reasons
    And natural parent-teacher alliance becomes visible
    And parent and teacher testimonies reinforce each other
    And coordinated advocacy prevents divide-and-conquer tactics
    And district can't pit parents against teachers

  Scenario: Parent evaluates school board candidates
    Given three candidates are running for school board seats
    And the parent has limited time to research before the election
    When the parent reviews Observer's candidate analysis
    Then they see each candidate's voting record on key issues
    And view candidates' positions on class sizes and program funding
    And understand which candidates prioritize student needs vs politics
    And can make informed voting decision in 15 minutes
    And democracy extends to education governance elections

  Scenario: Parent coordinates district-wide program cut opposition
    Given the district plans to eliminate music programs to save money
    And the parent's child participates in the school band
    When the Observer connects parents across all affected schools
    Then 230 parents from 8 schools join coordinated advocacy
    And coalition presents unified data on music program benefits
    And shows alternative cost-saving options that preserve programs
    And district-wide parent power prevents divide-and-conquer
    And music programs are preserved through collective action

  Scenario: Parent challenges special education service cuts
    Given the parent's child receives special education services
    And the district proposes reducing support staff "for efficiency"
    When the parent reviews Observer's analysis of legal requirements
    Then they understand federal law mandates these services
    And see which services would be cut and impacts on IEPs
    And connect with other special education parents
    And can cite specific legal protections in testimony
    And district cannot quietly violate disability rights without accountability

  Scenario: Parent tracks implementation of new safety policies
    Given the school board passed new student safety protocols
    And promised implementation at all schools by September
    When September arrives and the parent's school lacks the protocols
    Then the Observer alerts parent about implementation failure
    And shows which schools have implemented vs which haven't
    And reveals pattern of under-resourced schools being deprioritized
    And parent can demand accountability for child safety commitments
    And policy passage doesn't mean policy implementation without tracking
