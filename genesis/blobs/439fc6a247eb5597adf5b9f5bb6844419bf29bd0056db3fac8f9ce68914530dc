Scenario: Making personal choices with accessible interface
    Given Jordan wants to choose their outfit for a community event
    When Jordan opens the Value Scanner wardrobe feature
    Then the interface displays clothing options with large pictures
    And each option uses simple labels ("Blue shirt", "Red sweater")
    And the interface uses step-by-step guidance ("First pick a shirt")
    And Jordan can make their own choice without support worker intervention
    And the system celebrates Jordan's choice with positive feedback
    And Jordan's preference is recorded for future suggestions
