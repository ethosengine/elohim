Scenario: Recognition that grandparenting is care work, not leisure activity
    Given traditional culture frames grandparenting as "fun" and "spoiling"
    And Margaret's labor is often invisible as work
    When the personal_agent characterizes Margaret's activities
    Then it should frame grandparenting as sophisticated care labor
    And it should recognize developmental care, emotional support, practical childcare
    And it should distinguish between leisure time with grandkids and care work
    And it should make visible that Margaret is providing essential services
    And the narrative should shift from "babysitting" to care provision
    And Margaret's work should be taken seriously as economic contribution
    And her care labor should be recognized as valuable work
