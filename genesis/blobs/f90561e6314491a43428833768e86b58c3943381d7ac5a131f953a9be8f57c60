Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Teen
  As a teen (ages 14-17) in the value scanner system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want adult-level economic autonomy with appropriate scaffolding
  So that I build real capability for financial independence and self-governance

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teen user "Jasmine" is registered in the system
    And Jasmine is 16 years old
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Jasmine's personal_agent is configured for adult-level autonomy
    And Jasmine has part-time employment at a local retail store

  Scenario: Adult-capable interface for sophisticated decision-making
    Given Jasmine is using the Value Scanner independently
    And she has complex financial goals and multiple contexts to manage
    When Jasmine opens the scanner application
    Then the interface should provide comprehensive budgeting tools
    And the personal_agent should offer professional-grade financial analysis
    And multi-context care tracking should be available (school, work, family, community)
    And sophisticated planning and analysis features should be accessible
    And privacy controls should be granular and user-controlled
    And the interface should treat Jasmine as the competent person she is

  Scenario: Teen makes independent financial decisions with real consequences
    Given Jasmine is shopping with money from her part-time job
    And she is saving for college expenses
    And she has set a monthly budget of $150 for discretionary spending
    When Jasmine considers purchasing a $60 jacket
    Then her personal_agent should provide decision support without controlling her choice
    And the agent should surface relevant information: "This is 40% of your monthly discretionary budget"
    And the agent should connect to her goals: "You're saving $200/month for college"
    And Jasmine should retain full authority to make the decision
    And the choice should have real economic consequences
    And the system should support learning from mistakes without catastrophic outcomes

  Scenario: Building adult financial capability through practice
    Given Jasmine manages portions of her household budget
    And she has responsibility for weekly grocery shopping
    And her family has allocated $100/week for her to manage
    When Jasmine makes purchasing decisions
    Then her personal_agent should track spending against budget
    And provide analysis of value optimization
    And highlight patterns: "You've stayed within budget 7 of 8 weeks"
    And surface learning opportunities: "Buying bulk rice saved $12 this month"
    And build sophisticated financial literacy through real practice
    And scaffold her capability without removing decision-making authority

  Scenario: Privacy controls honor teen's developing autonomy
    Given Jasmine's care contributions are tracked across multiple contexts
    And she has legitimate need for privacy from parents
    When Jasmine configures her privacy settings
    Then she should have granular control over what data is shared with whom
    And parents should have access to family-relevant information only
    And her personal data (friendships, personal purchases, private reflections) should be protected
    And community resource coordinators should see care contributions but not private details
    And employers should not access her family or school data
    And Jasmine should actively learn to manage privacy boundaries

  Scenario: Recognition of care contributions across multiple life contexts
    Given Jasmine contributes care work in multiple domains
    And she works 15 hours/week at her part-time job
    And she does substantial household labor
    And she volunteers 4 hours/week at community center
    When her personal_agent aggregates her care contributions
    Then all contexts should be recognized: household, paid work, volunteering, civic engagement
    And care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions
    And her work should be made visible as genuine economic participation
    And she should see herself as a productive member of society
    And her care contributions should give her standing in care economy discussions

  Scenario: Personal agent serves as sophisticated decision support system
    Given Jasmine has complex scheduling and coordination needs
    And she balances school, work, family responsibilities, and social life
    When Jasmine uses her personal_agent for planning
    Then the agent should function as financial advisor, schedule coordinator, and career counselor
    And provide information, analysis, and memory support
    And help her see connections: "Your work schedule affects family dinner planning"
    And surface opportunities: "Your community volunteering builds skills for your intended career"
    And never make decisions for her
    And model healthy AI-human partnership where AI amplifies human capability

  Scenario: Value formation through autonomous exploration
    Given Jasmine is consciously forming her personal values
    And she tests values through real economic decisions
    When Jasmine makes purchasing choices reflecting her values
    Then her personal_agent should help her track alignment between values and actions
    And surface patterns: "You've prioritized local/sustainable products 12 of 15 purchases"
    And support her value exploration without imposing external values
    And recognize that she's developing adult value framework
    And protect her space for individual identity development
    And acknowledge her increasing moral sophistication

  Scenario: Savings and investment education through real practice
    Given Jasmine is saving for college and future goals
    And she has accumulated $2,400 in savings from work
    When she explores investment options through her personal_agent
    Then the agent should provide age-appropriate investment education
    And explain concepts like compound interest, risk, diversification
    And connect to her specific goals and timeline
    And help her understand long-term financial planning
    And provide resources for learning about different investment vehicles
    And support her building adult financial capability
    And never pressure her toward specific investment products

  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained for teen autonomy
    Given Jasmine has been using the Value Scanner extensively
    And constitutional constraints protect her agency
    When Jasmine chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then the disconnection must be honored immediately
    And no data retention beyond legal requirements should occur
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
    And her right to not participate must be respected
    And her care contributions should be exportable in standard format
    And she should maintain full control over her participation

  Scenario: Learning from financial mistakes with safety nets
    Given Jasmine overspent her monthly budget by $40
    And she used her college savings to cover the shortfall
    When her personal_agent analyzes the situation
    Then it should provide non-judgmental feedback about the pattern
    And help her understand the long-term impact on her college savings goal
    And support her learning from the mistake
    And suggest strategies for getting back on track
    And not shame or guilt her about the decision
    And recognize that learning requires room for mistakes
    And ensure the mistake isn't catastrophic to her future

  Scenario: Building identity around care contribution and capability
    Given Jasmine has made substantial care contributions over months
    And she balances multiple demanding contexts successfully
    When she reflects on her Value Scanner usage and care economy participation
    Then she should experience herself as a capable, contributing adult
    And her identity should be forming around care for others and community
    And she should understand that her work has genuine economic value
    And she should expect to be taken seriously in economic conversations
    And she should internalize that care economy principles are normal
    And her self-concept should reflect her actual capability and contribution
