Scenario: Household technology adapted for caregiving support
    Given James uses technology for care coordination
    And household needs assistive technology for David
    When household technology is configured
    Then the household_elohim should support care technology integration
    And it should help James use monitoring and safety technology
    And it should ensure technology serves caregiving needs
    And assistive devices should be coordinated through household system
    And technology should reduce burden, not increase complexity
