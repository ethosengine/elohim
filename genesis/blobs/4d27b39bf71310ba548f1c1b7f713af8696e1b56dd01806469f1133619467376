Scenario: Parent translates education-ese to real child impacts
    Given the school board discusses "instructional efficiency optimization"
    And the parent reviews meeting while child does homework
    When the Observer translates the education jargon
    Then the parent learns this means eliminating teaching assistants
    And understands impact is class size increases from 24 to 32 students
    And sees real effect on their child's individual attention
    And can respond to actual impacts vs bureaucratic language
    And education policy becomes accessible to working parents
