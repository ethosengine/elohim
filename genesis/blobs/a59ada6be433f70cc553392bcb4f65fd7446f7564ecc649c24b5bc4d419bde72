Scenario: Workplace relationships and peer support
    Given Kenji works with other employees, many also students
    And workplace can be site of mutual support or competition
    When the workplace_elohim tracks workplace relationships
    Then it should recognize peer support among coworkers as care work
    And it should value helping coworkers, sharing shifts, covering emergencies
    And it should accumulate care tokens for workplace mutual aid
    And worker solidarity should be understood as care economy
    And the system should foster cooperative rather than competitive workplace culture
    And Kenji should build care relationships with fellow workers
