Scenario: Food bank volunteering with dignity for participants
    Given Margaret volunteers at community food bank
    And she also uses food bank resources on her limited budget
    When the community_elohim coordinates food access
    Then Margaret should both contribute and receive without stigma
    And the framing should be community resource sharing, not charity
    And her volunteer labor should give her standing as member, not supplicant
    And she should experience dignity in both giving and receiving
    And community food access should operate on mutual aid principles
    And Margaret should be valued contributor regardless of income
