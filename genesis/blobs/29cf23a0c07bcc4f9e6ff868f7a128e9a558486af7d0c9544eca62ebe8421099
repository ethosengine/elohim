Scenario: Identifying need for constitutional amendment
    Given repeated appeals reveal gap in constitutional framework
    And no interpretation can adequately address the issue
    When we deliberate and recognize amendment is needed
    Then we document: the fundamental gap we've identified
    And we propose: amendment language for consideration
    And we provide: justification grounded in accumulated appeals
    And we submit: proposal to next Global Constitutional Convention
    And we demonstrate: constitution remains living document
    And we enable: constitutional evolution responsive to reality
    And we show: how individual suffering informs systemic improvement
