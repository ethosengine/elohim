Scenario: Citizen participates in park and green space decisions
    Given the city is planning park improvements or closures
    And the citizen values local park access
    When the Observer provides park decision information
    Then the citizen learns about planned changes early enough to respond
    And sees park access and quality distribution across city
    And understands community needs and usage patterns
    And can advocate for equitable green space investment
    And park decisions reflect actual community priorities
