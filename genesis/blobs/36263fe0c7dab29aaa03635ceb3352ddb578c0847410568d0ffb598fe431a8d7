Scenario: Intergenerational teaching builds community connections
    Given Margaret has knowledge valuable to all ages
    And intergenerational programs benefit whole community
    When the educational_elohim facilitates cross-age teaching
    Then Margaret should teach in intergenerational settings
    And her contributions should bridge age segregation
    And younger people should benefit from her wisdom
    And Margaret should learn from younger teachers too
    And intergenerational education should build community bonds
    And age-diverse learning should be normalized and valued
