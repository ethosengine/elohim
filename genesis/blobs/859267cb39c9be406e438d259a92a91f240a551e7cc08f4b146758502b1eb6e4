Scenario: Bioregional governance participation includes ecological voice
    Given bioregional health requires governance that includes ecological considerations
    And Robert participates in community and municipal governance
    And his voice can advocate for bioregional ecological health
    When bioregional_elohim supports ecological governance
    Then it should help Robert bring ecological perspective to governance participation
    And support advocacy for bioregional ecological protection
    And connect him to watershed councils, land use planning, and environmental policy
    And recognize his care economy participation as qualifying him for ecological governance
    And build governance that integrates human and ecological flourishing
    And advance bioregional policy that serves care economy and ecology
    And demonstrate that care economy includes bioregional stewardship
