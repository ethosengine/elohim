Scenario: Community board member tracks implementation of traffic safety improvements
    Given city committed to traffic calming measures after neighborhood advocacy
    And board member wants to ensure promises are implemented
    And community members ask whether improvements are actually happening
    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking
    Then they see timeline of committed improvements versus actual installation
    And discover only partial implementation despite full funding
    And access traffic incident data showing ongoing safety concerns
    And find other neighborhoods received promised improvements faster
    And impact tracking holds city accountable to community commitments
