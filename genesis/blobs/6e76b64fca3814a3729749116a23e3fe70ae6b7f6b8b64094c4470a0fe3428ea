Scenario: Medical care coordination ensures dignity in healthcare system
    Given Helen navigates complex medical systems
    And elderly patients often experience dehumanization
    When Helen interacts with healthcare providers
    Then her personal_agent should advocate for her preferences
    And her advance directives should be communicated to all providers
    And the community_elohim should coordinate across specialists
    And her values should guide medical decisions
    And she should be treated as person, not patient number
    And the protocol should prevent the dehumanization common in elder care
    And medical system should serve Helen's dignity and autonomy
