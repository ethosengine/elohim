Scenario: Neighborhood mutual aid networks recognize preteen contributions
    Given Marcus's family both needs and provides care
    And neighborhood mutual aid operates on reciprocity
    When neighborhood care networks are coordinated
    Then Marcus's household labor should be visible to mutual aid networks
    And his contributions should qualify family for receiving support
    And the framing should be reciprocal care, not charity
    And Marcus gives care (household management); community gives care (support)
    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate these exchanges
    And dignity should be preserved through reciprocity framework
