Scenario: Coordinating volunteer participation with other life commitments
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week
    And he also provides family care and participates in neighborhood governance
    When the community_elohim coordinates his participation
    Then it should integrate volunteer work with other commitments
    And help Frank maintain sustainable participation level
    And prevent volunteer burnout through overcommitment
    And coordinate scheduling across community, family, and neighborhood
    And support Frank in balancing diverse care contributions
    And enable long-term sustainable volunteer engagement
