Scenario: Creating household stability and joy amid ongoing crisis
    Given my children need not just survival but moments of normalcy and happiness
    And resources for "extras" are nonexistent
    When I try to create positive household experiences
    Then the Value Scanner helps me identify low-cost/no-cost ways to create joy
    And surfaces community resources for children's activities and experiences
    And helps me maintain household traditions and celebrations
    And reminds me that emotional presence matters more than material provision
    And tracks moments of household happiness and connection
    And my personal_agent suggests activities that fit our constraints
    And recognizes emotional care work as valuable as material provision
    And validates that I am providing good childhood despite circumstances
