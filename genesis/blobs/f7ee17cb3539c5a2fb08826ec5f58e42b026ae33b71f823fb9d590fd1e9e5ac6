Scenario: Mayor evaluates development proposal with comprehensive impact analysis
    Given a developer proposes mixed-use project with rosy projections
    And activists present worst-case scenarios in opposition
    When the politician requests Observer impact analysis
    Then they see developer's track record on past projects in other cities
    And review infrastructure capacity data (traffic, water, schools)
    And understand economic benefits distribution (jobs for whom, tax revenue timing)
    And identify community costs and trade-offs objectively
    And make informed decision beyond political calculations
