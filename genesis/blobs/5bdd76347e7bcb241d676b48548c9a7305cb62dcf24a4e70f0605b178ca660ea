Scenario: Municipal economic development metrics expand beyond job quantity to job quality
    Given cities typically measure economic development by jobs created
    And job quality (wages, benefits, dignity, ownership) is often ignored
    When Rosa's conversion demonstrates high-quality job creation
    Then municipality tracks worker ownership, living wages, and benefits in economic development data
    And democratic conversions score highly on job quality metrics
    And city economic development strategy prioritizes quality over quantity
    And officials recognize one living-wage worker-owner job exceeds three poverty-wage positions
    And municipality_elohim provides quality-focused metrics and documentation
