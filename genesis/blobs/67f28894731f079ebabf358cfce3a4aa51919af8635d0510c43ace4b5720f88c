Scenario: Part-time work options during intensive parenting periods
    Given some life stages require more intensive parenting presence
    And Maria may need reduced hours during children's critical developmental periods
    When Maria's care responsibilities temporarily increase
    Then workplace should offer part-time or reduced hours options
    And reduced schedule should not mean permanent career penalty or benefit loss
    And single parents should be able to modulate work based on care needs
    And career paths should accommodate care economy participation
    And Maria should have flexibility to adjust work commitment based on family needs
