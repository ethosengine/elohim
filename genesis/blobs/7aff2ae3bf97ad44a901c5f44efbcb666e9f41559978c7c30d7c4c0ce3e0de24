Scenario: Board member understands community priorities on curriculum controversy
    Given board faces decision on proposed curriculum adoption
    And board meetings dominated by organized groups advocating strong positions
    And board wants to understand broader parent and educator perspectives
    When the board member seeks community accountability data from Observer
    Then they receive survey data from representative sample of district families
    And see teacher professional judgment on curriculum separate from union position
    And access student learning outcome data from districts using proposed curriculum
    And understand concerns of diverse communities beyond organized advocacy
    And community accountability helps board make decision aligned with broader interests
