Scenario: Appeal challenges national protocol implementation standard
    Given agent decisions nationwide follow certain implementation standard
    And I believe this standard violates constitutional principles
    When I appeal to national level challenging the standard itself
    Then National Constitutional Council evaluates the implementation against constitution
    And They examine if nationwide practice has drifted from constitutional alignment
    And They consider impact on millions if standard is changed
    And They balance consistency benefits with constitutional correction need
    And They may order national recalibration of agent behavior
    And My individual appeal triggers systemic constitutional review
    And Protocol governance remains accountable to constitutional principles at scale
