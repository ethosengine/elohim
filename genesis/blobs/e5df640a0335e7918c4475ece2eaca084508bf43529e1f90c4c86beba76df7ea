Scenario: Managing neighborhood privacy while building community connections
    Given I need privacy about my location and circumstances for safety
    And I also need genuine community connections
    When I balance privacy protection with community participation
    Then the Value Scanner helps me maintain appropriate boundaries
    And guides what's safe to disclose in neighborhood context
    And validates that selective disclosure is appropriate
    And helps me build authentic connections without oversharing
    And tracks who knows what about my situation
    And my personal_agent alerts me to privacy risks
    And recognizes boundary management as constant cognitive work
    And supports both safety and genuine belonging
