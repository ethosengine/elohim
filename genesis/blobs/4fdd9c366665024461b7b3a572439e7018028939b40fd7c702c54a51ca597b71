Scenario: Temporary community building as lifelong skill
    Given Kenji's college community is temporary
    And he will leave after graduation
    When the personal_agent reflects on community participation
    Then it should help Kenji see community building as transferable skill
    And it should validate that temporary communities are still real
    And it should teach him that community is built through care relationships
    And the agent should help him understand he'll build community wherever he goes
    And the system should frame student community as practice for lifelong participation
    And Kenji should learn that community is created, not just inherited
