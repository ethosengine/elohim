**Introduction:** It’s tempting to think that all we need is more technology to solve all our problems. After all, hasn’t technology solved so many of our problems to date?  
Once we’re operating at an unsustainably extractive scale, attempts to address the problems created by technology with more technology are likely to lead to a larger set of problems.

To steal a phrase from Dave Ramsey, when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging, that's what Minimizing Harmful Consequences is about, identifiying the externalities that are growing outside of our balance sheet. 

The lesson we learned from the Prable of the Polygon is this.   
1\. Small individual bias → Large collective bias. \-When someone says a culture is shapist, they're not saying the individuals in it are shapist. They're not attacking you personally.  
2\. The past haunts the present. \-Your bedroom floor doesn't stop being dirty just cuz you stopped dropping food all over the carpet. Creating equality is like staying clean: it takes work. And it's always a work in progress.  
3\. Demand diversity near you. \- If small biases created the mess we're in, small anti-biases might fix it. Look around you. Your friends, your colleagues, that conference you're attending. If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life \- that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors.

Because the problems we are discussing are often externalities produced by the things that we are doing more of, regenerative solutions are oftentimes found in understanding what we could do less.

**Conclusion:** We should be seeking faith-based models that go beyond "serving the poor" to truly embodying inclusive ways of being the church. Here are some organizations and movements that approach regenerative practices from a faith perspective, with an emphasis on inclusivity and systemic change:

Wild Church Network: A collective of faith communities that meet outside and focus on reconnecting people with nature, emphasizing ecological spirituality and stewardship.  
Parish Collective: Cultivates neighborhood-rooted communities that are inclusive, creative, and committed to the flourishing of their local contexts.  
New Monasticism: A movement that seeks to embody Christian community in intentional, inclusive ways, often in marginalized neighborhoods.  
Eco-Congregation: An ecumenical program helping churches make the link between environmental issues and Christian faith, and respond in practical action.  
Creation Justice Ministries: Represents the creation care and environmental justice policies of major Christian denominations, focusing on systemic change.  
The Oikos Institute: A Christian think tank exploring regenerative economics and sustainable development from a theological perspective.  
The Transforming Center: Offers resources for church leaders to cultivate spiritual transformation, including practices that foster inclusive community.  
The Missional Wisdom Foundation: Experiments with and teaches about alternative forms of Christian community, emphasizing inclusivity and sustainability.  
The Catholic Climate Covenant: Addresses climate change from a faith perspective, emphasizing integral ecology and community-based solutions.  
Bartimaeus Cooperative Ministries: Integrates biblical study with ecological and economic literacy, and radical discipleship in local contexts.

These organizations tend to emphasize:

Whole-community approaches rather than top-down charity models  
Integration of ecological concerns with social and spiritual practices  
Reimagining church structures and practices for greater inclusivity and sustainability  
Connecting faith principles with concrete action for systemic change

They offer models of how faith communities can embody regenerative practices in inclusive ways, seeing themselves as part of the ecosystem they're trying to heal and transform, rather than as outside saviors.

### Bible Reference(s)

( Prophetic Imagination? )

Acts 2:42-47 The Fellowship of the Believers (Right-sizing) 

42And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 43And awed came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 44And all who believed were together and had all things in common. 45And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 46And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

“Thus says the Lord of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord.” Then the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? Now, therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways. You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes. “Thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways. Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the Lord. You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the Lord of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house. Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors.”  
Haggai 1:2‭-‬11 ESV

### Story 

Matthew 6: Giving to the Needy  
6 “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

2 “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

Prayer  
5 “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

9 “This, then, is how you should pray:

“‘Our Father in heaven,  
hallowed be your name,  
10 your kingdom come,  
your will be done,  
    on earth as it is in heaven.  
11 Give us today our daily bread.  
12 And forgive us our debts,  
    as we also have forgiven our debtors.  
13 And lead us not into temptation,\[a\]  
    but deliver us from the evil one.\[b\]’

14 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

Fasting  
16 “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 17 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18 so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

Treasures in Heaven  
19 “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

22 “The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy,\[c\] your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eyes are unhealthy,\[d\] your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness\!

24 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.

Do Not Worry  
25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life\[e\]?

28 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

### Discussion Question or Activity

How can churches embody Christ's vision of regeneration and reconciliation in their use and development of technology, while avoiding the pitfalls of extractive systems and harmful externalities?"

This question encourages students to:

Reflect on Jesus' teachings about regeneration and reconciliation in light of modern technological challenges.  
Consider how churches can model humane technology practices that align with Kingdom values.  
Critically examine current church practices that may unintentionally contribute to extractive or harmful systems.  
Brainstorm practical ways churches can shift towards more regenerative and reconciliatory approaches to technology use and development.  
Explore the tension between growth/expansion and sustainability/stewardship in both technological and spiritual contexts.  
Apply concepts from the CHT course like externalities, regenerative systems, and "binding scale to responsibility" to a church context.  
Discuss how churches can be prophetic voices advocating for more humane technology in broader society.

This question invites rich discussion that bridges theological reflection, practical application, and critical analysis of current practices \- key goals for this Christian companion course to the CHT material.

### Conclusion

 We should be seeking faith-based models that go beyond "serving the poor" to truly embodying inclusive ways of being the church. Here are some organizations and movements that approach regenerative practices from a faith perspective, with an emphasis on inclusivity and systemic change:

Wild Church Network: A collective of faith communities that meet outside and focus on reconnecting people with nature, emphasizing ecological spirituality and stewardship.  
Parish Collective: Cultivates neighborhood-rooted communities that are inclusive, creative, and committed to the flourishing of their local contexts.  
New Monasticism: A movement that seeks to embody Christian community in intentional, inclusive ways, often in marginalized neighborhoods.  
Eco-Congregation: An ecumenical program helping churches make the link between environmental issues and Christian faith, and respond in practical action.  
Creation Justice Ministries: Represents the creation care and environmental justice policies of major Christian denominations, focusing on systemic change.  
The Oikos Institute: A Christian think tank exploring regenerative economics and sustainable development from a theological perspective.  
The Transforming Center: Offers resources for church leaders to cultivate spiritual transformation, including practices that foster inclusive community.  
The Missional Wisdom Foundation: Experiments with and teaches about alternative forms of Christian community, emphasizing inclusivity and sustainability.  
The Catholic Climate Covenant: Addresses climate change from a faith perspective, emphasizing integral ecology and community-based solutions.  
Bartimaeus Cooperative Ministries: Integrates biblical study with ecological and economic literacy, and radical discipleship in local contexts.

These organizations tend to emphasize:

Whole-community approaches rather than top-down charity models  
Integration of ecological concerns with social and spiritual practices  
Reimagining church structures and practices for greater inclusivity and sustainability  
Connecting faith principles with concrete action for systemic change

They offer models of how faith communities can embody regenerative practices in inclusive ways, seeing themselves as part of the ecosystem they're trying to heal and transform, rather than as outside saviors.

### Application 

(This section should have One-To-One applications with Minimizing Harmful Consequences)   
\* We must see ourselves as Christans in a universal sense, if we are growing because other smaller congregations aren't as resourced are as capable as we are, or poaching from other christian communities, does not count toward growth as a body.   
\-- As such, we should develop some ministry which seeks the development and success of other communities of christians, what we do well MUST be shared with the body, the full body of Christ.  
\-- Church planting, building campaigns, or relocating should regenrate places that we previously have been. (San Pedro \-\> Thousand Oaks)

\* We need to maximize the sustainability of our operations where we can, large buildings, debt-servicing (but provides loans and grants), huge energy bills (operate with renewable energy), transportation (make everywhere we for people first (walk, bike, tansit), deliver health-care, social services , risk-transfer (stabilize incomes).

\* We need a positive model for political discernment of the body which is judged by real measurable outcomes not lipservice to stated goals, we cannot be a community which serves the poor, prisoners, immigrants, orphans, and widows, while voting for a political representatives who impoverish, imprison, criminalize, orphan, and widow.  ( We cannot continue sinning, \[or advocate for consequences\], so that grace may abound )

\* Our lives must reflect our identity as christians,   
\--if we-members are working in industry that is generating externalities, we could dedicate capacity to helping people re-align their vocation with those values, without penalty or disruption.   
\--if we-members are living in such a way that is generating externalities (Parable of the Polygons), we should encourage people to make active choices and not rely on passive hope that someone will happen upon what a life well lived looks like.
