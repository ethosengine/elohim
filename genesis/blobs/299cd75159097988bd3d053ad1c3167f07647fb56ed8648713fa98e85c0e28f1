Scenario: Emergency preparedness includes disability considerations
    Given emergencies affect disabled people disproportionately
    And Alex has specific emergency needs
    When the neighborhood plans for emergencies
    Then Alex should be included in emergency planning
    And neighborhood should know about residents with access needs
    And evacuation plans should accommodate wheelchair users
    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate disability-inclusive preparedness
    And Alex's expertise should shape neighborhood emergency protocols
    And disabled neighbors should be protected, not forgotten
    And inclusive planning should reduce vulnerability for all residents
