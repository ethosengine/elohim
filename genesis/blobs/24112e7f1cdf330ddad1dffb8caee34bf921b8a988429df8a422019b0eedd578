Scenario: Municipal planning commission uses agent constitutional analysis
    Given planning commission reviews development proposals
    And developments affect multiple neighborhoods and city environment
    When Municipal Elohim provides constitutional analysis
    Then agent flags: if development would harm watershed
    And agent assesses: effects on housing affordability, traffic, equity
    And agent provides: constitutional principles analysis
    And planning commission: still makes final decision
    And commissioners: use information but maintain judgment authority
    And development review: incorporates constitutional considerations
    And city planning: serves broader values beyond narrow economics
