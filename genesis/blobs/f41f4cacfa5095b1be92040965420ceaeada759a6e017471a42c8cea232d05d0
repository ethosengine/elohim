Scenario: Neighborhood food cooperative participation on fixed income
    Given Margaret's $150/week budget could benefit from bulk buying
    And neighbors face similar budget constraints
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies food cooperative opportunities
    Then Margaret should be connected to bulk buying networks
    And her participation should reduce her grocery costs
    And she should contribute her time and organizational skills
    And the cooperative should reduce individual household scarcity
    And neighborhood coordination should make fixed incomes stretch further
    And collective action should create better outcomes than individual effort
