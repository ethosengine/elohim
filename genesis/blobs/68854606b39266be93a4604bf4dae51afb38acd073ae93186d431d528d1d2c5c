Scenario: Community recognizes preteen caregivers without exploitation
    Given Marcus represents many young people with household responsibilities
    And community should support rather than exploit young caregivers
    When the community_elohim identifies preteen caregivers
    Then it should channel appropriate support to these families
    And it should prevent exploitation of children's labor
    And it should work to reduce excessive burden on young people
    And it should advocate for family support that makes Marcus's work unnecessary
    And paradoxically, while recognizing his work, it should work toward making it optional
    And care economy should support children while addressing systemic issues
