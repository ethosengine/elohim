Scenario: Developmental stage appropriate learning through concrete experience
    Given Tommy is learning value literacy
    And he is at the concrete operational stage
    When Tommy makes a care decision in the scanner
    Then the personal_agent should frame choices as care adventures
    And complex economic concepts should not be presented
    And learning should happen through story and relationship
    And the agent should ask "What will make Emma smile?" not "What's the best value?"
    And Tommy should build neural pathways around care-based decision making
