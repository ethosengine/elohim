Scenario: Building community care relationships that will endure beyond crisis
    Given I am building relationships during crisis period
    And some relationships could become long-term community connections
    When I invest in community relationships
    Then the Value Scanner helps me identify relationships with potential for depth
    And supports genuine connection beyond transactional support
    And facilitates relationship development over time
    And tracks meaningful community relationships
    And validates that vulnerable people build valuable friendships
    And my personal_agent nurtures relationships that provide belonging
    And recognizes community-building as important social infrastructure
    And celebrates friendships that survive crisis transition
