Scenario: Teen's care contributions give standing in municipal conversations
    Given Jasmine has accumulated significant care economy participation
    And she contributes household labor, paid work, volunteering, and civic engagement
    When municipal discussions about youth policy occur
    Then her care contributions should give her legitimate standing
    And municipal_elohim should recognize her as a constitutional participant
    And she should not be dismissed due to age
    And her voice should carry weight based on demonstrated contribution
    And the municipality should recognize teens as current participants, not future constituents
    And youth civic engagement should be valued as care work for democratic governance
