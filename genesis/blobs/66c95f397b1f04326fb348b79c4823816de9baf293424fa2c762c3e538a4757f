Scenario: Managing shared household budget
    Given household members share rent and utilities
    And my income is limited and variable
    When we manage shared expenses
    Then the protocol should track contributions transparently
    And accommodate my tight budget constraints
    And facilitate fair cost distribution
    And help us optimize shared household economics
