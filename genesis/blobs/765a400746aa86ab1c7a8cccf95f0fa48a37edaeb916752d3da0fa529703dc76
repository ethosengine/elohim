Scenario: Informal learning and developmental support recognized as education
    Given Margaret teaches grandchildren through daily interactions
    And she provides learning opportunities through play, conversation, activities
    When the educational_elohim tracks Margaret's educational contributions
    Then it should recognize informal teaching as valuable education
    And it should value developmental care as sophisticated work
    And it should track learning moments and educational interactions
    And informal education should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's teaching should be recognized alongside formal schooling
    And grandparent education should be valued as essential learning
