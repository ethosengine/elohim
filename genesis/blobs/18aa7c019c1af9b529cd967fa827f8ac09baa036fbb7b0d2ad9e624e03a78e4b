Scenario: Manager coordinates community programs while workers govern priorities
    Given workers democratically decided to implement senior meal program
    And operational coordination is needed for program execution
    When Marcus coordinates senior meal program logistics
    Then Marcus ensures meals meet quality and dietary requirements
    And Marcus coordinates with senior center on scheduling and delivery
    And Marcus tracks program metrics (meals served, costs, feedback)
    But workers determine program scope, pricing, and continuation
    And community_elohim ensures program serves community without exploiting workers
