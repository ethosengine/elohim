Scenario: Alex mentors other disabled neighbors in advocacy
    Given other disabled people live in the neighborhood
    And many lack confidence in self-advocacy
    When Alex supports other disabled neighbors
    Then this peer mentoring should be recognized as care work
    And the neighborhood_elohim should track Alex's support to disabled community
    And Alex's disability expertise benefits other residents significantly
    And peer support should accumulate care tokens appropriately
    And Alex's leadership in disability community should be valued
    And mentoring should be seen as sophisticated care labor
    And the protocol should recognize Alex's role building disability solidarity
