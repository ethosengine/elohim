Scenario: Municipal care token supplements support low-income families
    Given Sarah's household income is $65k/year
    And many families have less economic resources
    When municipal care economy operates
    Then care token supplements should be available based on income
    And the Value Scanner should be accessible regardless of ability to pay
    And municipal subsidies should ensure universal access
    And care economy should function as economic support system
    And access should be dignified and universal
