Scenario: Activist tracks local environmental justice issues
    Given pollution sources affect the activist's community
    And residents report health concerns
    When the Observer documents environmental conditions
    Then the activist sees air quality trends by neighborhood
    And maps proximity of industrial facilities to residences
    And tracks permit violations and regulatory responses
    And organizes community for accountability demands
    And environmental racism becomes documented and actionable
