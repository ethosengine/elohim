Scenario: Managing workplace disclosure about domestic violence or crisis circumstances
    Given employers may ask about gaps, circumstances, or background
    And disclosure could lead to discrimination or could generate support
    When I decide what to disclose to employers
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me evaluate disclosure risks and benefits
    And provides guidance on legal protections against discrimination
    And suggests strategic disclosure approaches when disclosure is beneficial
    And validates my right to privacy about personal circumstances
    And helps me navigate background checks or verification issues
    And my personal_agent reminds me of what I've decided to disclose vs. protect
    And recognizes disclosure decisions as complex risk assessment
    And supports my autonomy in disclosure choices
