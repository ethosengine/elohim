Scenario: Building care relationships that will support Margaret's aging
    Given Margaret is building neighborhood relationships now
    And she will need neighborhood support as she ages
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks care relationship development
    Then it should recognize Margaret is building care economy capital
    And her current contributions should create future reciprocity
    And neighbors she helps now will help her later
    And neighborhood care networks should support aging in place
    And Margaret's care work should enable her own aging in community
    And neighborhood relationships should provide long-term security
