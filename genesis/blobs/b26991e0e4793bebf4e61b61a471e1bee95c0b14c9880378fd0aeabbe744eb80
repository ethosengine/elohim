Scenario: Climate-displaced community maintains cohesion across distance
    Given a coastal town is gradually becoming uninhabitable due to flooding
    And families are relocating to various inland communities over several years
    When displaced community members use Elohim to stay connected
    And they create a diaspora community space for their town
    Then families scattered across multiple cities maintain relationships
    And community memory and culture are preserved
    And mutual aid flows between dispersed community members
    And collective decision-making continues about remaining community assets
    And the community maintains identity despite geographic dispersal
