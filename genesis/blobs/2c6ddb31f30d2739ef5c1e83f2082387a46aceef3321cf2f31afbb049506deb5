Scenario: Workplace serves teen's development, not just employer's profit
    Given Jasmine's work should contribute to her flourishing
    And employment should support her transition to adulthood
    When workplace_elohim evaluates the work relationship
    Then it should assess whether work supports her development
    And flag if work interferes with education or wellbeing
    And recognize if employer is investing in her skill development
    And identify if work experience is building her career capability
    And advocate that employment should serve mutual benefit
    And help her understand that healthy employment supports worker flourishing
