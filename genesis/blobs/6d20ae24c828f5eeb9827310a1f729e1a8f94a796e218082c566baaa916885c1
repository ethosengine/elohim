Scenario: Access to community resources during extreme scarcity
    Given Kenji lives on $180/week and might face emergencies
    And community food banks, clothing closets, and support services exist
    When Kenji needs community resources
    Then the community_elohim should connect him to available support
    And it should reduce shame and barriers to access
    And it should frame receiving support as participating in care economy
    And it should recognize that receiving care is part of reciprocity
    And the system should normalize community resource sharing
    And students should access community support with dignity
