Feature: Community Layer Care Economy Integration for Elderly
  As an elderly person in the value scanner system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want my lifetime contributions to create legitimate claims on community support
  So that assistance flows to me with dignity as reciprocity, not charity

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elderly user "Helen" is registered in the system
    And Helen has $24k/year fixed income (Social Security only)
    And Helen has decades of community contributions
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim coordinates care economy networks

  Scenario: Lifetime contributions create legitimate claims on community support
    Given Helen has contributed to community for 60+ years of adult life
    And she now requires substantial assistance
    When Helen accesses community care resources
    Then her care tokens should reflect decades of contribution
    And community support should be framed as reciprocity
    And she should not experience shame about needing help
    And assistance should flow as legitimate return on lifetime of giving
    And the community_elohim should make her contribution history visible
    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy honors lifetime reciprocity
    And Helen should experience dignity, not charity

  Scenario: Community care coordination across multiple service providers
    Given Helen receives support from multiple sources
    And coordination prevents gaps and duplication
    When the community_elohim tracks Helen's care network
    Then it should coordinate home health aides, medical providers, and volunteers
    And it should identify gaps before they become crises
    And it should prevent duplication of services
    And it should ensure Helen's preferences are communicated across providers
    And care should happen around Helen, not to her
    And the protocol should provide infrastructure for complex care coordination
    And Helen should be center of coordinated care web

  Scenario: Senior center programs maintain social connection and engagement
    Given Helen participates in senior center activities
    And social connection prevents isolation and decline
    When Helen engages with senior center programs
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate transportation
    And accessibility should be ensured for all programs
    And her participation should be recognized as community contribution
    And programs should preserve dignity and agency
    And senior centers should be spaces of continued growth, not warehousing
    And the protocol should support elder engagement in community life
    And Helen should experience valued participation, not make-work

  Scenario: Food assistance programs accessed without stigma
    Given Helen's $24k/year barely covers basic needs
    And she needs food assistance to survive
    When Helen accesses food programs through care economy
    Then assistance should be presented as legitimate reciprocity
    And no stigma should attach to receiving support
    And her lifetime of contributions should frame current assistance
    And food access should be coordinated through community_elohim
    And dignity should be preserved throughout assistance
    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy eliminates charity model
    And Helen should receive support as right based on contributions, not as failure

  Scenario: Medical care coordination ensures dignity in healthcare system
    Given Helen navigates complex medical systems
    And elderly patients often experience dehumanization
    When Helen interacts with healthcare providers
    Then her personal_agent should advocate for her preferences
    And her advance directives should be communicated to all providers
    And the community_elohim should coordinate across specialists
    And her values should guide medical decisions
    And she should be treated as person, not patient number
    And the protocol should prevent the dehumanization common in elder care
    And medical system should serve Helen's dignity and autonomy

  Scenario: Community resource allocation prioritizes aging in place
    Given community resources are limited
    And policy choices affect elder care
    When community governance makes allocation decisions
    Then the community_elohim should surface elder needs
    And aging in place should be prioritized over institutionalization
    And Helen's voice should be included in community decisions
    And resources should flow to enable dignity-preserving care
    And the protocol should inform community policy
    And care economy data should demonstrate what elders need to flourish
    And community should invest in infrastructure that serves all ages

  Scenario: Volunteer care networks prevent institutional warehousing
    Given institutional care strips autonomy and dignity
    And community care networks can enable aging in place
    When volunteers provide support for Helen
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate volunteer schedules
    And volunteer care work should be recognized with care tokens
    And Helen should remain in her home and community
    And care should be provided with dignity and respect
    And the protocol should demonstrate alternative to institutional model
    And community care economy should prove that dignified elder care is possible at scale
    And success should show that we can care for our elders without warehousing them

  Scenario: Community memory projects value elderly wisdom
    Given Helen holds decades of lived experience
    And community memory has cultural value
    When community memory projects are organized
    Then Helen should be invited to participate as valued contributor
    And her stories should be captured for community archive
    And her participation should be recognized as contribution
    And care tokens should reflect her memory-keeping work
    And the community_elohim should facilitate intergenerational knowledge transfer
    And the protocol should make visible that elders contribute to collective knowledge
    And community should benefit from elder wisdom

  Scenario: Healthcare costs managed through community care economy
    Given Helen faces overwhelming healthcare expenses
    And medical debt threatens her housing stability
    When healthcare costs are tracked
    Then the community_elohim should help navigate cost assistance
    And community care economy should supplement inadequate insurance
    And medical care should not require choosing between health and housing
    And Helen's contributions should create claims on community health resources
    And the protocol should address the healthcare affordability crisis for elderly
    And community networks should provide economic buffer against medical costs
    And care economy should demonstrate healthcare as community responsibility

  Scenario: Elder abuse prevention through community monitoring
    Given elderly people are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation
    And community networks can identify concerning patterns
    When the community_elohim detects potential abuse indicators
    Then it should alert appropriate authorities
    And Helen's safety should be prioritized
    And intervention should preserve her autonomy where possible
    And community should protect vulnerable members
    And the protocol should provide infrastructure for elder protection
    And abuse prevention should be community responsibility
    And Helen should be safe in her community

  Scenario: Advance care planning supported by community resources
    Given Helen is planning for end of life
    And advance care planning is complex
    When Helen accesses community advance planning support
    Then the community_elohim should connect her to counseling resources
    And her advance directives should be documented in accessible format
    And her wishes should be communicated across care networks
    And community should support death with dignity
    And the protocol should enable agency over end of life
    And Helen's values should guide her death as they guided her life
    And community care economy should extend through end of life

  Scenario: Intergenerational care economy makes elder value visible
    Given care economy spans all ages and capabilities
    And Helen both receives and gives care
    When community care tokens are tracked
    Then Helen's lifetime contributions should be visible to community
    And her current contributions should be recognized alongside care receipt
    And younger generations should see care flowing across entire lifespan
    And the protocol should demonstrate that humans have value at all ages
    And community should learn that care reciprocity spans generations
    And success should prove that care economy values elders as full participants
    And Helen should experience community standing based on lifetime of contribution
