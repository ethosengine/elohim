Scenario: Investment in land trusts protects bioregional ecological integrity
    Given land speculation threatens farmland, forests, and ecosystems
    And Patricia values protecting bioregional ecological infrastructure
    When community investment supports community land trusts
    Then agricultural land is permanently protected from development
    And forests and watersheds are stewarded for ecological health, not timber extraction
    And bioregional ecological integrity is preserved through democratic land governance
    And investment protects ecosystems while generating sustainable returns
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates land trust investment and stewardship
