Scenario: Track appeal status and progress
    Given Marcus has submitted an appeal
    When Marcus checks his appeal status
    Then he sees current review stage clearly displayed
    And he sees estimated timeline for each stage
    And he receives notifications at key milestones
    And he can compare his case to similar anonymized appeals
    And he can access precedent cases involving mental health interventions
    And the tracking interface is accessible on all his devices
