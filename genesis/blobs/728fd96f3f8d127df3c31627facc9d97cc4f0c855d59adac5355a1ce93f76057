Scenario: Food waste prevention driven by economic necessity
    Given Maria cannot afford to waste food on $175/week grocery budget
    And she carefully plans meals, uses leftovers, and minimizes spoilage
    When household food waste is tracked
    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify her minimal food waste
    And it should recognize that she achieves what environmental advocates aim for
    And her food waste prevention should be valued as ecological contribution
    And economic necessity should be honored as environmental effectiveness
    And Maria should be recognized as food sustainability leader
