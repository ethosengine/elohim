Scenario: Community care contributions qualify Sarah for leadership
    Given Sarah has accumulated substantial care contributions
    And community leadership positions require demonstrated commitment
    When community selects leaders
    Then Sarah's quantified care work should be visible evidence
    And her school involvement should be tracked
    And her food cooperative participation should be recognized
    And her community organizing should be valued
    And leadership should go to those who demonstrate care, not just those who talk
    And care economy should create accountability in community governance
