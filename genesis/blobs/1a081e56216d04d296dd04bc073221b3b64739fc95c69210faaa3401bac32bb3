Scenario: Building nutrition awareness while managing costs
    Given Aisha has been working through lunch frequently
    And her energy levels are declining
    When the personal_agent reviews her eating patterns
    Then it should flag the concerning pattern
    And it should say "You've worked through lunch four days this week"
    And it should suggest quick, nutritious options within budget
    And the agent should help her see self-care as essential, not optional
    And recommendations should balance nutrition, cost, and time constraints
