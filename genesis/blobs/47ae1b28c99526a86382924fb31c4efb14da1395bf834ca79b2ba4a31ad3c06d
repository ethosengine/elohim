Scenario: Personal financial management integrated with care economy
    Given Sarah manages household finances on $65k/year combined income
    And budgeting is complex across multiple care contexts
    When Sarah makes purchasing decisions
    Then her personal_agent should track budget in real-time
    And it should integrate financial constraints with nutritional needs, developmental appropriateness, family values
    And it should help Sarah make informed trade-offs
    And financial tools should serve care economy goals, not just spending tracking
    And budget management should feel supportive, not restrictive
