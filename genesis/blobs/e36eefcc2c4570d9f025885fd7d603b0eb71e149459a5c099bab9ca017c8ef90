Scenario: Moderator coordinates with other moderators on cross-community issue
    Given a coordinated harassment campaign targets multiple communities
    And the pattern detection agent identifies the coordinated nature
    When Alex and moderators from affected communities are alerted
    Then they can coordinate response while respecting local autonomy
    And each community handles the issue according to their standards
    And patterns are shared to protect other communities
    And the coordinated attack is neutralized through cooperation
