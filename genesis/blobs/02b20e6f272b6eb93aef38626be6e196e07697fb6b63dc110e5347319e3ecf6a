Scenario: Parent tracks afterschool program changes
    Given the parent relies on community afterschool program for childcare
    And works until 6 PM making program essential for family functioning
    When the community discusses cutting program hours or funding
    Then the parent receives immediate alert about the threat
    And sees which council members support vs oppose the cuts
    And connects with other parents dependent on the program
    And submits testimony explaining family economic impacts
    And childcare infrastructure doesn't disappear without parent input
