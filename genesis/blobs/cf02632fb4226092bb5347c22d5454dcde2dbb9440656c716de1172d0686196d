Scenario: Privacy control remains with Frank as autonomous adult
    Given Frank's care contribution and health data is being tracked
    And this information is sensitive and personal
    When Frank determines data sharing preferences
    Then he must have complete control over all his data
    And he should choose what's shared with family, organizations, or community
    And he can demonstrate care value to family if he wishes
    And he can maintain complete privacy if he prefers
    And health data sharing must be explicitly consented
    And volunteer coordination can share relevant information
    And Frank's autonomy over his information must be absolute
