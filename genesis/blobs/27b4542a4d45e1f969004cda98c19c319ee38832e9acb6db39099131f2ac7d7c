Scenario: Community members invest in preserving neighborhood institution
    Given neighbors value Rosa's Auto but have no ownership pathway
    And community members want to support local businesses beyond patronage
    When community investment pool enables neighborhood participation
    Then neighbors invest modest amounts ($2K-$10K) in acquisition financing
    And investors receive fair return (5% annually) plus social benefit
    And investment enables Rosa's dignified exit while protecting workers
    And community gains democratic governance voice in institution they supported
    And community_elohim manages investment relationships transparently
