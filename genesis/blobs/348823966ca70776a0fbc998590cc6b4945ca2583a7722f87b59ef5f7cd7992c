Scenario: Disability justice education transforms community culture
    Given Alex teaches community about disability justice frameworks
    And education shifts how community understands disability
    When Alex provides training, workshops, or consultation
    Then this educational labor should be valued as care work
    And the community_elohim should track Alex's teaching contributions
    And cultural transformation work should accumulate care tokens
    And Alex's expertise should be compensated appropriately
    And education that reduces ableism is high-value care work
    And the protocol should recognize teaching as care labor
    And Alex's intellectual contributions should be properly valued
