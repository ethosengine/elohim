Feature: Provincial/State-Level Appeal Process for Appellant
  As an appellant in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer
  I want appeals that establish regional constitutional precedent
  So that complex cases and novel situations get proper deliberation and create guidance

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the appellant user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active
    And Regional Constitutional Council handles escalated appeals and novel cases

  Scenario: Escalated appeal reaches Regional Constitutional Council
    Given my appeal couldn't be resolved at community layer
    And I escalated to peer agent review which affirmed the decision
    When I request Constitutional Council review at regional level
    Then randomly-selected citizens from across the region review my case
    And They include Sarah Martinez, a nurse serving her 3-month term
    And They deliberate for substantive time (2+ hours for complex cases)
    And They have access to technical experts to explain complex aspects
    And They create precedent that affects multiple communities in the region
    And I receive judgment within one month of reaching this layer
    And The decision includes detailed constitutional reasoning

  Scenario: Appeal establishes novel constitutional precedent
    Given my case involves a situation not previously addressed
    And existing precedents don't clearly apply to my circumstances
    When Regional Constitutional Council deliberates my case
    Then they engage deeply with constitutional principles
    And They consider multiple interpretations and their implications
    And They consult technical experts about what's technically possible
    And They examine similar cases from other regions for comparison
    And They create new precedent with careful reasoning
    And The precedent becomes part of public constitutional record
    And Future similar cases reference my appeal's constitutional interpretation

  Scenario: Appeal involves technical complexity requiring expert testimony
    Given my appeal concerns cryptographic verification of agent reasoning
    And I question whether the agent actually followed claimed constitutional principles
    When Technical Expert Dr. Amara Okonkwo testifies to the Constitutional Council
    Then she explains the cryptographic proof in accessible language
    And She clarifies what confidence levels mean and their limitations
    And She acknowledges uncertainties in the technical analysis
    And She presents competing interpretations when experts disagree
    And She informs but doesn't dictate the council's judgment
    And The council weighs technical information alongside human wisdom
    And I understand the technical basis of the decision through her explanation

  Scenario: Cross-community appeal requiring regional coordination
    Given my appeal involves agent decisions affecting multiple communities
    And communities have different local calibrations creating conflict
    When Regional Constitutional Council reviews the inter-community issue
    Then they evaluate how subsidiarity principle applies across communities
    And They examine if regional coordination is constitutionally required
    And They consider if local diversity should be preserved or harmonized
    And They may establish regional minimums while allowing local variation
    And They create precedent for how communities coordinate at scale
    And My appeal contributes to multi-layer governance coherence

  Scenario: Appeal reveals systematic bias across multiple communities
    Given similar appeals have been filed across many communities in the region
    And a pattern suggests systematic issue not isolated incidents
    When I file my appeal as part of this broader pattern
    Then Regional Constitutional Council treats this as systemic review
    And Researcher provides analysis of the appeal pattern data
    And They investigate if protocol implementation has regional bias
    And They examine if certain demographics are disproportionately affected
    And They may order regional protocol audit or recalibration
    And My individual appeal becomes part of systemic justice work
    And Constitutional accountability operates at scale not just individual cases

  Scenario: Appeal involving cultural specificity vs constitutional minimums
    Given my community has cultural practices that differ from regional norms
    And an agent decision applied regional default rather than local calibration
    When I appeal based on cultural context
    Then Regional Constitutional Council evaluates legitimate cultural diversity
    And They distinguish between cultural variation and constitutional violations
    And They examine if my community had ability to calibrate protocol appropriately
    And They consider if agent should have recognized cultural context
    And They balance universal human dignity with cultural specificity
    And The precedent clarifies how constitutional minimums apply across cultures
    And My appeal protects cultural diversity within constitutional framework

  Scenario: Appeal outcome influences provincial policy making
    Given my appeal revealed gap between agent governance and state law
    And Constitutional Council recommendations identify needed legal changes
    When Senator Ruiz reviews appeal precedents for policy insights
    Then she uses my case as evidence in legislative hearings
    And She crafts legislation addressing the constitutional gap
    And She cites the council's reasoning in justifying policy changes
    And My individual appeal contributes to democratic policy improvement
    And Constitutional governance and representative democracy work together
    And Policy makers learn from Constitutional Council wisdom

  Scenario: Appeal with significant regional impact gets extensive deliberation
    Given my case could affect thousands of families across the region
    And the constitutional question has major implications
    When Regional Constitutional Council reviews my high-stakes appeal
    Then they allocate substantial time (multiple sessions over weeks)
    And They invite testimony from diverse community leaders
    And They consult with technical experts on implementation implications
    And They examine long-term consequences of different interpretations
    And They consider dissenting views and minority perspectives
    And They produce comprehensive written opinion with reasoning
    And The thorough deliberation legitimates the significant precedent they create

  Scenario: Dissenting opinion preserved in regional precedent
    Given Regional Constitutional Council deliberates my appeal
    And the council reaches majority decision but some members disagree
    When the precedent is documented
    Then dissenting opinions are included with their reasoning
    And The dissent explains alternative constitutional interpretation
    And Future councils can reference both majority and dissent
    And Constitutional evolution can draw on minority wisdom later
    And My appeal generates rich constitutional dialogue not just single answer
    And Disagreement is honored as part of democratic deliberation

  Scenario: Appeal precedent cited in research on democratic AI governance
    Given my appeal created important regional precedent
    And Dr. James Chen is researching constitutional council effectiveness
    When he analyzes appeal patterns and outcomes
    Then my case (anonymized) becomes research data
    And The precedent illustrates how sortition governance works
    And Research findings feed back into protocol improvement
    And My appeal contributes to global understanding of democratic AI governance
    And Individual justice and systemic learning happen together

  Scenario: Rapid appeal review during regional crisis
    Given a regional crisis requires many urgent agent decisions
    And I need to appeal a crisis-related decision quickly
    When Regional Constitutional Council convenes emergency session
    Then they balance speed with deliberation quality
    And They evaluate if emergency protocols were properly invoked
    And They examine if crisis urgency justified departures from normal process
    And They provide expedited review (48-72 hours) while maintaining rigor
    And They create precedent for crisis governance
    And My appeal ensures democratic accountability even under emergency conditions
