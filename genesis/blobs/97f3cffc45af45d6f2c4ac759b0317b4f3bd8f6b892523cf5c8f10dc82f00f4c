Scenario: Activist coordinates rapid response across network
    Given Indigenous land defenders face immediate threat of eviction
    And the situation requires urgent solidarity action
    When the land defenders' community issues call for support
    And the call is verified through network trust relationships
    Then rapid response protocol activates across affinity network
    And each community determines its capacity to respond
    And coordination happens in real-time across time zones
    And actions are culturally appropriate and locally determined
    And the network mobilizes pressure while preventing burnout
    And the land defenders receive coordinated solidarity support
