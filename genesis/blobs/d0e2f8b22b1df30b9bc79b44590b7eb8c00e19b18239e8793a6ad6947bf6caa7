Scenario: Coordinating between nuclear and extended family boundaries
    Given Sarah's household has its own governance
    And extended family has legitimate interests in children
    When boundaries between household and extended family are negotiated
    Then the family_elohim should help navigate appropriate boundaries
    And it should support Sarah's household autonomy
    And it should also recognize extended family relationships
    And boundary negotiations should be care-informed
    And the system should prevent both isolation and intrusion
    And healthy multigenerational boundaries should be maintained
