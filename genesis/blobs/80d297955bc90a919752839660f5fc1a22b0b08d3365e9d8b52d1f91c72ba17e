Scenario: Contributing skills to neighborhood when available
    Given I have food preparation skills from my restaurant work
    And neighbors might benefit from these skills
    When I have rare free time
    Then the protocol should help me share skills with neighborhood
    And coordinate skill-sharing or teaching opportunities
    And accumulate care tokens for skill contribution
    And build neighborhood capacity through skill distribution
