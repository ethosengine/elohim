Scenario: Identifying patterns in appeals informing local policy
    Given Constitutional Council has reviewed many Riverside appeals
    And I observe recurring themes and tensions
    When I analyze patterns for community improvement
    Then I see: many adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging
    And I notice: recurring privacy threshold concerns
    And I identify: business loan criteria creating frustration
    And I bring: patterns to city council for policy response
    And we consider: community-specific protocol calibration
    And we propose: local ordinance updates if needed
    And appeals inform: democratic policy making
    And feedback loop: connects individual recourse to systemic improvement
