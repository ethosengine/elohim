Scenario: Aging in place supported by neighborhood care infrastructure
    Given Frank plans to age in his neighborhood
    And neighborhoods can support aging in place through care economy
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates aging support
    Then it should connect Frank to neighbors who can provide future support
    And facilitate reciprocal care arrangements as needs change
    And coordinate check-ins and assistance for aging residents
    And Frank's current contributions should create future neighborhood support
    And care reciprocity should operate at neighborhood scale
    And aging in place should be supported through neighborhood care economy
    And Frank should experience security in continuing neighborhood membership
