Scenario: Owner preserves legacy through democratic conversion
    Given Rosa built community institution over 15 years
    And selling to corporate chain would destroy what she created
    When Rosa chooses EAE conversion over extractive sale
    Then her legacy becomes democratic institution serving neighborhood
    And her trust relationships are institutionalized, not erased
    And she becomes founder who chose community over individual wealth
    And legacy is preserved beyond her personal involvement
    And community honors her wisdom in transition choice
