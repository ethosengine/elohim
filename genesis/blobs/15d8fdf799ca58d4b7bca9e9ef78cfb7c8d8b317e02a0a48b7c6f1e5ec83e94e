Scenario: Municipal sustainability and care economy integration
    Given care economy and ecological sustainability are connected
    And Robert's care practices affect environmental sustainability
    And municipal sustainability policy should include care economy
    When municipal_elohim connects care and sustainability
    Then it should help Robert see connections between care economy and ecological sustainability
    And support advocacy for municipal policy that integrates both
    And recognize that care for people and care for planet are linked
    And build municipal sustainability that includes care economy principles
    And demonstrate that sustainable communities require care economy
    And create municipalities that support both human and ecological flourishing
    And recognize that his generation can integrate these priorities
