Scenario: Activist demands equitable school funding formula
    Given state funding formula creates massive district disparities
    And the activist works on statewide education justice
    When the Observer calculates funding gaps and impacts
    Then the activist shows low-income districts receive $3000 less per student
    And demonstrates impact on class sizes and programs
    And connects families in underfunded districts statewide
    And builds coalition for funding formula reform
    And structural inequity becomes focus of political campaign
