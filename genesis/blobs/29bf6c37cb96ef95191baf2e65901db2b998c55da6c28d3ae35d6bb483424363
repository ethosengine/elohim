Scenario: Community care coordination across multiple service providers
    Given Helen receives support from multiple sources
    And coordination prevents gaps and duplication
    When the community_elohim tracks Helen's care network
    Then it should coordinate home health aides, medical providers, and volunteers
    And it should identify gaps before they become crises
    And it should prevent duplication of services
    And it should ensure Helen's preferences are communicated across providers
    And care should happen around Helen, not to her
    And the protocol should provide infrastructure for complex care coordination
    And Helen should be center of coordinated care web
