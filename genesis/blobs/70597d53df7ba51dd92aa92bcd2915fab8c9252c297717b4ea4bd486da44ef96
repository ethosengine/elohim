Scenario: Teacher decodes school board agenda in morning brief
    Given tonight's board meeting will vote on "instructional efficiency optimization"
    And teachers have limited time to track board activities
    When the teacher receives Observer morning brief
    Then they learn this means increasing class sizes from 24 to 28
    And see projected impact on teaching and individual attention
    And get concrete advocacy pathway (testimony, email, coordination)
    And can coordinate response with colleagues and parents during workday
    And board jargon becomes actionable intelligence
