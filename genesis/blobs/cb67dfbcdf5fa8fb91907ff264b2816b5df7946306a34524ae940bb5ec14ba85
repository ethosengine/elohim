Scenario: Family boundary management as care recipient's family intrudes
    Given David's parents have opinions about his care
    And they may question James's decisions
    When family boundaries are negotiated
    Then the family_elohim should support James's care authority
    And it should recognize him as primary caregiver and spouse
    And it should help James maintain appropriate boundaries
    And David's family should provide support, not interference
    And family governance should respect caregiving relationship
    And boundaries should be clear when family dynamics become difficult
