Scenario: Personal agency maintained even when needing support
    Given Alex requires assistance with some aspects of life
    And society often conflates needing help with lacking agency
    When Alex makes decisions about their life
    Then needing support should not diminish Alex's autonomy
    And the system should separate assistance from authority
    And Alex should maintain full decision-making power
    And support should flow to Alex's direction, not override it
    And interdependence should be recognized as human reality
    And Alex's agency should be protected even when vulnerable
    And the protocol should embody disability rights principle: "Nothing about us without us"
