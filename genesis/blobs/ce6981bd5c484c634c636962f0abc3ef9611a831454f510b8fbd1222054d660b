Scenario: Climate adaptation strategies are developed and shared bioregionally
    Given climate change creates new agricultural challenges (droughts, floods, heat, pests)
    And adaptation requires experimentation and knowledge sharing
    When democratic farms collaborate on climate adaptation
    Then drought-resistant varieties are tested and shared across network
    And water conservation practices spread through successful demonstration
    And extreme weather response strategies are coordinated bioregionally
    And climate resilience increases through collaborative adaptation
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates climate adaptation research and implementation
