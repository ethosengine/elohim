Scenario: Politician distinguishes industry fear-mongering from legitimate economic concerns
    Given industry lobbyists claim environmental regulation will destroy jobs
    And present catastrophic economic projections
    When the Observer fact-checks industry claims with evidence
    Then they see similar regulations in comparable jurisdictions
    And review actual employment impacts versus predicted job losses
    And identify compliance costs versus health and environmental benefits
    And understand which industries adapted successfully to regulations
    And resist manipulation through evidence-based economic analysis
