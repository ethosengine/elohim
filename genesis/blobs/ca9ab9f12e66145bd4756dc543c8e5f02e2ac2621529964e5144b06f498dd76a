Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Senior
  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want to coordinate household care economy and resource management
  So that retirement household patterns support both care contributions and personal well-being

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the senior user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret manages a retirement household
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim is coordinating household care economy
    And Margaret's household income is $32k/year fixed

  Scenario: Household budget management on fixed retirement income
    Given Margaret's household has fixed income of $32k/year
    And income cannot be increased through additional employment
    When the household_elohim manages resource allocation
    Then it should track all household expenses and patterns
    And it should optimize spending across categories
    And it should identify opportunities for cost reduction
    And it should help Margaret maintain quality of life within constraints
    And the $150/week grocery budget should be managed carefully
    And household financial dignity should be preserved
    And the framing should be resource optimization, not poverty

  Scenario: Coordinating household care economy with spouse
    Given Margaret shares household with a spouse
    And both are retired and contributing care labor
    When the household_elohim tracks care contributions
    Then it should recognize both partners' care work
    And it should help distribute household labor equitably
    And it should track who does what to prevent invisible labor
    And it should facilitate conversations about fair distribution
    And both partners should experience valued contributions
    And equity should be maintained in retirement partnership

  Scenario: Managing household independently as single senior
    Given Margaret lives alone in her household
    And she manages all household responsibilities independently
    When Margaret coordinates household tasks
    Then her personal_agent should support her independence
    And all household labor should be visible and valued
    And the system should help her maintain self-sufficiency
    And she should feel capable, not isolated
    And household management should feel manageable
    And her autonomy should be preserved and celebrated

  Scenario: Meal planning for changing nutritional needs and budget
    Given Margaret has dietary requirements for diabetes management
    And she needs to optimize nutrition within $150/week budget
    When the household_elohim helps plan meals
    Then it should balance health needs with budget constraints
    And it should suggest affordable high-protein, high-calcium options
    And it should plan for one or two people to minimize waste
    And it should use Margaret's cooking knowledge and preferences
    And meals should be nutritious, affordable, and satisfying
    And food should support health without breaking budget

  Scenario: Household resource sharing to extend budget
    Given Margaret's fixed income requires resource optimization
    And household expenses can be reduced through sharing
    When the household_elohim identifies sharing opportunities
    Then it should connect Margaret to tool libraries
    And it should facilitate bulk buying cooperatives
    And it should suggest neighborhood resource sharing
    And it should help reduce household costs through community
    And Margaret's budget should stretch further through cooperation
    And resource sharing should feel like community, not charity

  Scenario: Balancing care contributions with household needs
    Given Margaret provides extensive care outside her household
    And household tasks still require attention
    When the household_elohim monitors Margaret's overall care burden
    Then it should track time spent on external care commitments
    And it should ensure household needs aren't neglected
    And it should flag if Margaret's care burden becomes overwhelming
    And it should suggest balance between giving and self-care
    And Margaret's own household should remain a priority
    And burnout prevention should be built into system

  Scenario: Household downsizing and simplification support
    Given Margaret is transitioning to retirement household patterns
    And she may need to simplify or downsize
    When Margaret considers household changes
    Then the household_elohim should provide decision support
    And it should help evaluate different living arrangements
    And it should calculate cost implications of changes
    And it should preserve Margaret's autonomy in decisions
    And practical information should support her choices
    And the system should help her age in place if she wishes

  Scenario: Household energy and utility cost management
    Given utilities represent significant portion of fixed income
    And cost reduction matters for household sustainability
    When the household_elohim tracks utility usage
    Then it should help Margaret optimize energy use
    And it should suggest cost-saving behavioral changes
    And it should identify assistance programs available to seniors
    And utility costs should be minimized without sacrificing comfort
    And Margaret's household should be sustainable on fixed income
    And dignity should be maintained in resource management

  Scenario: Coordinating household care with external family obligations
    Given Margaret provides care for grandchildren at her home sometimes
    And her mother may visit or require household accommodation
    When the household_elohim coordinates multi-generational care
    Then it should help Margaret prepare household for care provision
    And it should track supplies needed for grandchild visits
    And it should plan for mother's accessibility needs
    And household resources should flex for care obligations
    And Margaret's home should support her care contributions
    And the household should be center of care economy activity

  Scenario: Household safety modifications for aging in place
    Given Margaret wants to continue living independently
    And aging may require household modifications
    When the household_elohim assesses safety needs
    Then it should identify potential safety hazards
    And it should suggest affordable modifications
    And it should connect Margaret to assistance programs
    And modifications should support long-term independence
    And Margaret should be able to age safely at home
    And proactive planning should prevent crisis

  Scenario: Seasonal household adjustments for health and budget
    Given Margaret's health needs change with seasons
    And seasonal weather affects household costs
    When the household_elohim plans for seasonal transitions
    Then it should help Margaret prepare for winter heating costs
    And it should suggest summer cooling strategies on budget
    And it should adjust meal planning for seasonal produce
    And household should be optimized for each season
    And Margaret should maintain comfort year-round
    And seasonal planning should prevent budget crises

  Scenario: Maintaining household dignity and quality despite constraints
    Given Margaret's household operates on limited resources
    And she has decades of experience making homes
    When the household_elohim supports Margaret's household management
    Then it should honor her expertise and knowledge
    And it should help her maintain the home she wants
    And it should preserve household dignity and beauty
    And financial constraints should not mean deprivation
    And Margaret's household should reflect her values and taste
    And quality of life should be supported within resource limits
