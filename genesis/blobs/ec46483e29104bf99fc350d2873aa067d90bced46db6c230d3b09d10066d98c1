Scenario: Integrating municipal services with protocol coordination
    Given city provides services (water, waste, transit, parks)
    And these need coordination with protocol resource flows
    When I integrate municipal services with Elohim coordination
    Then city departments: share data with agents appropriately
    And Municipal Elohim: helps optimize service delivery
    And environmental services: coordinate with Ecosystem Elohim
    And social services: work with Community Elohim for crisis response
    And integration respects: department professional judgment
    And agents augment: not replace city workers
    And public services improve: through better coordination
