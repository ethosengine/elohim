Scenario: Farm supports community food sovereignty and cultural food preservation
    Given corporate food system homogenizes diets and erases cultural food traditions
    And immigrant and indigenous communities lose access to traditional foods
    When democratic farm responds to community cultural food needs
    Then farm grows culturally specific crops (Latino vegetables, Asian greens, indigenous varieties)
    And traditional food knowledge is valued and incorporated into farm planning
    And community food sovereignty increases through local diverse production
    And cultural food preservation becomes farm mission alongside nutrition
    And community_elohim documents and supports cultural food sovereignty initiatives
