Scenario: Learning from financial mistakes with safety nets
    Given Jasmine overspent her monthly budget by $40
    And she used her college savings to cover the shortfall
    When her personal_agent analyzes the situation
    Then it should provide non-judgmental feedback about the pattern
    And help her understand the long-term impact on her college savings goal
    And support her learning from the mistake
    And suggest strategies for getting back on track
    And not shame or guilt her about the decision
    And recognize that learning requires room for mistakes
    And ensure the mistake isn't catastrophic to her future
