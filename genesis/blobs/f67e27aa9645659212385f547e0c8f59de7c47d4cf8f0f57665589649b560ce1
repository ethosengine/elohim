Scenario: Board member receives independent analysis of staff budget recommendation
    Given district superintendent recommends budget with significant program cuts
    And 200-page budget packet emphasizes efficiency and fiscal responsibility
    And board meeting is in 3 days with vote expected
    When the board member requests Observer independent analysis
    Then they receive concise summary identifying key trade-offs staff minimized
    And see comparison of per-student spending across district schools showing disparities
    And access data on community impacts of proposed cuts by demographic group
    And get examples of how similar districts managed budget challenges differently
    And independent analysis reveals information asymmetry in staff presentation
