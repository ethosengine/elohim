Scenario: Household maintenance with no partner to share repairs and tasks
    Given Maria handles all household repairs, maintenance, and problem-solving alone
    And she has limited time, money, and often limited technical knowledge
    When household maintenance needs arise
    Then the household_elohim should provide decision support for repairs
    And it should help her evaluate DIY versus hiring professionals
    And it should connect her to affordable service providers when needed
    And it should coordinate with neighbors for skill-sharing and tool-borrowing
    And Maria should have support for household maintenance without a partner
