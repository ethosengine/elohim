Scenario: Protect appellant rights as universal constitutional minimum
    Given authoritarian government attempts to suppress appeals
    And the government wants agents to operate without oversight
    When global Constitutional Council evaluates the attempt
    Then the council reaffirms appeal rights as universal minimum
    And the council declares that human dignity requires recourse
    And no jurisdiction can eliminate appellant rights while claiming protocol alignment
    And international community recognizes council authority
    And appellants worldwide are protected by global constitutional floor
