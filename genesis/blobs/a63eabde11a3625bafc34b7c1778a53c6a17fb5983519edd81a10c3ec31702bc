Scenario: Household routines maintained for cognitive support
    Given Helen's dementia makes routine important for functioning
    And familiar patterns help her maintain independence
    When the household_elohim supports daily routines
    Then her established patterns should be preserved
    And reminders should support her existing habits
    And changes should be minimized to reduce confusion
    And her personal_agent should say "Time for your morning tea, like always"
    And routine should provide cognitive scaffolding
    And household familiarity should support her capability
    And the protocol should recognize that routine enables autonomy
