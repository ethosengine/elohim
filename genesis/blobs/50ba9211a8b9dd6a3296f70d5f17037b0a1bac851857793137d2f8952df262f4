Scenario: Accessible interface design respects aging-related needs
    Given Margaret is using the Value Scanner
    And she has age-related vision and dexterity changes
    When Margaret opens the scanner application
    Then the interface should display large, high-contrast fonts
    And touch targets should be large and forgiving
    And voice interface options should be available
    And navigation should be simple and consistent
    And no time-limited interactions should be required
    And the pace should be patient without being patronizing
    And the interface should feel respectful and empowering
    And cognitive load should be minimized
