Scenario: Advanced care planning supported early and comprehensively
    Given David's condition is progressive and will worsen
    And advance directives are essential before capability is lost
    When the healthcare_elohim facilitates care planning
    Then it should prompt advance directive discussions early
    And it should help James and David document wishes
    And it should ensure legal documents are comprehensive
    And it should coordinate care planning across providers
    And future care should be planned while David can still participate
