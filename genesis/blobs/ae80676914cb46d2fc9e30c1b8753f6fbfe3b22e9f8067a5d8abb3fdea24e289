Given multiple neighborhoods face similar housing challenges
And the activist has credibility in their own neighborhood
When they reach out to activists in adjacent neighborhoods
And they propose forming a district-level coalition
Then cross-neighborhood connections are negotiated through mutual trust
And a district-layer organizing space is created
And patterns from successful housing campaigns surface as resources
And the coalition coordinates action while respecting local autonomy
And each neighborhood maintains its own decision-making process
