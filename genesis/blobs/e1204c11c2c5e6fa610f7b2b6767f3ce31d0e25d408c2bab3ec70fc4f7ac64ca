Scenario: Elder knowledge of historical building techniques and materials
    Given Frank has decades of construction experience
    And traditional building techniques are often more sustainable
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates building knowledge
    Then it should value Frank's knowledge of traditional techniques
    And facilitate teaching historical building methods
    And recognize that older practices may be more ecological
    And connect past building wisdom to contemporary sustainability
    And Frank's experience should inform bioregional building culture
    And elder knowledge should guide sustainable building revival
