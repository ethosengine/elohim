Scenario: Family memory preservation through elderly storytelling
    Given Helen holds decades of family history
    And dementia threatens loss of collective memory
    When Helen shares family stories
    Then the family_elohim should help capture and preserve these memories
    And Helen's storytelling should be recognized as valuable contribution
    And great-grandchildren should learn family history from Helen
    And her role as family memory keeper should be honored
    And preservation should happen while she can still share
    And the protocol should recognize cultural value of elder wisdom
    And family heritage should be maintained through elder participation
