Scenario: Sustainable consumption choices tracked as environmental care work
    Given Jasmine preferentially chooses sustainable products
    And she has bought local/seasonal/sustainable products in 12 of 15 purchases
    When bioregional_elohim analyzes her consumption patterns
    Then it should recognize her environmental care contributions
    And track her choices as care work for ecosystem health
    And calculate environmental impact reduction from her choices
    And value bioregional stewardship in care token allocation
    And demonstrate that ecological care creates economic value
    And recognize environmental activism as legitimate care labor
