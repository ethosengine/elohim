Scenario: Appealing community resource allocation decision
    Given Community Elohim denied my small business loan application
    And I believe the criteria were unfairly applied
    When I appeal the economic decision
    Then Community Constitutional Council reviews the resource allocation
    And They evaluate if constitutional principles of care and equity were followed
    And They examine if I had meaningful opportunity to present my case
    And They consider community economic context and priorities
    And They assess if the agent's risk analysis was sound or biased
    And The appeal can result in decision reversal or modified evaluation criteria
    And Local economic priorities are clarified through appeal precedents
