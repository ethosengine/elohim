Scenario: Legacy and intergenerational responsibility for bioregional health
    Given Robert's generation has substantially affected bioregional ecology
    And his choices affect ecological inheritance for grandchildren
    And intergenerational responsibility requires ecological repair and protection
    When bioregional_elohim supports legacy planning
    Then it should help Robert understand his generation's ecological impact
    And recognize responsibility to repair damage and protect bioregional health
    And surface opportunities for ecological restoration participation
    And support him in building positive ecological legacy
    And connect ecological stewardship to care for grandchildren's future
    And demonstrate that care economy includes intergenerational ecological responsibility
    And build commitment to bioregional health as care for future generations
