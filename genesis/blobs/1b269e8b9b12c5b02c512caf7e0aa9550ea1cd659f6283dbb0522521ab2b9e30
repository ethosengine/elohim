Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Parent
  As a parent coordinating care across multiple generations
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want multigenerational care relationships to be visible and reciprocal
  So that family care economy flows equitably across generations

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah's family includes her children Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And Sarah's extended family includes her parents and siblings
    And Sarah's partner's parents are also involved
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy
    And care flows in multiple directions across generations

  Scenario: Parent's care work visible across extended family
    Given Sarah provides care to her children and aging parents
    And she coordinates between generations
    When the family_elohim tracks Sarah's care contributions
    Then her work should be visible to entire extended family
    And grandparents should see Sarah's parenting labor
    And siblings should see her coordination work
    And the full family should recognize her care contributions
    And visibility should enable family-wide appreciation
    And Sarah's labor should be valued across all family relationships

  Scenario: Grandparents' childcare contributions recognized and valued
    Given Sarah's parents provide regular childcare
    And they help with Tommy and Emma multiple times weekly
    When the family_elohim tracks grandparent care
    Then their contributions should be quantified and valued
    And they should accumulate care tokens for their labor
    And their work should be recognized as essential family support
    And grandparents should not be taken for granted
    And multigenerational care should be reciprocal, not extractive
    And the system should make grandparent labor visible and valued

  Scenario: Sarah's support for aging parents made visible
    Given Sarah's parents are aging and need increasing support
    And Sarah helps with medical appointments, financial planning, household tasks
    When the family_elohim tracks Sarah's elder care
    Then it should recognize this as substantial care labor
    And it should show Sarah is simultaneously caring up and down generations
    And elder care should accumulate care tokens
    And the family should see Sarah's sandwich generation burden
    And her care for aging parents should be valued alongside childcare
    And multigenerational care should be comprehensive and visible

  Scenario: Family care economy coordinates reciprocity across generations
    Given Sarah receives childcare support from grandparents
    And Sarah provides elder care to her aging parents
    When the family_elohim analyzes care flows
    Then it should show reciprocal care patterns
    And it should ensure care is not unidirectionally extractive
    And it should coordinate so care flows equitably
    And family relationships should be based on mutual support
    And the system should enable sustainable multigenerational care
    And care economy should prevent family exploitation

  Scenario: Teaching children family care economy principles
    Given Sarah is raising Tommy and Emma in care economy framework
    And she wants them to understand family care relationships
    When Sarah teaches children about family care
    Then the family_elohim should support value literacy education
    And children should learn that grandparents' help is valuable work
    And they should understand that Sarah cares for her parents too
    And they should see care as reciprocal across generations
    And the next generation should internalize care economy principles
    And family culture should be transformed through children's education

  Scenario: Family resource allocation based on care contributions
    Given Sarah contributes enormous care labor to family
    And family resources are finite
    When the family makes resource allocation decisions
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her standing
    And her care tokens should influence family governance
    And those who do care work should have voice in resource decisions
    And family economics should reflect care economy principles
    And Sarah should not be economically dependent despite unpaid care work
    And the system should enable care-based family governance

  Scenario: Coordinating between nuclear and extended family boundaries
    Given Sarah's household has its own governance
    And extended family has legitimate interests in children
    When boundaries between household and extended family are negotiated
    Then the family_elohim should help navigate appropriate boundaries
    And it should support Sarah's household autonomy
    And it should also recognize extended family relationships
    And boundary negotiations should be care-informed
    And the system should prevent both isolation and intrusion
    And healthy multigenerational boundaries should be maintained

  Scenario: Family cultural values transmitted through care practices
    Given Sarah's family has specific cultural traditions
    And she wants children to learn their cultural heritage
    When Sarah practices culturally-specific care
    Then the family_elohim should recognize cultural value transmission
    And it should support culturally-appropriate care practices
    And it should value the work of maintaining cultural identity
    And cultural education should be recognized as care labor
    And diverse family cultures should be respected and supported
    And care economy should serve families' chosen cultural frameworks

  Scenario: Sibling relationships and care coordination
    Given Sarah's siblings also have care responsibilities
    And they coordinate care for aging parents
    When the family_elohim tracks sibling care contributions
    Then it should show who is doing what for parents
    And it should prevent care labor from falling unequally on one sibling
    And it should enable equitable distribution of elder care
    And sibling relationships should be based on fair care sharing
    And the system should prevent family dynamics where one child does everything
    And care economy should create accountability among siblings

  Scenario: Family care during crisis and exceptional needs
    Given family members sometimes have crisis needs
    And Sarah might need to care for sick parent or struggling sibling
    When family crisis occurs
    Then the family_elohim should coordinate emergency care response
    And it should show who has capacity to help
    And it should recognize crisis care as extraordinary contribution
    And temporary intensive care should be specially valued
    And the system should enable family mutual aid during crisis
    And care economy should support family resilience

  Scenario: Blended family and step-family care recognition
    Given many families include step-parents and half-siblings
    And Sarah may have step-family relationships
    When the family_elohim tracks blended family care
    Then it should recognize care across non-biological relationships
    And step-parent care should be valued equally
    And half-sibling care should be recognized
    And diverse family structures should be fully supported
    And care economy should serve all family configurations
    And the system should not privilege nuclear biological family

  Scenario: Family care legacy and intergenerational learning
    Given Sarah learned caregiving from her own parents
    And she is teaching care practices to Tommy and Emma
    When the family_elohim tracks intergenerational patterns
    Then it should recognize care legacy across generations
    And it should show how care practices are transmitted
    And it should value Sarah's role in teaching next generation
    And intergenerational care knowledge should be recognized
    And the system should support positive care culture transmission
    And family care economy should build across generations
