Scenario: Privacy and consent in community data sharing
    Given community coordination requires some information sharing
    And Kenji has full privacy rights
    When the community_elohim manages community information
    Then Kenji must control what community data is shared
    And his participation should be visible only with his consent
    And community care should not require surveillance
    And privacy should be protected while enabling coordination
    And the system should balance community connection with individual privacy
    And Kenji should participate in community on his own terms
