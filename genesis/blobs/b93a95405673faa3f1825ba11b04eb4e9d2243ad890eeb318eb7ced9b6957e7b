Scenario: Alternative educational pathways honor real-world capability
    Given Marcus has demonstrated sophisticated stewardship
    And traditional school may not capture his capabilities
    When educational pathways are considered
    Then alternative credentials should recognize his applied skills
    And competency-based advancement should be available
    And his household management should qualify for advanced placement
    And educational system should honor multiple forms of intelligence
    And practical capability should open doors to opportunity
    And care economy should create pathways beyond traditional academics
