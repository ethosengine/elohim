Scenario: Community education and skill-sharing workshops
    Given Margaret has skills accumulated over lifetime
    And community members could benefit from her knowledge
    When the educational_elohim coordinates community education
    Then Margaret should be able to teach workshops
    And her teaching labor should be tracked as care contribution
    And skills like cooking, budgeting, health literacy should be shared
    And community capacity should grow through senior teaching
    And Margaret's knowledge should strengthen community resilience
    And teaching should be recognized as valuable community service
