Scenario: Studying national Constitutional Convention as deliberative democracy
    Given National Constitutional Convention convenes with randomly-selected citizens
    And this is largest deliberative democracy experiment in history
    When I study the convention process and outcomes
    Then I examine: how 10,000 citizens deliberate on existential questions
    And I analyze: what enables productive vs polarizing disagreement
    And I assess: quality of deliberation at unprecedented scale
    And I explore: how amendments emerge from collective wisdom
    And I track: influence of diverse perspectives vs expert domination
    And I investigate: whether citizens can make wise choices under deep uncertainty
    And My research tests: limits and possibilities of democratic capacity
