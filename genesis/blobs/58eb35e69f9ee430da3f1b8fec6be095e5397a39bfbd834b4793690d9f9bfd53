Scenario: Activist coordinates statewide organizing campaign
    Given housing justice activists across 15 cities face same state policy barrier
    And coordination is exhausting without infrastructure
    When the Observer facilitates statewide activist network
    Then activists can share tactics and research
    And coordinate testimony across multiple legislative hearings
    And track campaign progress and legislator commitments
    And distributed organizing becomes coordinated movement
    And state-level power builds through network effects
