Scenario: Politician builds coalition for education funding increase
    Given the politician champions education investment
    And needs public support for tax increase
    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities
    Then they see parents across political spectrum support smaller class sizes
    And identify business community concern about workforce preparation
    And connect with educators who can explain funding impacts
    And facilitate coalition across traditional political divides
    And build broad-based campaign for education investment
