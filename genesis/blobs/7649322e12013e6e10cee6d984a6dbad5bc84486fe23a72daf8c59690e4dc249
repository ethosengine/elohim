Scenario: Neighborhood care exchange coordinates mutual support
    Given Robert has skills and resources to share
    And he also needs support managing his care demands
    And neighbors have complementary needs and capacities
    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates care exchange
    Then it should match Robert's capacities with neighborhood needs
    And connect him to neighbors who can provide support
    And recognize his contributions: lawn care help for elderly neighbor, professional mentoring
    And surface opportunities: "Maria can provide backup childcare when your grandchild visits"
    And build reciprocal relationships based on mutual care
    And demonstrate that neighborhood functions through care exchange
    And strengthen local social capital
