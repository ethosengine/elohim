Scenario: Activist prevents infiltration attempt
    Given the housing justice space has 50 active community members
    When a new member joins and immediately tries to promote violent tactics
    And they create multiple inflammatory contributions
    Then the earned reach system prevents wide distribution
    And the community_moderator is alerted to potential infiltration
    And existing members see community trust analysis
    And the space can collectively decide on appropriate response
    And the protection agent documents the incident for pattern recognition
    And organizing continues safely without disruption
