Scenario: National longitudinal study tracking 10-year outcomes
    Given Elohim Protocol has been adopted nationally for a decade
    And I am conducting comprehensive longitudinal evaluation
    When I analyze decade-long trajectories across thousands of communities
    Then I measure: sustained vs transient effects on wellbeing
    And I track: whether initial trust gains persist or decay
    And I examine: how children growing up with protocol differ from previous generation
    And I analyze: whether protocol transforms civic culture over time
    And I investigate: institutional evolution and adaptation patterns
    And I assess: whether benefits compound or plateau over time
    And My research captures: transformative effects that short-term studies miss
