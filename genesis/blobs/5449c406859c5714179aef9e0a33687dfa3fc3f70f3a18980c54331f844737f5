Scenario: Acknowledging limits of technical solutions to political problems
    Given some delegates hope technology will solve governance challenges
    And I must clarify what technology can and cannot do
    When I testify about technical limits
    Then I explain: technology enables but doesn't replace democratic choice
    And I clarify: that AI cannot resolve fundamental values conflicts
    And I acknowledge: many governance problems are political not technical
    And I resist: techno-solutionism and engineering hubris
    And I honor: that democracy is about human judgment not optimization
    And I demonstrate: epistemic humility about technology's role
    And I serve: realistic understanding of technical possibilities
