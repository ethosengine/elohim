Scenario: Franchise operator mental health and wellbeing improves across converted locations
    Given franchise operation causes severe stress from dual extraction and moral injury
    And operators suffer isolation, anxiety, and health problems from franchise burden
    When conversions liberate operators from extraction trap
    Then operator mental health improves measurably (reduced anxiety, better sleep, lower stress)
    And peer support network among converted operators provides community
    And health outcomes are documented showing franchise model's human cost
    And sector awareness grows about franchise operation's psychological toll
    And industry_sector_elohim documents wellbeing improvements advocating for conversion support
