Scenario: Bioregional governance includes care economy participants
    Given Sarah participates actively in bioregional care economy
    And bioregional governance affects ecological health
    When bioregional policy decisions are made
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her voice
    And those who practice ecological care should influence ecological policy
    And bioregional governance should be informed by care economy data
    And care for land should create standing in land governance
    And ecological democracy should include care economy participants
