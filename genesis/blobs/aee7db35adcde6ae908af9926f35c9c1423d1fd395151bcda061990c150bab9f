Scenario: Resolving household care conflicts
    Given household care distribution may become imbalanced
    When conflicts arise about who is contributing fairly
    Then the protocol should provide objective contribution data
    And facilitate conversations about fairness and capacity
    And help us identify solutions that work for everyone
    And support negotiation toward sustainable arrangements
