Scenario: Supporting bioregional food security and resilience
    Given bioregions need resilient local food systems
    And my food preparation skills contribute to food security
    When I want to support bioregional food resilience
    Then the protocol should connect me to community food security initiatives
    And help me contribute skills to mutual aid food programs
    And recognize that local food systems support community and ecological resilience
    And build bioregional capacity for food sovereignty
