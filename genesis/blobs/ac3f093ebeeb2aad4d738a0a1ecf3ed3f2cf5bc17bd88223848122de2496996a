Scenario: Community leadership balanced with existing care demands
    Given Robert has capacity for community contribution
    And community leadership opportunities are abundant
    And he also carries substantial family and work responsibilities
    When community_elohim coordinates his community participation
    Then it should help him balance community leadership with other demands
    And prevent over-commitment that would overwhelm him
    And surface when community demands exceed healthy boundaries
    And support him in choosing leadership roles that match his capacity
    And recognize that sustainable participation requires limits
    And prevent community from exploiting his sense of responsibility
    And support meaningful contribution without burnout
