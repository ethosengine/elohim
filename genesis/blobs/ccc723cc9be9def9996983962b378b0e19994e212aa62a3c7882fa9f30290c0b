Scenario: Privacy boundaries negotiated as teen develops autonomy
    Given Jasmine has legitimate need for privacy from family
    And the family has legitimate need for coordination and safety
    When Jasmine configures privacy settings
    Then she should control what family data is shared about her
    And family-relevant information (schedule, household responsibilities) should be accessible to family_elohim
    And her personal information (friendships, private purchases, reflections) should be protected
    And privacy boundaries should be negotiable as she demonstrates capability
    And the system should support healthy family relationships that respect growing autonomy
    And Maya should not experience anxiety about granting Jasmine appropriate privacy
