Scenario: Council member understands constituent priorities across diverse neighborhoods
    Given the politician represents economically and ethnically diverse district
    And different communities have different needs
    When the Observer aggregates constituent sentiment
    Then they see working parents prioritize after-school programs
    And learn seniors need meal delivery and transit access
    And understand immigrant communities face language barriers in services
    And identify disabled residents struggle with accessibility
    And balance diverse constituent needs in policy positions
