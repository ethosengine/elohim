Scenario: Recognition of unpaid care labor builds self-worth
    Given Margaret's care contributions are substantial but unpaid
    And traditional economics labels her as "not working"
    When Margaret reviews her care contribution data
    Then she should see quantified value of her labor
    And she should understand her economic contribution is significant
    And she should experience herself as productive member of society
    And the narrative of retirement as obsolescence should be countered
    And Margaret should have data to assert her value
    And her dignity and self-worth should be affirmed
