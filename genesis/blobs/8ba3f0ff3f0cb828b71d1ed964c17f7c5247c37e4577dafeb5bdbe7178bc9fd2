Scenario: Building professional network and references despite isolation and crisis
    Given professional networking requires time, energy, and social capital I lack
    And I need professional connections for employment opportunities
    When I work to build professional network
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me identify low-barrier networking opportunities
    And suggests strategies for building professional connections despite constraints
    And helps me leverage existing relationships for professional support
    And validates that networking is harder during crisis and that's not my fault
    And connects me to professional networks for people in similar situations
    And my personal_agent identifies networking opportunities matching my capacity
    And recognizes networking efforts as valuable professional development
    And celebrates each professional connection built
