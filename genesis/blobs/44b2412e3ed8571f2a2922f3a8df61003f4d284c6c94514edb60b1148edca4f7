Scenario: Citizen discovers coalition around shared community concern
    Given 14 neighbors are concerned about playground safety
    And the citizen has reported the same concern
    When the Public Observer detects the alignment pattern
    Then the citizen receives an opt-in coalition notification
    And they can coordinate with other concerned residents
    And they see aggregated data on playground conditions
    And they can participate in coordinated advocacy
    And isolation becomes collective action
