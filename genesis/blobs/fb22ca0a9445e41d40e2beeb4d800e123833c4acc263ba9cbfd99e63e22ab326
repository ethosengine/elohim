Scenario: Bioregional construction material knowledge and sourcing
    Given Frank knows regional building materials and their properties
    And bioregional materials reduce transportation and support local economy
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates material knowledge
    Then it should help Frank teach about regional construction materials
    And facilitate use of bioregionally-appropriate building techniques
    And recognize his knowledge of local material properties
    And strengthen bioregional building culture and economy
    And connect construction practices to place-based sustainability
    And Frank's experience should inform bioregional building standards
