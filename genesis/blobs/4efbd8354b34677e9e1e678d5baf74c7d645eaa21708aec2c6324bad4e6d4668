Scenario: Deliberating on ecological standing constitutional amendment
    Given proposal to grant ecosystems legal personhood at scale
    And this challenges human-centered constitutional framework
    When we deliberate whether nature has standing in protocol governance
    Then we hear: indigenous perspectives on human-nature relationships
    And we consider: ecological science and planetary boundaries
    And we examine: practical implications for resource allocation
    And we grapple: with expanding moral circle beyond humanity
    And we discuss: what dignity means for non-human beings
    And we create: constitutional framework for planetary flourishing
    And we show: citizens can address civilizational questions with wisdom
