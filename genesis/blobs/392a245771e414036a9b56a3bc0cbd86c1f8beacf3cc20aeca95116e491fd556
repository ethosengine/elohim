Scenario: Politician surfaces teacher and parent priorities at scale
    Given the politician hears from organized advocacy groups
    But suspects classroom realities differ from political narratives
    When the Observer aggregates teacher and parent input
    Then they see teachers prioritize classroom resources and planning time
    And learn parents want smaller class sizes and mental health support
    And identify disconnect between political fights and family priorities
    And understand professional educator perspectives on policy proposals
    And align education policy with teaching and learning needs
