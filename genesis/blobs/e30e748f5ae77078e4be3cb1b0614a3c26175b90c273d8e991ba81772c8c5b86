Scenario: Family care boundaries prevent burnout and exploitation
    Given Robert carries substantial family care burden
    And family care can become exploitative even with good intentions
    When family_elohim monitors care burden
    Then it should flag when Robert's care contributions exceed sustainable levels
    And recognize if siblings are not contributing equitably
    And surface if parents' needs are overwhelming family capacity
    And prompt discussion when external support is needed
    And protect Robert from being expected to handle everything
    And support family in recognizing when professional care is appropriate
    And ensure family care operates on reciprocity, not exploitation
