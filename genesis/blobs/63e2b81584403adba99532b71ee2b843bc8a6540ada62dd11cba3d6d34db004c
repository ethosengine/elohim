Scenario: Building identity around care rather than consumption
    Given Tommy has made multiple care contributions over time
    And the system has recognized his caring actions
    When Tommy reflects on his scanner usage
    Then he should experience himself as a valued contributor
    And his identity should be forming around care for others
    And he should understand that invisible work is actually valuable
    And he should not be conditioned toward consumer identity
    And care economy principles should be internalized through experience
