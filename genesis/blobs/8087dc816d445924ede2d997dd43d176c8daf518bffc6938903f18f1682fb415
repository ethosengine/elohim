Scenario: Building care economy infrastructure at community scale
    Given Margaret has time and motivation to build new systems
    And care economy requires infrastructure development
    When the community_elohim coordinates care economy building
    Then Margaret should be identified as potential infrastructure builder
    And her generation could establish care economy as normal practice
    And seniors could be powerful advocates and practitioners
    And community care economy infrastructure should be senior-led
    And Margaret's cohort could transform how community operates
    And systemic change should be enabled through senior participation
