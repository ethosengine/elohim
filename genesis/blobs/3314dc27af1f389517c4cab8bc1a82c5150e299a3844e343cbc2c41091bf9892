Scenario: Presenting research at Global Constitutional Convention
    Given convention delegates need evidence to inform constitutional decisions
    And I am invited to present research on sortition effectiveness
    When I address 10,000 randomly-selected citizens from around the world
    Then I summarize: what research shows about democratic AI governance
    And I present: honestly about successes, failures, and uncertainties
    And I explain: the superintelligence governance legitimacy question
    And I acknowledge: the limits of my knowledge and research
    And I clarify: that delegates must make values choices research cannot resolve
    And I serve: democracy by informing not replacing citizen judgment
    And My scholarship demonstrates: how expertise serves rather than dominates democracy
