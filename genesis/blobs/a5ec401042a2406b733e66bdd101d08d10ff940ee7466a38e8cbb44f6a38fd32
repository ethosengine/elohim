Scenario: Nutrition management with safety net for critical thresholds
    Given Marcus is responsible for his and Keisha's nutrition
    And inadequate nutrition has serious consequences
    When Marcus makes food choices over time
    Then the personal_agent should track nutrition across meals and weeks
    And the system should watch for nutrition falling below safe levels
    And if nutrition drops below critical thresholds, adult intervention should be triggered
    And Marcus should be supported in meeting nutritional needs
    And the agent should proactively suggest nutritious affordable options
    And safety nets should protect without undermining autonomy
