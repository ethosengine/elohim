Scenario: Managing family expectations about my crisis recovery timeline
    Given family members have opinions about how quickly I should "get back on my feet"
    And my actual recovery is proceeding at appropriate pace for trauma
    When family pressure conflicts with my needs
    Then the family_elohim helps me resist family timeline pressure
    And provides language for explaining that recovery takes time
    And validates that my pace is appropriate for my circumstances
    And helps me set boundaries with family members who push too hard
    And connects me to information about normal trauma recovery
    And my personal_agent reminds me that my timeline is right for me
    And recognizes boundary-setting with family as emotional labor
    And supports my right to recover at my own pace
