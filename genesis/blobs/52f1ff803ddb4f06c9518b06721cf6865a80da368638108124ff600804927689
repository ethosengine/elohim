Scenario: Household resource allocation for grandparenting expenses
    Given grandparenting involves costs (activities, supplies, treats, transportation)
    And Margaret and Robert share household finances
    When the household budgets for grandparenting expenses
    Then the household_elohim should track all grandparenting costs
    And it should help budget for these as household expenses
    And it should distinguish between household costs and reimbursable family costs
    And both partners should agree on grandparenting spending
    And household resources should support care provision without strain
    And financial planning should include grandparenting expenses
