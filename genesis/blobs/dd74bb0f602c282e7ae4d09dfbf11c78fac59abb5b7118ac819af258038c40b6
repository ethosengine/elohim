Scenario: Preventing Sarah's overcommitment through community coordination
    Given Sarah is highly engaged in community
    And she tends to say yes to too many requests
    When community organizations ask Sarah to contribute
    Then the community_elohim should track her total commitments
    And it should warn Sarah when she's approaching overcommitment
    And it should help her maintain sustainable participation
    And community should benefit from Sarah's long-term engagement
    And burnout should be prevented through coordination
