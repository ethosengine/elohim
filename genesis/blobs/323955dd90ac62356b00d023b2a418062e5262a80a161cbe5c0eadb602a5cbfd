Scenario: Organizer develops worker leaders for city council testimony
    Given restaurant workers face wage theft and unsafe conditions
    And most have never engaged in civic advocacy
    When the organizer supports leadership development via Observer
    Then workers receive accessible data on wage theft patterns
    And get testimony framework they can personalize with their stories
    And see labor protection policies from other cities
    And practice addressing council member questions
    And workers become powerful advocates for their own interests
