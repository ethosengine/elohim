    Then all household technology should be accessible to Alex
    And the household_elohim should integrate with accessible smart home systems
    And Alex should be able to control environment through voice or other accessible means
    And technology should reduce barriers, not create them
    And universal design principles should guide all technology choices
    And Alex should have equal or better access than non-disabled people
    And technology should serve Alex's independence
