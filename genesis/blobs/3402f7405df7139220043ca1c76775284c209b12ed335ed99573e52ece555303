Scenario: Retired grandparent presence strengthens neighborhood resilience
    Given Margaret is home during weekdays when many neighbors work
    And her presence provides neighborhood stability and observation
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks resident engagement
    Then it should recognize Margaret's daytime presence as valuable
    And it should value retired residents' neighborhood stewardship
    And it should recognize she provides informal neighborhood watch
    And her availability strengthens neighborhood safety and connection
    And retired elders should be seen as neighborhood assets
    And presence and engagement should accumulate care tokens
    And neighborhood benefits from Margaret's availability
