Scenario: Journalist monitors multiple state agencies despite limited capacity
    Given the journalist covers state government
    And must track legislature, education department, environmental agency, and 8 others
    When the Observer monitors all state agencies and legislative committees
    Then the journalist reviews all consequential meetings and decisions
    And receives alerts for newsworthy developments
    And tracks legislation through committee process automatically
    And comprehensive state surveillance becomes sustainable
    And important policy changes don't escape coverage
