Scenario: Neighborhood as site for practicing civic participation
    Given Kenji is learning how democratic participation works
    And neighborhood is most accessible governance layer
    When Kenji participates in neighborhood meetings or decisions
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize civic participation as care work
    And it should accumulate care tokens for attending meetings, voting on issues
    And it should teach him that democracy requires participation labor
    And civic work should be valued as care economy contribution
    And the system should build habits of democratic participation
    And students should practice civic engagement at neighborhood scale
