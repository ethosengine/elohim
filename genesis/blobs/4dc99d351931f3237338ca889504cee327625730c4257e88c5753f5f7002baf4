Scenario: State legislator tracks accountability for legislative commitments
    Given the politician co-sponsored criminal justice reform bill
    And committed to reducing incarceration rates
    When the Observer monitors policy implementation
    Then they see whether state agencies implement legislative intent
    And track incarceration trends after legislation passage
    And identify bureaucratic resistance to reform
    And receive alerts when outcomes diverge from expectations
    And intervene to ensure legislation achieves intended impact
