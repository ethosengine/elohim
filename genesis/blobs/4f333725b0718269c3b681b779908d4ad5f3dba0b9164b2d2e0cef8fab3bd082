Scenario: Organizing with co-workers for collective advocacy
    Given individual workers have limited power
    And collective action is more effective for workplace change
    When I want to organize with co-workers for better conditions
    Then the protocol should help me connect with co-workers safely
    And facilitate coordination for collective advocacy
    And provide information about organizing rights and strategies
    And support building worker solidarity and collective power
