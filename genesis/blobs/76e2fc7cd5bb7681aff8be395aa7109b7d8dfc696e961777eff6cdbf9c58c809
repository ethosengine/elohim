Scenario: Before and after school care affordable and accessible for working single parents
    Given Maria works 8-5 while school runs roughly 8-3
    And she cannot afford $400+/month per child for extended care across three children
    When Maria needs childcare for school schedule gaps
    Then the educational_elohim should help her access affordable before/after school care
    And schools should provide cost-effective extended care options
    And subsidies should be available for single-income families
    And care should cover the full gap between school and work hours
    And Maria should be able to maintain employment through affordable school-based care
