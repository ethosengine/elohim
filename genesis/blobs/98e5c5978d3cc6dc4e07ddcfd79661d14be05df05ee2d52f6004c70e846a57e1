Scenario: Learning about different families' economic circumstances
    Given Emma's family has $40k/year income
    And neighborhood includes families with varied economic situations
    When Emma learns about community economic diversity
    Then teaching should be age-appropriate about economic difference
    And the personal_agent should explain without judgment
    And Emma should learn that families have different resources
    And she should develop empathy about economic constraint
    And class awareness should be taught with dignity for all
    And care economy should serve families across income spectrum
