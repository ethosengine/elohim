Scenario: Sector-wide care leave and flexibility policies advocated
    Given individual companies can be limited in policy innovation
    And sector-wide policy creates competitive equity
    And Robert's experience qualifies him to advocate
    When industry_elohim supports sector policy advocacy
    Then it should connect Robert to sector policy development processes
    And help him advocate for industry-wide care leave standards
    And support proposals for sector flexibility norms
    And provide evidence about competitive advantage of care-friendly sectors
    And build industry policy that supports all workers' care needs
    And prevent individual companies from being penalized for care-friendly practices
    And advance care economy at scale through sector transformation
