Scenario: Multigenerational family care patterns include young child
    Given Tommy's grandparent is part of the extended family
    And the grandparent provides childcare
    When Tommy interacts with grandparent through care economy
    Then his care contributions should be visible to grandparent
    And grandparent's care for Tommy should be tracked
    And the family_elohim should coordinate across generations
    And Tommy should learn that care flows in multiple directions
    And family care economy should span beyond nuclear household
