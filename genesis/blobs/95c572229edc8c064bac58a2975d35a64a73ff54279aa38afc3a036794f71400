Scenario: Board member detects potential conflict of interest in vendor contract
    Given district staff recommends contract with technology vendor
    And recommendation emphasizes vendor qualifications and competitive pricing
    And board will vote on $2M multi-year contract next meeting
    When the board member uses Observer to review the recommendation
    Then they discover vendor donated to superintendent's previous campaigns
    And see vendor's track record in other districts shows implementation problems
    And find contract terms more favorable to vendor than peer district contracts
    And access data showing alternative vendors with better performance
    And capture protection makes conflict of interest and manipulation visible
