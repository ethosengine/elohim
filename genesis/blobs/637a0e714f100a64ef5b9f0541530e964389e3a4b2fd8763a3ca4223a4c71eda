Scenario: Analyzing Regional Constitutional Council decision patterns
    Given Sarah Martinez's Regional Council has reviewed 500+ appeals
    And I have anonymized data on appeals, deliberations, and outcomes
    When I analyze patterns in regional constitutional interpretation
    Then I examine: which types of appeals succeed vs fail
    And I track: consistency across different council compositions
    And I identify: whether councils reach similar conclusions for similar cases
    And I explore: how precedent influences subsequent decisions
    And I assess: whether councils defer too much to technical experts
    And I investigate: demographic patterns in council member influence
    And My analysis reveals: whether sortition governance produces coherent law
