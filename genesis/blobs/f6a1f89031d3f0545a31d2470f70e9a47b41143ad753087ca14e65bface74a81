Scenario: Tracking community wellbeing indicators over time
    Given Riverside adopted Elohim Protocol three years ago
    And I am measuring community outcomes longitudinally
    When I analyze wellbeing data before and after adoption
    Then I examine: loneliness rates (down 12%), life satisfaction (up 8%)
    And I track: crisis response effectiveness, economic resilience
    And I monitor: social cohesion, trust in institutions, civic participation
    And I conduct: comparison with similar communities without protocol
    And I use: difference-in-differences analysis to isolate protocol effects
    And I distinguish: what's protocol impact vs what's secular trend
    And I provide: evidence about whether democratic AI governance works
