Scenario: Practical neighborhood support for isolated caregiver
    Given James cannot easily leave David alone
    And small practical tasks become difficult
    When neighbors offer practical support
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate helpful offers
    And neighbors could pick up groceries or prescriptions
    And they could help with yard work or home maintenance
    And they could check in and provide human connection
    And practical support should reduce James's isolation
    And neighborhood mutual aid should serve caregivers actively
