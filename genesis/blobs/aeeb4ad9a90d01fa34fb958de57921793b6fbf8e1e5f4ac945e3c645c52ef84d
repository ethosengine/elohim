Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent
  As a grandparent with traditional knowledge of sustainable living
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want my environmental wisdom and care practices to be recognized
  So that ecological knowledge is transmitted across generations

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the grandparent user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret grew up with practices of careful resource use
    And Margaret has knowledge of food preservation, gardening, seasonal patterns
    And Margaret teaches grandchildren Tommy (5) and Emma (8) ecological practices
    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active
    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates environmental care economy

  Scenario: Traditional knowledge of food preservation and storage
    Given Margaret knows how to preserve food, reduce waste, maximize resources
    And these skills were essential in her generation
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks traditional ecological knowledge
    Then it should recognize Margaret's food preservation skills as valuable
    And it should value her knowledge of canning, freezing, storing food
    And it should facilitate teaching these skills to grandchildren
    And traditional knowledge should be documented and transmitted
    And Margaret's expertise should contribute to food security
    And ecological wisdom should accumulate care tokens
    And sustainable food practices should be valued and preserved

  Scenario: Teaching grandchildren sustainable living practices
    Given Margaret teaches Tommy and Emma to reduce waste and value resources
    And she models careful use of food, water, energy, materials
    When Margaret provides ecological education
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize environmental teaching
    And it should value transmission of sustainable living practices
    And it should track grandchildren's ecological learning
    And environmental education should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's teaching should be recognized as essential for sustainability
    And next generation should learn resource stewardship from elders

  Scenario: Knowledge of seasonal patterns and bioregional ecology
    Given Margaret has observed local seasons, weather, and ecology for decades
    And she knows when plants bloom, birds migrate, harvest happens
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks ecological knowledge
    Then it should recognize Margaret's bioregional expertise
    And it should value her understanding of local seasonal patterns
    And it should document traditional ecological knowledge
    And seasonal wisdom should be shared with grandchildren and community
    And Margaret's observation should contribute to bioregional understanding
    And traditional knowledge should inform ecological care

  Scenario: Gardening and local food production with grandchildren
    Given Margaret gardens and teaches grandchildren about growing food
    And they learn where food comes from and how to nurture plants
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food production activities
    Then it should recognize gardening as ecological care work
    And it should value teaching food production as essential education
    And it should track local food growing and knowledge transmission
    And gardening should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's teaching should support food sovereignty
    And intergenerational food knowledge should be preserved

  Scenario: Practices of frugality and resource conservation
    Given Margaret's generation learned to waste nothing and maximize resources
    And these practices are essential for ecological sustainability
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks resource conservation
    Then it should recognize Margaret's frugal practices as ecological wisdom
    And it should value conservation skills and waste reduction
    And it should track resource efficiency and reuse practices
    And frugality should be reframed as environmental stewardship
    And Margaret's practices should be recognized as climate action
    And traditional conservation knowledge should be valued and transmitted

  Scenario: Teaching reciprocal relationship with natural world
    Given Margaret teaches grandchildren to respect and care for nature
    And she models reciprocal relationship rather than extractive use
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks ecological values education
    Then it should recognize teaching reciprocity with nature
    And it should value relationship-based environmental ethics
    And it should track development of ecological consciousness
    And values education should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's teaching should support bioregional care economy
    And next generation should learn ecological reciprocity

  Scenario: Knowledge of traditional medicinal and useful plants
    Given Margaret knows traditional uses of local plants
    And she learned herbal remedies and plant knowledge from her elders
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks traditional plant knowledge
    Then it should recognize Margaret's ethnobotanical expertise
    And it should value traditional medicinal plant knowledge
    And it should facilitate transmission of plant wisdom to grandchildren
    And traditional knowledge should be documented and preserved
    And Margaret's expertise should contribute to bioregional health
    And plant knowledge should be recognized as valuable care economy contribution

  Scenario: Coordinating sustainable practices with family consumption
    Given Margaret influences family's consumption and waste patterns
    And she can teach sustainable shopping and resource use
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates family sustainability
    Then it should help Margaret guide family toward sustainable practices
    And it should recognize her role in shaping family ecological impact
    And it should track family's movement toward sustainability
    And Margaret's influence should reduce family's environmental footprint
    And intergenerational sustainability should be recognized and valued
    And family care economy should include ecological care

  Scenario: Participating in community ecological restoration and care
    Given Margaret has time and commitment for environmental stewardship
    And community needs participants in ecological restoration
    When Margaret participates in community environmental work
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize ecological care contributions
    And it should value restoration work, cleanup, and stewardship
    And it should track community environmental participation
    And ecological care should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's environmental service should be recognized
    And community ecological health should benefit from elder participation

  Scenario: Teaching food sovereignty through kitchen skills
    Given Margaret knows how to cook from scratch and make nutritious meals
    And kitchen skills support food sovereignty and health
    When Margaret teaches grandchildren cooking and food preparation

    And it should value food sovereignty education
    And it should track kitchen skills transmission
    And cooking should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's teaching should support family and community food security
    And traditional food knowledge should be preserved and valued

  Scenario: Modeling low-consumption lifestyle for next generation
    Given Margaret lives simply on retirement income
    And her low-consumption lifestyle has low environmental impact
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks consumption patterns
    Then it should recognize Margaret's low-impact lifestyle as ecological contribution

    And low-impact living should be recognized as climate action
    And Margaret's lifestyle should model sustainable living
    And intergenerational value transmission should support sustainability

  Scenario: Traditional weather knowledge and climate adaptation
    Given Margaret has observed local weather patterns for decades
    And traditional weather knowledge supports climate adaptation
