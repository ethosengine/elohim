Scenario: Activist campaigns for municipal living wage ordinance
    Given workers in the city struggle with poverty wages
    And the activist advocates for living wage policy
    When the Observer documents local wage patterns
    Then the activist shows median wage is $14/hour in city with $22/hour living wage
    And sees public subsidies go to employers paying poverty wages
    And calculates economic impact of low wages on families and communities
    And mobilizes workers and community supporters for policy campaign
    And labor advocacy gains economic evidence foundation
