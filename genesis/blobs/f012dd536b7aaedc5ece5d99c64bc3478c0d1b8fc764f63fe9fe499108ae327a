Scenario: Great-grandchildren learn care economy through elder relationship
    Given Helen's great-grandchildren are young children
    And they observe family caring for Helen
    When great-grandchildren interact with Helen
    Then they should learn that elders deserve care and respect
    And they should see care flowing reciprocally across generations
    And they should experience Helen as person, not problem
    And they should learn that humans need more care as we age
    And they should internalize that caregiving is valuable
    And the protocol should teach care economy through family relationships
    And next generation should grow up assuming care reciprocity is normal
