Scenario: Participating in neighborhood emergency response
    Given neighborhoods need mutual aid during emergencies
    When crisis occurs and I am not working
    Then the protocol should help me contribute to emergency response
    And coordinate with neighbors for mutual support
    And recognize my contribution to neighborhood resilience
    And ensure I can also access support during my emergencies
