Scenario: Maintaining personal flourishing under care responsibilities
    Given Sarah has been prioritizing everyone else's needs
    And her personal_agent monitors her well-being patterns
    And Sarah's nutrition, exercise, and social connection are declining
    When two weeks pass without self-care
    Then the personal_agent should recognize unsustainable sacrifice
    And it should prompt "You've prioritized everyone else's needs for two weeks—what would support your flourishing?"
    And it should frame self-care as essential stewardship, not selfishness
    And it should recognize that care for self enables care for others
    And Sarah should receive support in maintaining her own capacity
