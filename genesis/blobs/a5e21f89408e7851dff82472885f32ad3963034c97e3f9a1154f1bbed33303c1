Scenario: Weekend respite care for desperately needed breaks
    Given Maria parents intensively seven days per week with no co-parent breaks
    And everyone needs occasional rest to remain sustainable
    When Maria needs brief respite from parenting demands
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate respite care offers
    And neighbors should be able to take her children for a few hours
    And Maria should be able to accept respite without guilt or stigma
    And respite should be framed as care economy reciprocity, not charity
    And Maria should get occasional breaks that partnered parents get from co-parents
