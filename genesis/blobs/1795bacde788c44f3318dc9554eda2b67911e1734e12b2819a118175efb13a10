Scenario: Journalist detects environmental racism at regional scale
    Given pollution facilities cluster in certain neighborhoods
    And the journalist investigates environmental justice
    When the Observer analyzes regional environmental patterns
    Then the journalist sees industrial permits concentrate in communities of color
    And maps proximity of pollution sources to schools and residences
    And documents health outcome disparities by neighborhood and race
    And shows pattern across county regardless of municipal boundaries
    And publishes investigation exposing regional environmental racism
