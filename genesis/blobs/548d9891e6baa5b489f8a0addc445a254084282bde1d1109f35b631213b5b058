Scenario: Building household management skills incrementally
    Given Aisha has never managed a household before
    And she's learning essential adult skills
    When Aisha uses household management features
    Then the personal_agent should teach skills progressively
    And it should provide checklists for routine maintenance
    And it should remind her of non-obvious tasks (changing air filters, etc.)
    And education should integrate with task management
    And Aisha should build comprehensive household competence
    And the learning curve should feel supportive, not judgmental
