Scenario: Appeal contributes to constitutional evolution
    Given my appeal revealed a fundamental gap in the constitutional framework
    And the Constitutional Council identified this as a recurring issue
    When the council documents recommendations for protocol improvement
    Then my case becomes input for the next 7-year Constitutional Convention
    And My lived experience of feeling violated despite life-saving intervention
    And This helps shape how care and autonomy are balanced at constitutional level
    And I can see the long-term impact of my appeal beyond my individual case
    And My suffering wasn't wasted—it made the system better for everyone
