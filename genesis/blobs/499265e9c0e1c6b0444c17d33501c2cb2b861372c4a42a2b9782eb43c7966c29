Scenario: Neighborhood boundaries respect caregiver capacity
    Given James has extremely limited capacity for neighborhood activities
    And well-meaning neighbors might make unsustainable demands
    When the neighborhood_elohim manages expectations
    Then neighbors should understand James cannot contribute labor currently
    And they should offer support without expecting reciprocation immediately
    And James's care work should be recognized as neighborhood contribution
    And neighborhood should not burden caregivers with additional demands
    And boundaries should protect James from overwhelming expectations
