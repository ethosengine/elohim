Scenario: Accessing early childhood education and care for younger children
    Given my younger child (age 4) needs early childhood education
    And quality early childhood programs have long waitlists and costs
    When I seek early childhood education for my young child
    Then the Value Scanner identifies early childhood programs accepting subsidies
    And helps me access Head Start, pre-K, or subsidized childcare
    And navigates enrollment processes and waitlists
    And ensures young child has educational engagement despite constraints
    And tracks early childhood education options and applications
    And my personal_agent manages early childhood enrollment deadlines
    And recognizes early childhood education coordination as parenting work
    And validates that young children deserve educational opportunities
