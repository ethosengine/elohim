Scenario: Adult children's transition to independence coordinated at household level
    Given Robert and Jennifer's children are ages 19 and 22
    And the children are establishing independence with parental support
    And financial support needs to be coordinated between partners
    When household_elohim tracks child support
    Then it should make support patterns visible
    And help Robert and Jennifer align on support philosophy
    And surface when support exceeds household capacity
    And track support timeline: "Jordan has received $15k over 18 months for apartment and education"
    And help them negotiate appropriate levels of ongoing support
    And prevent one partner from committing household resources unilaterally
    And support coordinated approach to launching adult children
