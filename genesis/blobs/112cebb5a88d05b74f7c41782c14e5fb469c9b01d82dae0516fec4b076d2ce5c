Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities
  As a person with disabilities living independently with support
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want my full autonomy, accessibility needs, and care contributions to be recognized
  So that I can flourish with dignity as a complete person with agency and voice

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the person_with_disabilities user "Alex" is registered in the system
    And Alex is 35 years old
    And Alex has cerebral palsy affecting mobility and fine motor control
    And Alex uses a wheelchair for mobility
    And Alex works part-time remotely as a data analyst
    And Alex's income is approximately $35k/year from employment and disability benefits
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Alex's personal_agent is configured for accessibility with voice interface
    And Alex lives independently with support services

  Scenario: Genuinely accessible interface enables full participation
    Given Alex needs to use the Value Scanner
    And Alex has limited fine motor control
    When Alex opens the Value Scanner
    Then the interface should support voice commands fully
    And it should be compatible with Alex's screen reader
    And keyboard navigation should work for all functions
    And visual settings should be customizable for contrast and size
    And the interface should be forgiving with error recovery
    And accessibility should be built-in, not retrofitted
    And Alex should experience the system as designed for them
    And universal design principles should be evident throughout

  Scenario: Personal agent serves Alex with dignity and respect
    Given Alex's personal_agent is configured for their specific needs
    And Alex has full autonomy over their life decisions
    When the personal_agent provides support
    Then it should respect Alex's expertise about their own needs
    And it should never be patronizing or pitying in tone
    And it should support Alex's decision-making without manipulation
    And Alex should maintain complete authority over choices
    And the agent should feel like a genuine partner
    And Alex's disability should be accommodated, not pathologized
    And every interaction should center dignity and autonomy

  Scenario: Voice interface enables hands-free shopping list creation
    Given Alex is planning their weekly groceries
    And Alex has difficulty with fine motor tasks
    When Alex wants to create a shopping list
    Then Alex should be able to use voice commands exclusively
    And the system should accurately recognize Alex's speech patterns
    And Alex should be able to add, remove, and modify items by voice
    And the interface should provide clear audio feedback
    And Alex should not be forced to use touch or keyboard if they choose voice
    And the experience should be as efficient as visual interface
    And Alex should have equal access to all shopping features

  Scenario: Recognition of substantial disability advocacy contributions
    Given Alex performs significant disability advocacy work
    And Alex mentors other disabled people in their community
    And Alex does accessibility consulting for local organizations
    And this sophisticated care labor benefits entire communities
    When the Value Scanner tracks Alex's care contributions
    Then advocacy work should accumulate care tokens appropriately
    And peer mentoring should be recognized as skilled care labor
    And accessibility consulting should be valued explicitly
    And community organizing should count toward care economy standing
    And Alex's substantial contributions should be made visible
    And society should see Alex as contributor, not burden
    And Alex's care work should shape their economic standing

  Scenario: Personal data privacy under Alex's complete control
    Given Alex's data includes sensitive disability and medical information
    And this data reveals intimate details about Alex's body and needs
    When data is collected about Alex's care patterns
    Then Alex must have absolute control over all data sharing
    And medical information should never be shared without explicit consent
    And disability status should be shared only when Alex chooses
    And support coordinators should access only what Alex permits
    And employers should never see medical or disability data without authorization
    And Alex's privacy must be protected with highest standards
    And data governance should respect Alex's autonomy completely

  Scenario: Personal agent prevents accessibility barriers proactively
    Given Alex encounters accessibility barriers constantly
    And the personal_agent monitors Alex's environment
    When Alex plans activities or purchases
    Then the agent should identify accessibility barriers in advance
    And it should provide information about accommodations available
    And it should suggest accessible alternatives when needed
    And it should help Alex advocate for improved accessibility
    And barrier documentation should support systems change advocacy
    And Alex should experience fewer surprises and obstacles
    And the protocol should reduce disability-related stress

  Scenario: Coordination of support services with Alex maintaining authority
    Given Alex requires assistance with some physical tasks
    And Alex coordinates support workers for specific needs
    When support services are scheduled
    Then Alex should have complete authority over service direction
    And the personal_agent should help coordinate schedules efficiently
    And Alex should be able to communicate needs clearly
    And support quality should be tracked per Alex's assessment
    And Alex should experience professional partnership, not caretaking
    And the relationship should be employer/coordinator to service provider
    And Alex's autonomy should be structurally protected

  Scenario: Personal flourishing recognized as legitimate goal
    Given Alex has the right to pursue their own flourishing
    And society often treats disabled lives as tragedies
    When the personal_agent supports Alex's well-being
    Then it should frame Alex's flourishing as inherent right
    And it should support Alex's self-determined goals
    And disability should not be assumed to diminish quality of life
    And Alex's life should be treated as valuable as anyone's
    And personal goals should be respected, not pitied
    And the protocol should embody belief in Alex's full humanity
    And Alex should experience affirmation of their worth

  Scenario: Customizable interaction modes support diverse capabilities
    Given Alex's capabilities vary day to day
    And fatigue, pain, or other factors affect what's accessible
    When Alex uses the Value Scanner on different days
    Then Alex should be able to switch between interaction modes easily
    And voice, touch, keyboard, and switch access should all be available
    And the system should remember Alex's preferences per context
    And Alex should not have to repeatedly explain needs
    And flexible modes should accommodate fluctuating capabilities
    And the interface should adapt to Alex, not force Alex to adapt

  Scenario: Disability culture and identity respected and affirmed
    Given Alex's disability is part of their identity
    And disabled people have distinct culture and community
    When the Value Scanner represents disability
    Then it should use identity-first or person-first language per Alex's preference
    And it should present disability as difference, not deficit
    And it should connect Alex to disability community resources
    And disability culture should be recognized as valuable
    And Alex should see positive representation of disability
    And the protocol should embody social model, not medical model
    And Alex's disabled identity should be affirmed, not erased

  Scenario: Personal agency maintained even when needing support
    Given Alex requires assistance with some aspects of life
    And society often conflates needing help with lacking agency
    When Alex makes decisions about their life
    Then needing support should not diminish Alex's autonomy
    And the system should separate assistance from authority
    And Alex should maintain full decision-making power
    And support should flow to Alex's direction, not override it
    And interdependence should be recognized as human reality
    And Alex's agency should be protected even when vulnerable
    And the protocol should embody disability rights principle: "Nothing about us without us"

  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained with full accessibility
    Given Alex has been using the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply to all users equally
    When Alex chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then disconnection process must be fully accessible
    And Alex should receive complete data export in accessible formats
    And no manipulative retention patterns should be employed
    And Alex's right to not participate must be absolute
    And data portability should work with assistive technologies
    And exit should be as accessible as entry
    And Alex's autonomy includes the right to leave
