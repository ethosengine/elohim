Scenario: Personal agent adapts to Sarah's individual values and culture
    Given Sarah has specific cultural background and personal values
    And her family has chosen value frameworks
    When the personal_agent provides guidance
    Then it should align with Sarah's cultural context
    And it should respect her personal value priorities
    And it should serve her chosen framework, not impose external values
    And diverse cultural approaches to care should be honored
    And the protocol should be culturally adaptive, not prescriptive
