Feature: National-Level Governance Research for Researcher
  As a researcher in the governance system
  Operating at the national governance layer
  I want to analyze governance patterns affecting entire nations
  So that I can inform national policy and understand democratic AI at scale

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the researcher user is registered in the system
    And the nation_state governance context is active
    And Dr. James Chen is studying national-scale democratic governance

  Scenario: Analyzing national Constitutional Council precedent development
    Given National Constitutional Council has created precedents affecting millions
    And I have access to five years of national-level decisions
    When I analyze how constitutional interpretation evolves over time
    Then I examine: consistency of principles across diverse cases
    And I track: precedent citation patterns and influence
    And I identify: watershed decisions that reshaped interpretation
    And I analyze: how dissenting opinions influence future majorities
    And I assess: whether interpretation drifts from constitutional text
    And I explore: emergence of constitutional "common law" through cases
    And My research reveals: how citizen governance creates coherent jurisprudence

  Scenario: National longitudinal study tracking 10-year outcomes
    Given Elohim Protocol has been adopted nationally for a decade
    And I am conducting comprehensive longitudinal evaluation
    When I analyze decade-long trajectories across thousands of communities
    Then I measure: sustained vs transient effects on wellbeing
    And I track: whether initial trust gains persist or decay
    And I examine: how children growing up with protocol differ from previous generation
    And I analyze: whether protocol transforms civic culture over time
    And I investigate: institutional evolution and adaptation patterns
    And I assess: whether benefits compound or plateau over time
    And My research captures: transformative effects that short-term studies miss

  Scenario: Comparing national adoption across different political systems
    Given different nations with different political systems adopted protocol
    And I want to understand how political context shapes implementation
    When I conduct cross-national comparative analysis
    Then I examine: adoption patterns in democracies vs mixed regimes
    And I analyze: how existing institutions integrate or resist protocol
    And I explore: whether protocol strengthens or threatens existing power structures
    And I assess: cultural factors that predict adoption success
    And I identify: universal patterns vs context-dependent adaptations
    And My research tests: whether democratic AI governance is culturally specific or universal
    And Findings inform: international adoption strategies and expectations

  Scenario: Evaluating national policy impact on protocol outcomes
    Given Senator Ruiz passed legislation supporting protocol adoption
    And I want to assess whether policy actually improved outcomes
    When I analyze communities before and after policy implementation
    Then I examine: whether funding increased adoption rates
    And I assess: whether legal recognition improved legitimacy
    And I measure: whether infrastructure support reduced access barriers
    And I explore: whether regulatory protection prevented capture
    And I identify: which policy mechanisms worked and which didn't
    And My evaluation provides: evidence for continued funding and policy refinement
    And Research serves: accountability and improvement of democratic policy

  Scenario: Studying national crisis response and protocol resilience
    Given nation experienced major crisis (pandemic, economic collapse, climate disaster)
    And protocol governance was tested under extreme conditions
    When I analyze how protocol functioned during and after crisis
    Then I examine: whether emergency coordination maintained democratic oversight
    And I assess: whether crisis pressures led to authoritarian drift
    And I measure: community resilience with protocol vs without
    And I explore: how Constitutional Councils balanced urgency with deliberation
    And I identify: protocol vulnerabilities revealed under stress
    And I analyze: recovery trajectories and institutional learning
    And My research reveals: whether democratic AI governance is resilient or fragile

  Scenario: National survey research on public trust and legitimacy
    Given I need to understand population-wide attitudes toward protocol
    And survey data provides breadth that case studies cannot
    When I conduct nationally representative survey on protocol governance
    Then I measure: trust in agents vs trust in traditional institutions
    And I assess: perceived legitimacy of Constitutional Councils
    And I explore: what predicts individual support or opposition
    And I examine: demographic patterns in trust and participation
    And I track: opinion changes over time as protocol matures
    And I identify: sources of resistance and paths to broader acceptance
    And My research informs: public engagement and communication strategies

  Scenario: Analyzing national media discourse about AI governance
    Given public understanding is shaped by media coverage
    And I want to understand how protocol is portrayed and discussed
    When I analyze national media coverage over time
    Then I examine: framing (opportunity vs threat, freedom vs control)
    And I identify: key narratives and their evolution
    And I assess: accuracy of coverage vs actual protocol function
    And I explore: elite discourse vs grassroots perspectives
    And I analyze: how coverage affects public opinion and adoption
    And I track: whether critical discourse improves protocol or undermines it
    And My research reveals: democratic deliberation about democratic AI

  Scenario: Providing congressional testimony on protocol effectiveness
    Given Congress is considering national AI governance legislation
    And Senator Ruiz invites me to testify as independent expert
    When I present research findings to legislative committee
    Then I summarize: rigorous evaluation of protocol outcomes
    And I present: evidence about effectiveness, limitations, and unknowns
    And I explain: what factors predict success and failure
    And I testify: honestly about uncertainties and contested findings
    And I respond: to questions from supportive and skeptical legislators
    And I maintain: scientific independence over political pressure
    And My testimony provides: evidence base for democratic policy choice

  Scenario: National research infrastructure enabling cumulative knowledge
    Given sustainable research requires ongoing data access and funding
    And I advocate for long-term research infrastructure
    When national research program is established with public funding
    Then independent researchers gain: anonymized data access with privacy protection
    And longitudinal tracking becomes: possible across decades
    And replication and extension: of findings is enabled
    And peer review and quality control: maintain scientific standards
    And research independence from: protocol developers is preserved
    And Knowledge accumulates: rather than being rediscovered each generation
    And Democratic AI governance becomes: evidence-based rather than ideological

  Scenario: Studying national Constitutional Convention as deliberative democracy
    Given National Constitutional Convention convenes with randomly-selected citizens
    And this is largest deliberative democracy experiment in history
    When I study the convention process and outcomes
    Then I examine: how 10,000 citizens deliberate on existential questions
    And I analyze: what enables productive vs polarizing disagreement
    And I assess: quality of deliberation at unprecedented scale
    And I explore: how amendments emerge from collective wisdom
    And I track: influence of diverse perspectives vs expert domination
    And I investigate: whether citizens can make wise choices under deep uncertainty
    And My research tests: limits and possibilities of democratic capacity

  Scenario: Null findings about protocol effects inform honest assessment
    Given my analysis found protocol didn't improve outcomes in certain domains
    And publication bias favors positive results
    When I publish findings showing limitations and failures
    Then I report: honestly about what doesn't work
    And I provide: evidence challenging protocol advocates' claims
    And I maintain: scientific integrity over ideological commitment
    And I enable: realistic expectations and targeted improvements
    And I contribute: to honest democratic deliberation about governance alternatives
    And My credibility comes from: willingness to report unflattering truths
    And Science serves democracy by: providing reliable knowledge not propaganda

  Scenario: Research on superintelligence governance and democratic legitimacy
    Given my most important research question is existential
    And I study whether sortition can govern superintelligent agents
    When I analyze Constitutional Council confidence over time as agents advance
    Then I measure: council member certainty declining as agent capability increases
    And I document: increasing expert influence as complexity exceeds lay understanding
    And I identify: warning signs of democratic theater masking technocratic rule
    And I also find: hopeful pattern of councils resisting capture and demanding explainability
    And I assess: whether democratic oversight of superintelligence is possible
    And I conclude: honestly that question remains open
    And My research frames: humanity's most important governance challenge with intellectual honesty
