Scenario: Parent connects municipal budget to school funding
    Given the municipality is finalizing annual budget priorities
    And the parent doesn't understand how city budget affects schools
    When the parent reviews Observer's municipal-education analysis
    Then they see how city tax decisions impact school district funding
    And understand library budget cuts reduce children's book access
    And learn recreation spending affects afterschool program availability
    And municipal decisions connect to children's educational resources
    And parent advocacy expands to city-level budget priorities
