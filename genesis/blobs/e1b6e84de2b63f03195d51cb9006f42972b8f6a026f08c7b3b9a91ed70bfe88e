Scenario: Educational assessment measures value literacy development
    Given Sarah wants to know if children are learning value literacy
    And assessment can support or undermine learning
    When children's value literacy is assessed
    Then the educational_elohim should measure care-based decision making
    And assessment should observe whether children see care as valuable
    And it should track development of care economy principles
    And assessment should support learning, not create anxiety
    And Sarah should see children's value literacy growth over time
