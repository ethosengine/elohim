Scenario: Grappling with cultural diversity and constitutional minimums
    Given appeal involves community with different cultural practices
    And tension exists between cultural values and constitutional principles
    When we deliberate on cultural context and universal minimums
    Then we honor: legitimate cultural diversity
    And we distinguish: variation from violations of human dignity
    And we examine: if protocol accommodates cultural specificity
    And we balance: universal minimums with cultural respect
    And we avoid: both cultural imperialism and harmful relativism
    And we create: precedent protecting pluralism within constitutional bounds
    And we demonstrate: wisdom ordinary citizens bring to complex questions
