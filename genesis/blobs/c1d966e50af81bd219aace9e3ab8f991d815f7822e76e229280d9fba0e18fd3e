Scenario: Participating in food sovereignty initiatives
    Given corporate food systems extract from workers and communities
    And alternative food systems can support local care economy
    When I want to participate in food sovereignty organizing
    Then the protocol should connect me to food justice initiatives
    And support participation in food co-ops, community agriculture, or food policy
    And recognize my expertise as food worker in food systems transformation
    And build bioregional food systems aligned with care economy
