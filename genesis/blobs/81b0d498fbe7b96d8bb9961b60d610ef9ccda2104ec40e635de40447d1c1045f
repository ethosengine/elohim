Scenario: Neighborhood environmental initiatives coordinate care for place
    Given neighborhood shares common environmental interests
    And ecological care is part of care economy
    When neighborhood organizes environmental initiatives
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate collective action
    And it should track contributions to neighborhood environment
    And it should organize community gardens, clean-ups, sustainability efforts
    And care for place should be recognized as care work
    And neighborhood should steward shared environment
