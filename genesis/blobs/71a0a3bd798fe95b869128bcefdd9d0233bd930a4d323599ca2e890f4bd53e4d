Scenario: Municipal Constitutional Council handles city-level appeals
    Given some appeals affect multiple neighborhoods or city as whole
    And community-layer councils referred case to municipal level
    When Municipal Constitutional Council reviews the appeal
    Then I provide: city-wide context for their deliberation
    And they evaluate: if decision aligns with city's constitutional interpretation
    And they consider: effects across all Riverside neighborhoods
    And they create: municipal-level precedent
    And they may recommend: city council policy action
    And I implement: their recommendations respecting their authority
    And municipal governance: maintains democratic accountability
