Scenario: After-school supervision coordination for latchkey prevention
    Given Maria works until 5pm while school ends at 3pm
    And she cannot afford formal after-school care for three children
    When children need supervision between school and Maria's work end
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate informal after-school care
    And it should connect Maria to neighbors who are home during those hours
    And it should track reciprocal care contributions to maintain fairness
    And neighborhood coordination should provide affordable childcare solution
    And Maria's children should have safe supervision despite her work schedule
