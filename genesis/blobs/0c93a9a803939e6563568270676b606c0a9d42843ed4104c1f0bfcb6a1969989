Scenario: Activist shares evidence-based call to action
    Given the activist has researched city council voting records on housing
    And they have compiled data showing repeated votes against affordability
    When they create a contribution calling for community action
    And they attach verified sources and documentation
    And they propose attending the next city council meeting
    Then the system evaluates the evidence quality
    And the contribution reaches all organizing space members immediately
    And it reaches wider community with evidence-based reach boost
    And community members can endorse the call to action
    And coordination tools help organize attendance and testimony
