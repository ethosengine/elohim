Scenario: Convention creates amendments from accumulated lived experience
    Given amendments emerge from decades of appeals and precedents
    And each came from individual suffering or struggle
    When we pass amendments informed by countless stories
    Then Marcus's privacy appeal: shaped care-autonomy balance amendment
    And Tommy's adolescent case: informed developing autonomy recognition
    And Watershed conflict: influenced ecological standing provision
    And Maria's loan denial: affected economic dignity standards
    And my nursing: contributed to healthcare as constitutional right
    And constitution evolves: from lived experience not abstract theory
    And we demonstrate: how individual recourse informs collective wisdom
