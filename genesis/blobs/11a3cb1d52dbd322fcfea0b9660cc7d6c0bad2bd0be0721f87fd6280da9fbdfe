Scenario: Child influences family values while family shapes child
    Given Emma is forming her own values at age 8
    And family values still primarily guide her
    When Emma suggests trying new products or priorities
    Then the family_elohim should track her value proposals
    And Sarah should receive prompts to consider Emma's input
    And Emma's voice should genuinely influence family decisions
    And bidirectional value formation should occur
    And Emma should experience being heard in family governance
    And family culture should evolve with children's input
