Scenario: Protecting individual autonomy under employment pressure
    Given my employer demands maximum flexibility
    And employment pressure threatens my autonomy
    When I need to maintain boundaries for self-care
    Then my personal_agent should help me recognize when boundaries are violated
    And support me in protecting essential personal time
    And remind me that I have rights beyond being a labor unit
    And provide language for asserting my needs
