Scenario: Organizer mobilizes community against polluting facility permit
    Given a company seeks permit for facility in Black neighborhood
    And already has history of violations
    When the organizer uses Observer to support community opposition
    Then they access company's complete violation and enforcement record
    And see health impacts from similar facilities elsewhere
    And calculate cumulative pollution burden on neighborhood
    And organize residents for powerful testimony at permit hearing
    And environmental organizing prevents new pollution in overburdened community
