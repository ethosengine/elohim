Scenario: Cross-community appeal requiring regional coordination
    Given my appeal involves agent decisions affecting multiple communities
    And communities have different local calibrations creating conflict
    When Regional Constitutional Council reviews the inter-community issue
    Then they evaluate how subsidiarity principle applies across communities
    And They examine if regional coordination is constitutionally required
    And They consider if local diversity should be preserved or harmonized
    And They may establish regional minimums while allowing local variation
    And They create precedent for how communities coordinate at scale
    And My appeal contributes to multi-layer governance coherence
