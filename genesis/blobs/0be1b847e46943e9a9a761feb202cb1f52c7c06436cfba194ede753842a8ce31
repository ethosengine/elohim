Scenario: Habitat for Humanity work recognized as housing care economy contribution
    Given Frank's volunteer work builds housing for families in need
    And his construction expertise enables affordable housing
    When the community_elohim tracks housing care economy
    Then Frank's work should be recognized as addressing housing crisis
    And building homes should be valued as community care contribution
    And his labor should be connected to housing outcomes (families housed)
    And community should see that Frank's work creates housing that policy fails to provide
    And volunteer construction should be understood as care economy infrastructure
    And Frank should experience his work as meaningful community contribution
