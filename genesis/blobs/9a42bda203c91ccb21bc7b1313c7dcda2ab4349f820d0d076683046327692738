Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver
  As a caregiver managing household for dependent adults
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want household governance that recognizes care complexity and reduced capacity
  So that household functions sustainably despite intensive care demands

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the caregiver user "James" is registered in the system
    And James shares household with David who has early-onset Alzheimer's
    And David's capability is progressively declining
    And James manages household governance for both of them
    And household income is severely reduced (~$40k/year from part-time work)
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim coordinates household care economy
    And James is simultaneously caregiver and household manager

  Scenario: Household governance transitions as care recipient loses capacity
    Given David participated in household decisions before diagnosis
    And his decision-making capability is now declining
    When the household_elohim tracks governance participation
    Then it should recognize David's changing capacity sensitively
    And it should adjust his governance role appropriately
    And it should preserve David's dignity despite declining capability
    And it should support James in taking on decisions David once made
    And governance transition should be respectful and gradual
    And David should maintain maximum autonomy possible

  Scenario: Household budget management on severely reduced income
    Given household income dropped from $80k to ~$40k/year
    And medical expenses have increased significantly
    And caregiving prevents James from full-time employment
    When James manages household finances
    Then the household_elohim should track constrained budget carefully
    And it should help prioritize essential expenses
    And it should identify financial assistance resources
    And it should recognize economic strain as care-related
    And household should access care economy support based on need
    And financial precarity should be addressed systematically

  Scenario: Household care labor made visible despite reduced monetary income
    Given James's care work is worth $50k+/year professionally
    And household monetary income is only $40k/year
    When household economics are evaluated
    Then the household_elohim should show total household value
    And James's care labor should be valued alongside income
    And household should be recognized as generating $90k+ total value
    And care work should count as household economic contribution
    And reduced monetary income should not mean reduced household value

  Scenario: Household food planning for specialized care needs
    Given David requires special nutrition for Alzheimer's care
    And James must manage David's changing appetite and needs
    And household food budget is constrained
    When James plans household meals
    Then the household_elohim should support specialized meal planning
    And it should track David's nutritional requirements
    And it should help James meet care needs within budget
    And it should ensure James's own nutrition isn't neglected
    And household food planning should serve both members

  Scenario: Household safety modifications as care needs increase
    Given David requires increasing safety monitoring
    And household needs modifications for safe caregiving
    When household safety is assessed
    Then the household_elohim should identify needed modifications
    And it should connect James to resources for safety equipment
    And it should help finance modifications through care economy
    And household should be adaptable to progressive care needs
    And safety should be maintained as capability declines

  Scenario: Household schedule coordination around intensive care demands
    Given David requires constant supervision and care
    And James must balance caregiving with part-time work
    When household schedules are coordinated
    Then the household_elohim should integrate care demands with work
    And it should identify conflicts between care and employment
    And it should help James negotiate sustainable scheduling
    And household operations should be possible despite constraints
    And schedule coordination should prevent impossible demands

  Scenario: Household resource allocation prioritizes care sustainability
    Given household resources are severely limited
    And care needs are high and increasing
    When household resources are allocated
    Then the household_elohim should prioritize care sustainability
    And it should ensure James has resources for respite
    And it should allocate funds for both David's and James's needs
    And resource decisions should prevent caregiver burnout
    And household economics should serve sustainable caregiving

  Scenario: Household privacy protected amid care intimacy
    Given James provides intimate personal care for David
    And household care generates extremely private data
    When household care is documented
    Then privacy must be absolutely protected
    And David's dignity must be preserved in all data
    And intimate care details should never be exposed
    And household data should remain under James's control
    And privacy protection should be comprehensive and inviolable

  Scenario: Household emergency preparedness for care crisis
    Given David's condition could deteriorate suddenly
    And James could become ill and unable to provide care
    When the household_elohim plans for emergencies
    Then it should maintain emergency care plans
    And it should identify backup caregivers
    And it should ensure emergency contacts are current
    And it should prepare for crisis scenarios
    And household should have resilience planning for care emergencies

  Scenario: Household technology adapted for caregiving support
    Given James uses technology for care coordination
    And household needs assistive technology for David
    When household technology is configured
    Then the household_elohim should support care technology integration
    And it should help James use monitoring and safety technology
    And it should ensure technology serves caregiving needs
    And assistive devices should be coordinated through household system
    And technology should reduce burden, not increase complexity

  Scenario: Household care economy supplements for financial strain
    Given household income is severely reduced by caregiving
    And care expenses are high and increasing
    When household economic status is assessed
    Then care token supplements should be available
    And household should receive care economy financial support
    And access should be dignified and non-stigmatizing
    And care economy should function as household safety net
    And financial support should recognize caregiving economic impact

  Scenario: Household maintenance sustained despite overwhelming care demands
    Given James is overwhelmed with caregiving responsibilities
    And routine household maintenance is difficult to maintain
    When household maintenance needs arise
    Then the household_elohim should connect to community support
    And neighbors should be able to assist with household tasks
    And care economy should enable mutual aid for household maintenance
    And James should access help without depleting limited finances
    And household should remain functional despite care intensity
