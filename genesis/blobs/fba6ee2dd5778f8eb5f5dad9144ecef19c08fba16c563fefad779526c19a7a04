Scenario: Teaching reciprocal relationship with natural world
    Given Margaret teaches grandchildren to respect and care for nature
    And she models reciprocal relationship rather than extractive use
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks ecological values education
    Then it should recognize teaching reciprocity with nature
    And it should value relationship-based environmental ethics
    And it should track development of ecological consciousness
    And values education should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's teaching should support bioregional care economy
    And next generation should learn ecological reciprocity
