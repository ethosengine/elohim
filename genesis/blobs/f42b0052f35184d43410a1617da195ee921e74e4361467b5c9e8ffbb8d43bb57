Scenario: Remote work as disability accommodation maintains employment access
    Given Alex works remotely as necessary accommodation
    And remote work enables Alex's employment despite mobility limitations
    When workplace policies change
    Then Alex's right to remote work accommodation should be protected
    And the workplace_elohim should document remote work as accommodation
    And employer cannot eliminate remote work for Alex without undue hardship proof
    And Alex's legal right to accommodation should override general policy changes
    And the protocol should help Alex defend remote work arrangement
    And pandemic-normalized remote work should benefit disabled workers permanently
    And Alex should not lose employment due to return-to-office mandates
