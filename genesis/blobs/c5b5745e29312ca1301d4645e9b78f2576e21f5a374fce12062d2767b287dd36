Scenario: Municipal resources accessible to teen based on care contribution
    Given the municipality offers public services and resources
    And Jasmine has demonstrated substantial care economy participation
    When she seeks to access municipal programs
    Then her care contributions should qualify her for access
    And municipal_elohim should recognize her as a legitimate community member
    And she should access libraries, recreation facilities, and public programs independently
    And municipal services should be teen-accessible without parental mediation
    And public resources should serve all ages based on contribution and need
    And she should experience being a valued member of the city
