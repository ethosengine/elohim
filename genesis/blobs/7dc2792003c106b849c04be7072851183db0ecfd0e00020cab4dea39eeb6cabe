Scenario: Personal agent serves as thinking partner for overwhelming decisions
    Given Maria faces countless decisions daily with no co-parent to consult
    And she manages children's needs, household economics, work schedule, and logistics alone
    When Maria needs to make a complex decision
    Then her personal_agent should function as cognitive co-parent
    And it should help her think through decisions systematically
    And it should surface important factors she might miss in exhaustion
    And it should track patterns and provide analysis
    And it should support her sovereignty without imposing its own agenda
    And Maria should have the thinking partnership that coupled parents get from each other
