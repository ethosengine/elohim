Scenario: Accessing community crisis support during emergencies
    Given workers often lack economic buffers for emergencies
    When I experience health crisis, job loss, or other emergency
    Then the protocol should rapidly connect me to community crisis support
    And facilitate emergency mutual aid based on my care contributions
    And provide immediate practical support during crisis
    And ensure community safety net catches workers in need
