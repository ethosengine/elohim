Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent
  As a grandparent coordinating care across three generations
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want multigenerational care relationships to be visible and reciprocal
  So that family care economy flows equitably across generations

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the grandparent user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret's family includes her daughter Sarah and grandchildren Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And Margaret's family also includes her 92-year-old mother
    And Margaret provides 25 hours/week childcare for Sarah's children
    And Margaret also coordinates care for her elderly mother
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy

  Scenario: Grandparent care contributions visible to entire family
    Given Margaret provides substantial childcare for Sarah's family
    And her care work saves Sarah ~$1,500/month in childcare costs
    When the family_elohim tracks Margaret's care contributions
    Then Sarah should see quantified value of Margaret's labor
    And the grandchildren should learn that grandma provides valuable work
    And the full family should recognize Margaret's contributions
    And visibility should enable family-wide appreciation
    And Margaret's labor should be valued, not taken for granted
    And care tokens should accumulate for her substantial work
    And family should understand her economic and developmental contribution

  Scenario: Coordinating with parental authority while maintaining grandparent role
    Given Sarah is the parent with primary authority over children
    And Margaret needs to honor Sarah's parenting choices
    When the family_elohim coordinates care boundaries
    Then it should help Margaret align with Sarah's values and rules
    And it should preserve Margaret's unique grandparent identity
    And it should navigate between parental authority and grandparent autonomy
    And Margaret should not be subordinate (taking orders) or superior (overriding choices)
    And family_elohim should help them work as partners in child-rearing
    And relationship should be mutually respectful and collaborative
    And complex multigenerational dynamics should be coordinated skillfully

  Scenario: Teaching grandchildren care economy values and principles
    Given Margaret is modeling care economy through her actions
    And Tommy and Emma are learning from her example
    When Margaret provides care and teaches family values
    Then the family_elohim should support intergenerational value transmission
    And children should learn that care creates value
    And they should see that elders have wisdom and worth
    And they should understand families are reciprocal care networks
    And Margaret's care teaching should be recognized as developmental work
    And next generation should internalize care economy principles
    And family culture should be transformed through children's learning

  Scenario: Margaret's own elder care work made visible to family
    Given Margaret coordinates care for her 92-year-old mother
    And she navigates "sandwich generation" care obligations
    When the family_elohim tracks Margaret's elder care
    Then it should recognize this as substantial care labor
    And it should show Margaret is caring across three generations
    And Sarah should see Margaret's total care burden
    And grandchildren should see Margaret modeling elder care
    And elder care should accumulate care tokens alongside grandparenting
    And family should understand Margaret's comprehensive care work
    And her care for her own mother should be visible and valued

  Scenario: Reciprocal care flows across three generations
    Given Margaret receives some support from Sarah as she ages
    And Margaret provides childcare for Sarah's children
    And Margaret provides elder care for her own mother
    When the family_elohim analyzes multigenerational care patterns
    Then it should show care flowing in multiple directions
    And it should ensure care is not unidirectionally extractive
    And it should recognize reciprocity across time and generations
    And family relationships should be based on mutual support
    And care economy should be sustainable across generations
    And the system should enable healthy multigenerational care patterns

  Scenario: Family decision-making about care arrangements and boundaries
    Given care arrangements affect multiple family members
    And boundaries need to be negotiated and maintained
    When the family discusses care commitments and changes
    Then the family_elohim should facilitate clear communication
    And it should help family make decisions that respect all members
    And Margaret's capacity and boundaries should be honored
    And Sarah's parenting authority should be respected
    And care arrangements should be mutually agreed upon
    And family governance should be participatory and equitable
    And decisions should serve the flourishing of all generations

  Scenario: Grandchildren learning to value elders through relationship
    Given Margaret's care work builds deep bonds with grandchildren
    And she teaches them to respect and value older adults
    When Tommy and Emma interact with Margaret over years
    Then the family_elohim should track relationship development
    And it should recognize Margaret's role in shaping their attitudes toward elders
    And children should learn that aging doesn't diminish worth
    And they should see Margaret as capable, wise, and valuable
    And this learning will matter when Margaret needs care herself
    And next generation is being prepared to value and care for elders
    And intergenerational relationships should be mutually enriching

  Scenario: Preventing exploitation of grandparent care labor
    Given Margaret provides substantial unpaid care
    And she could potentially be taken advantage of
    When the family_elohim monitors care economy equity
    Then it should flag if Margaret's contributions are excessive relative to reciprocity
    And it should prevent family from treating her as "free childcare"
    And it should ensure her care work is appreciated and valued
    And it should help family recognize when to compensate or reciprocate
    And Margaret should have standing to set boundaries
    And care economy should protect grandparents from exploitation
    And family relationships should be equitable, not extractive

  Scenario: Coordinating between Margaret's household and Sarah's household
    Given Margaret has her own household with Robert
    And Sarah has her household with her own governance
    When the family_elohim coordinates across households
    Then it should respect both household autonomies
    And it should help negotiate care arrangements between households
    And it should coordinate schedules, logistics, and expectations
    And boundaries between households should be clear and respected
    And neither household should dominate the other
    And care coordination should serve both households' needs
    And multigenerational care should work across household boundaries

  Scenario: Family cultural and value transmission through grandparenting
    Given Margaret carries family history, traditions, and values
    And she teaches these to grandchildren through care relationship
    When the family_elohim tracks cultural transmission
    Then it should recognize this as valuable family work
    And it should support Margaret's role as family culture keeper
    And it should value intergenerational wisdom sharing
    And cultural education should be recognized as care labor
    And family identity should be strengthened across generations
    And Margaret's teaching should be appreciated and supported

  Scenario: Supporting Sarah's work and life through care provision
    Given Margaret's childcare enables Sarah to work and thrive
    And this support is essential to Sarah's economic security
    When the family_elohim tracks how care enables flourishing
    Then it should show that Margaret's care supports Sarah's career
    And it should recognize care as infrastructure for Sarah's life
    And it should make visible that Margaret enables Sarah's economic participation
    And multigenerational care should enable all generations to thrive
    And Margaret's contribution to Sarah's flourishing should be recognized
    And care economy should show how generations support each other

  Scenario: Family care legacy and preparing for Margaret's own aging
    Given Margaret is building care economy capital through current contributions
    And she will need increasing care as she ages
    When the family_elohim tracks care patterns across time
    Then it should show Margaret's accumulated care contributions
    And it should recognize she is building reciprocal relationships
    And it should help family understand care flows across life stages
    And grandchildren learning now will be caregivers later
    And Sarah will reciprocate care as Margaret ages
    And family care economy should be sustainable across time
    And Margaret's current care should create future care security
