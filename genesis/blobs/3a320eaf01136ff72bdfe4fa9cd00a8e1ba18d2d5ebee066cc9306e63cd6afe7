Scenario: Household maintenance coordinated with accessibility considerations
    Given Alex's household requires regular maintenance
    And some maintenance tasks are physically inaccessible to Alex
    When household maintenance needs arise
    Then the household_elohim should help Alex coordinate necessary services
    And it should identify which tasks need external assistance
    And it should help Alex hire appropriate service providers
    And Alex should maintain authority over what work is done and how
    And service providers should respect Alex's expertise about their own home
    And coordination should be efficient and dignity-preserving
    And Alex should be able to maintain their home independently with appropriate support
