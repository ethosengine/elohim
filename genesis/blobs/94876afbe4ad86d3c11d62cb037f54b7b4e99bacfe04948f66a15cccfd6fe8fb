Scenario: Experiencing transformation through global service
    Given I began as nurse who never imagined governance role
    And I served community, regional, national, now global councils
    When I reflect on my journey through sortition democracy
    Then I have developed: constitutional literacy and deliberative wisdom
    And I have learned: to judge under uncertainty with humility
    And I have experienced: democratic participation as transformation
    And I have contributed: to governance at every scale
    And I have become: more fully human through invitation to govern
    And I have proven: ordinary people can address extraordinary questions
    And I embody: hope that democracy can govern with AI toward flourishing
