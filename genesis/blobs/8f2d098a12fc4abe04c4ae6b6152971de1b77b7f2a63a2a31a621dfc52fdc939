Scenario: Learning essential neighborhood resources while in crisis
    Given I have just moved to this neighborhood in crisis circumstances
    And I need to quickly learn where essential services are located
    When I explore my new neighborhood
    Then the Value Scanner maps critical local resources
    And identifies nearest food assistance, medical care, schools, childcare
    And surfaces public transportation routes and walkability
    And locates free/low-cost resources for children (parks, libraries, activities)
    And provides information about neighborhood safety and character
    And my personal_agent creates personalized neighborhood resource guide
    And updates information as I discover new resources
    And helps me build neighborhood knowledge efficiently
