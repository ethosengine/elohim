Scenario: Adult-capable interface for sophisticated decision-making
    Given Jasmine is using the Value Scanner independently
    And she has complex financial goals and multiple contexts to manage
    When Jasmine opens the scanner application
    Then the interface should provide comprehensive budgeting tools
    And the personal_agent should offer professional-grade financial analysis
    And multi-context care tracking should be available (school, work, family, community)
    And sophisticated planning and analysis features should be accessible
    And privacy controls should be granular and user-controlled
    And the interface should treat Jasmine as the competent person she is
