Scenario: Community privacy protects members while enabling coordination
    Given community care economy involves data about many people
    And privacy must be protected rigorously
    When community care patterns are tracked
    Then the community_elohim should only share aggregated data
    And individual household details should remain private
    And Sarah should control what community sees about her family
    And community coordination should not require privacy sacrifice
    And data should serve community well-being, not surveillance
