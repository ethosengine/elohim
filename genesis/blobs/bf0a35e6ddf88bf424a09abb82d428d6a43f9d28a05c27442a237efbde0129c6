Scenario: Planning for crisis response maintaining democratic oversight
    Given emergencies require rapid coordination
    And I must balance speed with democratic legitimacy
    When I establish crisis response protocols
    Then Community Elohim: helps coordinate response rapidly
    And I maintain: human judgment for crisis decisions
    And Constitutional Council: provides oversight even under urgency
    And emergency powers: have clear limits and sunset provisions
    And we preserve: democratic accountability during crisis
    And we plan: for resilience without sacrificing governance principles
    And we demonstrate: democracy can be both deliberative and responsive
