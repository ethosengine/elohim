Scenario: Building community care economy capital that will serve me beyond crisis
    Given my care contributions during crisis are tracked and recognized
    And care economy capital could support me after crisis resolves
    When I accumulate care tokens through ongoing care contributions
    Then the Value Scanner tracks my comprehensive care economy participation
    And recognizes parenting, peer support, mutual aid, knowledge sharing, and other contributions
    And builds care economy standing that will endure beyond temporary vulnerability
    And validates that my crisis period contributions are valuable
    And creates basis for future community support if needed
    And my personal_agent helps me understand my care economy capital
    And documents that vulnerability doesn't erase contribution
    And ensures my care work is recognized long-term
