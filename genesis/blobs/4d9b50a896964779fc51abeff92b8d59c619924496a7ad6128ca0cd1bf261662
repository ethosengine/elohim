Scenario: Mayor verifies lobbyist claims with independent evidence
    Given business lobbyists claim regulations will kill jobs
    And present alarming economic projections
    When the Observer fact-checks lobbying claims
    Then they see similar regulations in comparable cities
    And review actual economic impacts versus predicted disasters
    And identify which lobbyist projections proved accurate historically
    And evaluate claims against track record
    And resist manipulation through evidence-based analysis
