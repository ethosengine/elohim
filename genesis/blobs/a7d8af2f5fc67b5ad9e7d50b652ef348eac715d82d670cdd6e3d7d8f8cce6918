Scenario: Democratic food system challenges corporate distributor business model
    Given corporate distributors depend on opacity and extraction for profit
    And their value proposition (convenience, consistency) doesn't justify 400% markup
    When democratic network demonstrates distribution without extraction
    Then corporate distributors face competitive threat from transparent alternative
    And necessary distribution functions (logistics, aggregation) are provided at cost-recovery pricing
    And extractive markup is proven unnecessary for functioning supply chain
    And food industry learns distribution can be democratic cooperative, not profit-maximizing corporation
    And industry_sector_elohim documents cost comparison between extractive and democratic distribution
