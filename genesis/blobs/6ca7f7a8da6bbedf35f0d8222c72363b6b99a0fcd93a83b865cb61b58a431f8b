Scenario: Municipal resource allocation reflects care economy priorities
    Given Robert participates in municipal budget processes
    And care economy principles should inform resource allocation
    And municipal budgets often underfund care infrastructure
    When municipal_elohim supports budget advocacy
    Then it should help him understand municipal budget priorities
    And surface opportunities to advocate for care infrastructure funding
    And connect him to budget hearings and participatory budgeting
    And help him articulate how care infrastructure serves community wellbeing
    And support advocacy for elder care, childcare, and caregiver support funding
    And build municipal budgets that prioritize care economy
    And demonstrate that care should be public infrastructure priority
