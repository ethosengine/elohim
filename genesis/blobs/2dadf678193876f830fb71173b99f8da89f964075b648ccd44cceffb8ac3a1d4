Scenario: Activist tracks state legislation across session
    Given hundreds of bills move through state legislature
    And the activist cannot attend all hearings
    When the Observer monitors state education legislation
    Then the activist receives alerts on relevant bills
    And sees analysis of policy impacts on students
    And identifies opportunities for testimony
    And tracks which legislators support or oppose
    And statewide advocacy becomes sustainable
