Scenario: Income from employment integrated with disability benefits
    Given Alex receives both part-time employment income and disability benefits
    And benefits coordination is complex
    When the workplace_elohim tracks Alex's income
    Then it should help Alex understand how employment income affects benefits
    And it should alert Alex to earnings thresholds that impact benefits
    And it should integrate with household economics management
    And Alex should be able to make informed decisions about work hours
    And the protocol should support Alex in maximizing total income
    And benefits cliffs should be navigated carefully
    And Alex's economic stability should be optimized across income sources
