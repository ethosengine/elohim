Scenario: Coordinating with neighbors for transportation
    Given I may not have reliable transportation
    And neighbors might share rides or have vehicles available
    When I need transportation for work, shopping, or other needs
    Then the protocol should help coordinate neighborhood ride-sharing
    And track reciprocal transportation support
    And reduce individual costs through sharing
    And build neighborhood care economy through mutual aid
