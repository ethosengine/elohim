Feature: Educational Impact Accountability for Developer Interests
  As a developer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want honest school impact analysis and genuine mitigation
  So that development serves families not just extracts from school systems

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the developer_interests user is registered in the system
    And the educational governance context is active

  Scenario: Developer receives honest school capacity analysis
    Given a developer proposes 300-unit residential development
    And claims it will bring tax revenue benefiting schools
    When the Observer provides independent school impact analysis
    Then the developer sees: project will generate 180 school-age children
    And local elementary school is already at 95% capacity
    And district needs $12M to expand capacity for projected enrollment
    And property tax revenue is $800K/year but school costs are $1.5M/year
    And honest analysis reveals net burden on school system

  Scenario: Responsible developer partners with district for school capacity
    Given a developer understands project will strain school capacity
    And wants to genuinely address educational impacts
    When the Observer facilitates developer-district partnership
    Then the developer negotiates: $3M contribution to school expansion
    And commits land for future school site if district needs it
    And provides temporary modular classrooms during construction of expansion
    And partnership creates genuine school capacity not just promises
    And responsible development addresses community needs

  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for school impact promises
    Given a developer claimed previous project would "support local schools"
    And implied tax revenue would benefit education
    When the Observer tracks actual school impacts
    Then analysis shows: enrollment increased 120 students
    And district had to add 6 portable classrooms
    And property tax revenue was $400K but school costs were $900K annually
    And promised "school support" was marketing not actual benefit
    And accountability creates pressure for honest impact assessment

  Scenario: Developer affordable housing benefits school stability
    Given a responsible developer builds genuinely affordable housing
    And prioritizes families over luxury apartments
    When the Observer tracks educational community impacts
    Then analysis shows: stable affordable housing reduces student mobility
    And children in affordable housing have better educational outcomes
    And schools benefit from stable enrollment not constant turnover
    And affordable development creates educational community benefit
    And genuine affordability serves families not just developer profit

  Scenario: Developer luxury housing accelerates school gentrification
    Given a developer builds high-end housing in gentrifying neighborhood
    And displacement impacts working-class families
    When the Observer analyzes school enrollment changes
    Then analysis shows: low-income student enrollment dropped 40%
    And school demographics shifted from 70% to 35% students of color
    And affordable family housing converted to luxury units
    And development accelerated displacement affecting educational equity
    And gentrification impacts on schools become visible and challengeable

  Scenario: Developer school impact fees gain accountability
    Given a developer paid $1.2M in school impact fees
    And fees were supposed to address enrollment impacts
    When the Observer tracks how district used impact fees
    Then analysis shows: fees went to general operations not capacity expansion
    And school still lacks capacity to serve development's students
    And impact fee mechanism failed to actually mitigate impacts
    And accountability creates pressure for effective mitigation requirements
    And communities demand better school impact policy

  Scenario: Developer childcare commitment becomes enforceable
    Given a developer promised on-site childcare facility as community benefit
    And families counted on childcare when development was approved
    When the Observer tracks community benefit delivery
    Then monitoring shows: childcare space was never built
    And developer converted it to retail space increasing revenue
    And families who moved to development lack promised childcare
    And broken commitment affects working families' ability to afford housing
    And accountability creates real consequences for unkept promises

  Scenario: Developer school partnership creates genuine community benefit
    Given a responsible developer wants to genuinely support education
    And recognizes development affects school community
    When the Observer facilitates school-developer partnership
    Then the developer commits: after-school program space in community building
    And provides scholarship fund for district students
    And employs district graduates in construction and property management
    And partnership creates lasting educational community benefit
    And genuine engagement distinguishes from token gestures
