Scenario: Appeal with significant regional impact gets extensive deliberation
    Given my case could affect thousands of families across the region
    And the constitutional question has major implications
    When Regional Constitutional Council reviews my high-stakes appeal
    Then they allocate substantial time (multiple sessions over weeks)
    And They invite testimony from diverse community leaders
    And They consult with technical experts on implementation implications
    And They examine long-term consequences of different interpretations
    And They consider dissenting views and minority perspectives
    And They produce comprehensive written opinion with reasoning
    And The thorough deliberation legitimates the significant precedent they create
