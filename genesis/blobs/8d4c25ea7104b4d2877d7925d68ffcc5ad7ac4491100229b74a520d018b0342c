Scenario: Explaining cryptographic constitutional verification to Sarah's council
    Given Sarah Martinez's Regional Council reviews Marcus's mental health appeal
    And the case involves cryptographic verification questions
    When I provide expert testimony about the technical details
    Then I translate: cryptographic proofs into accessible language
    And I explain: using analogies (locked box showing answer without revealing secret)
    And I clarify: what confidence levels mean and their limitations
    And I acknowledge: where analogies break down and complexity remains
    And I avoid: jargon that excludes or confuses
    And I ensure: Sarah understands enough to judge constitutionality
    And I inform: without dictating the decision
