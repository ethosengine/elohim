Scenario: Parent tracks municipal library service commitments
    Given the city council promised to restore library weekend hours
    And the parent's children depend on library for homework and programs
    When three months pass without weekend hours being restored
    Then the Observer alerts parent about the broken commitment
    And provides evidence from the original council promise
    And shows which council members voted for the restoration
    And parent can demand accountability for family-serving commitments
    And municipal promises to families persist despite turnover
