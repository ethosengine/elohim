Scenario: Null findings about protocol effects inform honest assessment
    Given my analysis found protocol didn't improve outcomes in certain domains
    And publication bias favors positive results
    When I publish findings showing limitations and failures
    Then I report: honestly about what doesn't work
    And I provide: evidence challenging protocol advocates' claims
    And I maintain: scientific integrity over ideological commitment
    And I enable: realistic expectations and targeted improvements
    And I contribute: to honest democratic deliberation about governance alternatives
    And My credibility comes from: willingness to report unflattering truths
    And Science serves democracy by: providing reliable knowledge not propaganda
