Scenario: Family cultural values shape elderly care approach
    Given Helen's family has specific cultural values about elder care
    And different cultures have different expectations
    When family care is coordinated
    Then the family_elohim should respect cultural context
    And care approaches should align with family cultural values
    And Helen should receive care consistent with her cultural expectations
    And family obligations should be understood culturally
    And the protocol should serve diverse family structures and values
    And no single model of "good elder care" should be imposed
    And cultural wisdom about aging should be honored
