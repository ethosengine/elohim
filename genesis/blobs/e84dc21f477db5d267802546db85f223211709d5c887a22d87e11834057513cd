    Given industries should be accountable to care economy principles
    And industry practices often exploit rather than support care
    And Robert can contribute to accountability advocacy
    When industry_elohim monitors industry accountability
    Then it should track industry performance on care economy metrics
    And help Robert advocate for accountability mechanisms
    And surface when industry practices harm caregivers
    And support campaigns for industry reform
    And build industry accountability to care economy principles
    And demonstrate that industries should serve human flourishing
    And advance care economy through accountability advocacy
