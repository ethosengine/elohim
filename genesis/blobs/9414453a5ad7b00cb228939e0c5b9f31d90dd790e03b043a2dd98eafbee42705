Scenario: Creating novel constitutional precedent for new situation
    Given an appeal presents situation never before encountered
    And existing precedents don't clearly apply
    When we engage in deep constitutional interpretation
    Then we examine: fundamental principles and their application
    And we consider: multiple interpretations and their implications
    And we consult: technical experts about possibilities
    And we study: similar cases from other regions for insight
    And we deliberate: for extended time given novelty and stakes
    And we craft: new precedent with careful reasoning
    And we document: our constitutional analysis thoroughly
    And we create: guidance for future similar cases
