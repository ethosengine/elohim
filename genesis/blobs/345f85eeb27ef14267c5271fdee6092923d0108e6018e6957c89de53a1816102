Scenario: Preparing family for Frank's eventual increased care needs
    Given Frank is currently more provider than receiver
    And his care needs will likely increase in next 10-20 years
    When family_elohim supports care planning
    Then it should help Frank discuss future care needs with family
    And prepare adult children for eventual role reversal
    And surface: "Frank's contributions now create legitimate claims later"
    And facilitate planning conversations that preserve Frank's dignity
    And help family anticipate and prepare for increasing needs
    And ensure Frank experiences agency in planning his aging
    And care reciprocity across time should be made explicit
