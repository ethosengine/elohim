Scenario: Local food access points expand through community distribution partnerships
    Given farmers markets and farm visits are not accessible to all community members
    And transportation and schedule barriers limit food access
    When democratic farm partners with community organizations for distribution
    Then produce is delivered to senior centers, community centers, and schools
    And distribution partnerships increase food access for mobility-limited residents
    And community institutions become food access points supporting local agriculture
    And equitable distribution ensures farm benefits entire community
    And community_elohim coordinates community distribution partnerships
