Scenario: Emergency support through community care network
    Given Aisha experiences a crisis (job loss, health emergency, etc.)
    And the community care network could help
    When Aisha needs emergency assistance
    Then the community_elohim should connect her to support rapidly
    And her past contributions should enable access to help
    And community mutual aid should activate
    And the system should coordinate emergency care response
    And community care economy should provide genuine safety net
    And crises should be buffered by care relationships
