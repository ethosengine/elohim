Scenario: Developer faces accountability for labor violations
    Given a developer has history of wage theft and safety violations
    And now seeks public subsidies for new project
    When the Observer surfaces labor practice track record
    Then analysis shows: 47 wage and hour violations over five years
    And 23 OSHA safety citations across projects
    And pattern of worker exploitation not isolated incidents
    And public subsidies shouldn't reward developers who exploit workers
    And labor accountability becomes approval consideration
