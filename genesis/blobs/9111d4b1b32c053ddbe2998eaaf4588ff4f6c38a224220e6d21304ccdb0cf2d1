Scenario: Emergency backup support from trusted neighbors
    Given caregiving emergencies occur unexpectedly
    And James might need urgent help with David
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates emergency support
    Then it should identify trusted neighbors for backup
    And it should ensure neighbors are trained for basic support
    And emergency contacts should be readily available
    And neighborhood should provide safety net for crisis
    And James should have local emergency backup beyond 911
