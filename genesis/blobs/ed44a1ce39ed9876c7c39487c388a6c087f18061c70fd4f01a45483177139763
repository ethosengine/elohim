Scenario: Preteen exercises genuine autonomy in real economic decisions
    Given Marcus has $75 budget for weekly groceries
    And the budget is not hypothetical but actual family resource constraint
    When Marcus uses the Value Scanner to plan weekly shopping
    Then he should have full autonomy within budget boundaries
    And his personal_agent should provide adult-level decision support
    And the interface should treat him as capable, not as a child
    And his choices should have real consequences for family survival
    And the system should recognize he's not practicing but performing
    And autonomy should be genuine, not simulated learning
