Introduction: The Church Dilemma  
In an age of exponential technological growth, the Church finds itself at a critical crossroads. As followers of Christ, we are called to be "in the world but not of it" (John 17:14-16), yet we find ourselves immersed in a digital landscape that is rapidly reshaping human behavior, relationships, and even our understanding of reality itself. This technological revolution presents both unprecedented challenges and extraordinary opportunities for the Body of Christ.  
The dilemma we face is multifaceted:

Attention and Discipleship: In a world vying for our attention through addictive technologies, how do we cultivate deep, Christ-centered discipleship? Jesus said, "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" (Matthew 6:21). In our digital age, we might ask: "Where your attention is, there your heart will be also."  
Community and Connection: While technology offers new ways to connect, it often leads to shallow relationships and isolation. How do we build authentic Christian community that reflects the intimate fellowship described in Acts 2:42-47?  
Truth and Discernment: In an era of misinformation and "fake news," how do we uphold truth and practice discernment as Jesus instructed: "Be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16)?  
Mission and Witness: How do we leverage technology to fulfill the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) while ensuring our methods align with the message of Christ?  
Justice and Equity: As technology exacerbates societal divides, how do we work towards the just and equitable world envisioned in passages like Micah 6:8 and Luke 4:18-19?  
Stewardship and Ethics: How do we develop and use technology in ways that honor our call to be good stewards of God's creation (Genesis 1:28) and love our neighbors as ourselves (Mark 12:31)?

This course seeks to address these dilemmas by integrating the insights of the Center for Humane Technology with the timeless wisdom of Scripture. We aim to equip Christians to navigate the digital age with wisdom, intentionality, and grace, fostering a "digital discipleship" that reflects the character of Christ and advances His Kingdom.  
As we embark on this journey, we're reminded of Paul's words: "See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ" (Colossians 2:8). Our goal is not to be captivated by technology, but to captivate technology for Christ's purposes.  
Join us as we explore how to be faithful witnesses in the digital age, cultivating a prophetic imagination that envisions technology aligned with God's values and purposes. Together, we'll seek to embody Jesus' prayer: "Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven" (Matthew 6:10) \- even in our digital realms.

What is happening is that we have experienced a revoloution of technology, not unike the gutenberg press,   
radio and TV.

This technological explosion of "God-like" techonolgies is accelerating faster than anything mankind has experienced before.

Everyone Agrees Something is Wrong,    
We're going to explore how to address this lack of mindfulness and agency within ourselves and the church which will hopefully make clear for us how we can upgrade our discipleship, wisdom, and deepen our faith to begin to address the crisis moment in which we find ourselves.

**Conclusion:** “The real problem of humanity is the following: We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology." EO Wilson 

The heart of the problem is this:  
We are caught in a race to the bottom of the brain stem to extract human attention. It’s a race we’re all losing. The result: addiction, social isolation, outrage, misinformation, and political polarization are all part of one interconnected system, called ​human downgrading,​ that poses an existential threat to humanity. We can reverse that threat by redesigning god-like technology to better protect the vulnerabilities of human nature and support the social fabric as reimagined in the Kingdom of God manifested in an process of reconciliation through transformation.

The church has been blindsided by technological change in particular social media has created an information environmnet that broken the epistimic community of Christians, not unlike the epistimic breakdown of community at all levels of society, local journalism, education, workplaces, politics, and family. 

The purpose of this course is to:

Address the question.   
How can we attend the same church, live in the same city, the same country, live on the same planet.  Read the same bible, read the same scriptures, experience the same story of Jesus, share the same Gospel, and at the end of the day have such wildly different perspectives on what that means in-practice?

To upgrade the collective wisdom of the church to improve our awareness and decisionmaking in a world facing emergent 'godlike' technology.   
By considering how technology is designed to extract our attention, and how our attention is sacred.   
\*State the problem clearly as to understand HOW we might begin to approach and priortize efforts towards solutions.   
\* We wil explore complex and resilient vs complicated and fragile. Generators of existential risk and how complex problem requires us to explore things in terms of systems.   
\* We will explore scriptures and bible stories which example and frame some of the concepts we will discuss.   
experience \* Propose that christians need to join in some kind of project to redesign technology with values which seek to produce the fruits of the spirint from the technology and church community we create (not just as users). 

and   
And with those foundations we will explore what Christian re-consilience work might look like if we are to restore the church and our world which requires us to contend with exponential technology.  Explore models for what the church might need to become in the near future, as we faithfully and humbly try to upgrade ourselves and our church to realize the fruits of the spirit in our community.

## The Church Dilemma

### Foundations of Humane Tech Concepts Review

Social Delimma 

1, Defining Metacrisis / Polycrisis:   
\- The interconnected web of global challenges threatening human civilization

2\. God-like technology  
\- The unprecedented power and reach of modern digital tools

3\. Truth decay  
\- The blurring of lines between fact and fiction in our information ecosystem

4\. The attention economy  
\- The commodification and manipulation of human focus for profit

5\. Institutional degradation  
\- Weakening of traditional societal pillars (family, church, politics)

6\. Social isolation  
\- Increased digital connectivity paradoxically leading to less meaningful relationships

7\. Breaking of our Epistemic Commons  
\- Fragmentation of shared understanding and knowledge creation methods

8\. Ledger of Harms  
\- Comprehensive accounting of negative externalities produced by current technological paradigms

### Foundations of Christians and Technology Learning Objectives

1\. Acknowledge that there is a crisis.  
2\. Recognize various crises(s) socio, cultural, economic.  
4\. Technology is an accelerant to crises  
    a. Social Media is a big one, the race  for your attention.  
        1\. Ledger of harms.   
    b. AI is already here, and is in a race to create an intimate personal relationship with you.   
1\. Ministry is a Marathon in a church filled with sprinters.  
  a. Churchgoers are shaped as consumers.   
2\. The church, like media, is downstream of the technology and incentives shaping culture..   
3\. Attractional-church models are our part in this race for attention.   
5\. The Church's crisis is connected. ( Mars Hill, Bodies Behind the Bus )   
6\. Goal of the class is to equip Christians and ministry leaders with agency and mission to reconcilie Christ in a world facing "godlike" technologies.

### Bible Reference(s)

Tower of Babel (Genisis 11: 1-9)  "(verse 6). And the Lord said, "“Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another’s speech”   

  \- Attention in the Bible:  phylactery, Hebrew tefillin, also spelled tephillin or tfillin, in Jewish religious practice, one of two small black leather cube-shaped cases containing Torah texts written on parchment, which, in accordance with Deuteronomy 6:8 (and similar statements in Deuteronomy 11:18 and Exodus 13:9, 16), are to be worn by male Jews 13 years of age and older as reminders of God and of the obligation to keep the Law during daily life. The name phylactery is derived from the Greek phylakterion, meaning amulet.

Matthew 14:22-31 s  But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage\! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”  
 “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said.  
Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me\!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?”

Jeremiah 17   
9 The heart is deceitful above all things,  
    and desperately sick;  
    who can understand it?  
10 “I the Lord search the heart  
    and test the mind,  
to give every man according to his ways,  
    according to the fruit of his deeds.”  
11 Like the partridge that gathers a brood that she did not hatch,  
    so is he who gets riches but not by justice;  
in the midst of his days they will leave him,  
    and at his end he will be a fool.

### Story 

The Slavery in Egypt (Exodus 1-14): This narrative describes the Israelites' suffering under Egyptian bondage, marking a significant social crisis of slavery and oppression. Moses' leadership and God's intervention through the ten plagues and the parting of the Red Sea are central to their deliverance, showcasing themes of freedom and divine justice.

The Babylonian Exile (2 Kings 24-25; Jeremiah 52): This period marks a crucial social and religious crisis for the Kingdom of Judah, as the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple, and exiled its people. This event symbolizes the loss of homeland, identity, and faith crisis, yet also a time of reflection, repentance, and spiritual renewal for the Jewish people.

The Plight of the Poor and Marginalized (Various Psalms and Prophets): Many psalms and prophetic books (e.g., Amos, Isaiah, and Micah) address social injustices, including the neglect of the poor, the exploitation by the rich, and the corruption of leaders. These texts call for justice, mercy, and righteousness, emphasizing God's concern for the marginalized.

The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37): In this parable, Jesus addresses a social crisis of ethnic prejudice and neglect of the needy. The story of a Samaritan helping a Jewish man beaten by robbers, while religious figures pass by, challenges societal norms about neighborliness and compassion across ethnic and religious boundaries.

The Early Church's Communal Living (Acts 2:42-47; Acts 4:32-37): The nascent Christian community faced the challenge of establishing a new social order based on shared beliefs and mutual support. Their practice of selling possessions to support each other addresses economic disparities and models an alternative community based on love and generosity.

### Discussion Question or Activity

What are some ways that we "the church" is reacting to this change?

What are some examples of "god-like" technology?

What are the things churches do which make sense if we look for race for attention?

### Conclusion

 “The real problem of humanity is the following: We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology." EO Wilson

### Application 

\* Success cannot be defined by attention, high-production value worship "experiences", or programs. Hot Take: the "Attractional Church" model is largely a commercial success but a failure in that it has metastasized what is in lika a tumor or an autoimmune disease, in the development of a healthy body within Christianity. 

\* This expresses into messages we get on a Sunday are filtered through what we the audience will tolerate to hear.
