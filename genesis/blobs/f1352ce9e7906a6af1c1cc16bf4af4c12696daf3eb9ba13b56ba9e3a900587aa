Scenario: Municipal health care access and coordination
    Given Margaret has changing health needs with aging
    And she navigates complex health care systems
    When the municipality_elohim coordinates health access
    Then municipal health programs should be accessible
    And senior health clinics should be available and affordable
    And navigation support should help Margaret access care
    And preventive health should be prioritized for seniors
    And municipal health policy should support senior wellness
    And Margaret should be able to age healthily in community
