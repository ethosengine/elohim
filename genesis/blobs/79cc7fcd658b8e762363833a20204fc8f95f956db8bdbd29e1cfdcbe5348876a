Scenario: Maintaining independence through effective resource management
    Given Margaret values her independence
    And she wants to avoid becoming "a burden"
    When Margaret uses the Value Scanner over time
    Then it should help her maintain self-sufficiency
    And it should optimize her resources for maximum independence
    And it should connect her to community resources without stigma
    And it should make her care contributions visible
    And Margaret should experience continued agency and autonomy
    And the system should support her in aging on her own terms
