Scenario: Testifying to National Constitutional Council on policy needs
    Given National Council reviewing case with policy implications
    And they request my perspective as policy maker
    When I testify about legislative context
    Then I explain: existing law and its limitations
    And I describe: policy challenges protocol helps address
    And I clarify: how council precedent would affect legislation
    And I don't advocate: for particular constitutional interpretation
    And I inform: their deliberation with policy expertise
    And I demonstrate: collaboration between sortition and representative democracy
