Scenario: Emergency support through student community networks
    Given Kenji faces unexpected crisis (medical emergency, financial shortfall, housing instability)
    And formal institutions often respond too slowly
    When student community provides emergency support
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate rapid mutual aid
    And it should help students pool resources for peer emergency
    And it should recognize emergency care as high-value contribution
    And it should track "Maya loaned Kenji $100 for urgent medical cost"
    And community should function as immediate safety net
    And student mutual aid should provide crisis intervention
