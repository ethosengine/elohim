Scenario: Worker council makes strategic decisions about business direction
    Given corporate previously mandated menu, pricing, and suppliers
    And workers now govern these strategic decisions democratically
    When Emma proposes direct relationships with local farmers
    Then worker council deliberates on supply chain transition
    And workers analyze cost/benefit of local vs. corporate sourcing
    And workers vote on adopting Johnson Farm as primary vegetable supplier
    And the decision is implemented immediately
    And menu adapts to seasonal availability from democratic supplier relationships
