Scenario: Professional care work valued in care economy framework
    Given Sarah's teaching is professional care work
    And care economy should recognize professional caregiving
    When Sarah's care contributions are tracked
    Then her professional teaching should count as care labor
    And it should be valued alongside household care
    And Sarah should see her career as care economy participation
    And professional care workers should be recognized explicitly
    And care economy should include paid care work, not just unpaid
