Scenario: Making both partners' retirement care contributions visible
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity
    And his wife contributes different care labor to family and community
    And both provide substantial unpaid care work
    When the household_elohim tracks contributions
    Then both partners' care work should be quantified specifically
    And volunteer labor, family care, and community participation should be valued
    And invisible labor imbalances should become visible
    And both Frank and his wife should see who's doing what
    And data should support equitable distribution conversations
    And both partners' contributions should be recognized and celebrated
