Scenario: Part-time work integrated with care economy understanding
    Given Jasmine's income from work is part of her broader economic participation
    And she also contributes unpaid household labor and community volunteering
    When her personal_agent aggregates her economic activity
    Then it should integrate paid work with other care contributions
    And show that her economic life includes market and non-market work
    And help her understand comprehensive view of her economic participation
    And recognize that unpaid care work is as valuable as paid work
    And build sophisticated understanding that economy is broader than paid employment
    And internalize care economy framework as normal economic thinking
