Scenario: Documenting industry-wide exploitation patterns
    Given low wages and poor conditions are systemic across food service
    When the protocol aggregates data from workers across the industry

    And make visible that individual workplace problems are systemic
    And provide evidence for industry-level policy advocacy
    And demonstrate need for sector transformation
