Scenario: Accessing neighborhood time-banking system
    Given neighborhood operates time-banking for service exchange
    And I accumulate time credits through my work and contributions
    When I need services I cannot afford to purchase
    Then the protocol should connect me to time-banking opportunities
    And help me exchange my labor/skills for needed services
    And facilitate reciprocal care economy without money exchange
    And recognize that care economy can operate beyond cash
