Scenario: Household care tokens reflect both partners' contributions
    Given both Sarah and her partner contribute to household
    And contributions are currently very unequal
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then they should reflect actual labor performed
    And Sarah's 75% contribution should yield 75% of household tokens
    And tokens should give standing in household resource decisions
    And economic equity should follow labor equity
    And care contributions should determine household governance power
    And the partner should understand that tokens reflect actual work
