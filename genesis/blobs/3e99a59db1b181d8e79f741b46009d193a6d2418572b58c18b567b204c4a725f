Scenario: Democratic workplace implements innovation suggested by worker
    Given Emma has identified a workflow optimization
    And corporate system previously prohibited worker-initiated changes
    When Emma proposes the optimization at worker council meeting
    Then workers deliberate on implementation feasibility
    And workers vote to pilot Emma's optimization for two weeks
    And results are measured and shared transparently
    And if successful, Emma's innovation is permanently adopted
    And Emma receives recognition and compensation for the contribution
