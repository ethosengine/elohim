Scenario: Teacher connects resource allocation to learning outcomes
    Given district allocates resources based on administrative priorities
    And claims all schools receive equitable support
    When teachers document resource-outcome patterns through Observer
    Then teachers show schools with counselors have better student wellbeing
    And smaller class sizes correlate with better learning outcomes
    And arts programs predict higher engagement and graduation rates
    And teacher professional judgment is validated by student outcome data
    And resource allocation becomes student-centered not administratively convenient
