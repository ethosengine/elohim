Scenario: Preventing single parent burnout through community monitoring
    Given Maria operates at unsustainable intensity with no co-parent relief
    And burnout is extremely common among solo parents
    When the community_elohim monitors Maria's well-being
    Then it should detect warning signs of approaching burnout
    And it should proactively offer respite care and support
    And it should coordinate community intervention before crisis occurs
    And burnout prevention should be community responsibility
    And Maria should have community safety net watching for her well-being
