Scenario: Navigating family judgment and stigma about my circumstances
    Given some family members judge me for leaving, for being "difficult," for accessing assistance
    And I am vulnerable to internalizing family shame and blame
    When family members express stigmatizing attitudes
    Then the family_elohim helps me recognize and resist family stigma
    And validates that leaving abuse was right and necessary
    And provides supportive reframing of stigmatizing narratives
    And helps me set boundaries with judgmental family members
    And connects me to peer support from others who understand
    And my personal_agent reminds me that my choices were brave and appropriate
    And recognizes resisting family judgment as emotional labor
    And supports my right to distance from unsupportive family
