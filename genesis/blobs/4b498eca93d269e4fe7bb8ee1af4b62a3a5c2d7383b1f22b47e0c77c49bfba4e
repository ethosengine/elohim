    Given James's family invested $400K supporting his franchise dream
    And they took real risk and deserve fair treatment
    When acquisition provides $150K return after debt repayment
    Then family receives back substantial portion of investment
    And return reflects their risk and support over five years
    And family can choose to reinvest in community investment pool if desired
    And family investors appreciate dignified resolution protecting workers and James
    And workplace_elohim ensures family investor treatment is transparent and fair
