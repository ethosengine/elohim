    Then it should identify community needs matching his construction expertise
    And it should coordinate Habitat projects utilizing his specific skills
    And it should suggest neighborhood repair opportunities
    And it should facilitate mentoring younger workers
    And it should help him teach construction workshops
    And Frank should experience his knowledge as community asset
