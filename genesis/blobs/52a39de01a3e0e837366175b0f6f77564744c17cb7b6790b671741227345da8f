Scenario: Elder care support shared across neighborhood
    Given Robert's parents visit regularly and will eventually need local care
    And several neighbors are also managing elder care
    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates elder care support
    Then it should connect neighbors managing similar challenges
    And facilitate sharing of resources, knowledge, and respite
    And surface: "Three neighbors use the same home health agency—could coordinate for better rates"
    And build neighborhood capacity to support aging residents
    And prevent isolation for those managing elder care
    And create mutual support network for common challenges
    And strengthen neighborhood through shared caregiving
