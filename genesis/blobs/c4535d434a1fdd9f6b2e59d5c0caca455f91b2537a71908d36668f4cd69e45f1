Scenario: After-school programs for Keisha accessed through care tokens
    Given Marcus's sister Keisha needs care while Marcus shops
    And after-school programs exist in the community
    When care coordination needs are identified
    Then Marcus's family should access programs through care token economy
    And his care contributions should subsidize Keisha's program costs
    And care economy should coordinate care needs across community
    And Marcus's burden should be reduced through community support
    And reciprocity should frame the exchange, not charity
    And community care should support his family's flourishing
