Scenario: Family support coordinated without undermining Alex's independence
    Given Alex sometimes needs support from family members
    And family might conflate providing support with having authority
    When family provides assistance to Alex
    Then support should flow with full respect for Alex's autonomy
    And family should provide help Alex requests, not help they think Alex needs
    And Alex should maintain decision-making authority
    And the family_elohim should structure relationships to protect Alex's agency
    And offering help should never imply Alex is incapable
    And interdependence should be normalized, not pathologized
    And family support should strengthen, not undermine, Alex's independence
