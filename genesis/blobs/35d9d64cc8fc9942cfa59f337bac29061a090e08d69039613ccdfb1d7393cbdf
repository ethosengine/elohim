Scenario: Advance care planning supported by community resources
    Given Helen is planning for end of life
    And advance care planning is complex
    When Helen accesses community advance planning support
    Then the community_elohim should connect her to counseling resources
    And her advance directives should be documented in accessible format
    And her wishes should be communicated across care networks
    And community should support death with dignity
    And the protocol should enable agency over end of life
    And Helen's values should guide her death as they guided her life
    And community care economy should extend through end of life
