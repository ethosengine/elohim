Scenario: Neighborhood council member understands local conditions for district advocacy
    Given neighborhood has concerns about park maintenance and safety
    And council wants to advocate to city parks department for improvements
    And needs data to support request competing with other neighborhoods
    When the council member uses Observer hyperlocal analysis
    Then they receive documentation of park condition deterioration over time
    And see usage data showing high community demand despite poor conditions
    And access comparison to park investment in other neighborhoods
    And get demographic analysis showing environmental justice dimensions
    And hyperlocal data strengthens advocacy to broader governance levels
