Scenario: Extended family care reciprocity across generations
    Given Sarah's parents provided care for her as a child
    And she's now providing care to them as they age
    When multi-generational care patterns are tracked
    Then the family_elohim should recognize reciprocal care flows
    And care should be seen as flowing both ways across time
    And Sarah's care for parents should be valued
    And parents' previous care for Sarah should be acknowledged
    And multi-generational reciprocity should be visible
