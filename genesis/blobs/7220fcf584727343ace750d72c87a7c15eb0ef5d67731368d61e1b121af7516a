Scenario: Journalist develops worker sources on retaliation
    Given workers face retaliation for organizing or complaining
    And fear job loss for speaking to journalist
    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel
    Then workers share evidence of retaliation and illegal firings
    And journalist investigates without exposing individual sources
    And aggregates worker experiences to show pattern
    And verifies claims through labor board records
    And publishes investigation protecting sources while exposing employer
    And source protection enables workers to speak truth
