Scenario: Developing abstract thinking through real economic complexity
    Given Marcus is in developmental phase of emerging abstract thought
    And he manages genuinely complex resource coordination
    When Marcus plans meals and budgets across time
    Then he should be developing advanced cognitive capabilities

    And the personal_agent should support abstract reasoning development
    And complex adult work should accelerate cognitive maturation
    And educational scaffolding should support his emerging abstraction
