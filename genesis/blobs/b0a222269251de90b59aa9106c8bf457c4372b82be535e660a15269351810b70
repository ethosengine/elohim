Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained even for young child
    Given Tommy has been using the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Tommy or his parents choose to disconnect
    Then the system must honor the disconnection immediately
    And no data retention beyond legal requirements should occur
    And Tommy's right to not participate must be respected
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
