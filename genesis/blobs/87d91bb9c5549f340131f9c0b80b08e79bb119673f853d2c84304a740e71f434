Scenario: Investor capital enables community programs addressing neighborhood needs
    Given traditional investment extracts value from communities
    And Patricia wanted investment supporting community benefit, not extraction
    When democratic business allocates revenue to community programs
    Then her investment enables senior meal programs, youth employment, community space
    And investment returns include social dividends: stronger community, less isolation, economic opportunity
    And capital builds community infrastructure, not just individual wealth
    And social returns are documented and valued alongside financial returns
    And community_elohim manages community program funding from democratic business revenue
