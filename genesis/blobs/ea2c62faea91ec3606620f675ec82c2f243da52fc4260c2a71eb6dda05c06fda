Scenario: Journalist monitors 12 civic bodies with comprehensive surveillance
    Given the journalist is sole reporter covering city hall
    And must cover city council, planning, housing, transit, and 8 other bodies
    When the Observer monitors all municipal meetings simultaneously
    Then the journalist reviews every meeting that happened this week
    And receives alerts prioritizing newsworthy decisions
    And searches across all bodies for patterns and connections
    And comprehensive municipal coverage replaces selective attention
    And one reporter with Observer infrastructure outperforms pre-crisis newsroom
