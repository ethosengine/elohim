Scenario: Training Constitutional Council members on technical literacy
    Given new council members need technical foundations
    And I contribute to their 3-week training program
    When I teach about AI systems and cryptographic verification
    Then I provide: conceptual understanding without overwhelming detail
    And I enable: critical engagement with technical testimony
    And I avoid: indoctrination about "correct" technical approaches
    And I develop: their capacity to question experts
    And I empower: them to judge despite not being specialists
    And I demonstrate: how ordinary citizens can govern complex technology
