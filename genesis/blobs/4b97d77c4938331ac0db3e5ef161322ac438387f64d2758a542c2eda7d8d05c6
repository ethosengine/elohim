Scenario: Legislator monitors state agency implementation across departments
    Given the politician passed legislation affecting multiple agencies
    When the Observer tracks implementation statewide
    Then they see which agencies comply with legislative intent
    And identify bureaucratic resistance to policy changes
    And understand regional variation in policy implementation
    And learn where additional legislative oversight is needed
    And ensure legislative authority translates to executive action
