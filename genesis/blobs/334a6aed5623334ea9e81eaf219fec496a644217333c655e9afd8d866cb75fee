Scenario: Scheduling personal time with cognitive support
    Given Jordan wants to plan their weekend activities
    When Jordan opens the schedule planner
    Then the interface shows time visually (morning/afternoon/evening pictures)
    And activity options appear as large icons with simple labels
    And the system guides Jordan step-by-step ("What do you want Saturday morning?")
    And Jordan can select activities they enjoy (park, movies, friends)
    And the personal_agent helps coordinate support if needed
    And Jordan's schedule reflects their genuine choices
    And Jordan maintains decision-making authority
