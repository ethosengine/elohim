Scenario: Teacher tracks board member voting patterns
    Given teachers need to identify genuine board allies
    And can't easily track votes across meetings
    When the Observer tracks and analyzes board member votes
    Then teachers see which members consistently support teaching conditions
    And identify which members prioritize administrative recommendations over teacher input
    And can target advocacy to persuadable members
    And recognize true allies for coalition building
    And board accountability becomes visible and actionable
