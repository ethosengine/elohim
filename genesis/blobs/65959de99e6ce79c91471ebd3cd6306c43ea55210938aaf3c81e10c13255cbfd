Scenario: Special education or support service coordination across siblings
    Given one or more of Maria's children may need educational support services
    And she must coordinate any special needs alone across multiple children
    When children require special education services or support
    Then the educational_elohim should help Maria coordinate across children and schools
    And schools should recognize she's managing support needs without co-parent
    And scheduling of meetings and services should accommodate her work constraints
    And single parents should receive extra support for complex special education navigation
    And Maria should be able to advocate effectively for children's needs despite time limitations
