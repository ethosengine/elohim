Given crises may threaten protocol infrastructure
And rapid response funding is needed
When I establish emergency reserves
Then I fund: rapid scaling for refugee crises
And I support: attack response against corporate or authoritarian threats
And I provide: disaster recovery for damaged infrastructure
And reserves ensure: protocol survives shocks
And resilience: is built into national support
And democratic governance: can weather emergencies
