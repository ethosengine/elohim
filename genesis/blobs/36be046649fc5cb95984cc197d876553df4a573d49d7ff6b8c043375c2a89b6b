Scenario: Teaching adult children care economy principles through modeling
    Given Frank's adult children are watching his care contributions
    And he's modeling post-employment care economy participation
    When family_elohim surfaces care patterns
    Then it should help Frank teach care economy to next generation
    And adult children should see that contribution continues through retirement
    And they should learn that care flows across generations
    And Frank's example should prepare them for their own aging
    And care reciprocity should be transmitted generationally
    And family care culture should strengthen through visible modeling
