Scenario: Food assistance programs accessed without stigma
    Given Helen's $24k/year barely covers basic needs
    And she needs food assistance to survive
    When Helen accesses food programs through care economy
    Then assistance should be presented as legitimate reciprocity
    And no stigma should attach to receiving support
    And her lifetime of contributions should frame current assistance
    And food access should be coordinated through community_elohim
    And dignity should be preserved throughout assistance
    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy eliminates charity model
    And Helen should receive support as right based on contributions, not as failure
