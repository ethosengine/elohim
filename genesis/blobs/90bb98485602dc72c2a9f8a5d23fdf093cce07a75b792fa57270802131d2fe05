Scenario: Student generation as agents of ecological transformation
    Given Kenji's generation will inherit climate crisis and ecological breakdown
    And students are developing patterns that will shape future
    When the bioregional_elohim recognizes generational context
    Then it should validate student ecological anxiety and grief
    And it should empower students as agents of ecological transformation
    And it should support collective action for systemic change
    And it should recognize that care economy is ecological imperative
    And the system should foster student leadership in ecological care
    And Kenji's generation should be empowered to build ecological care economy
