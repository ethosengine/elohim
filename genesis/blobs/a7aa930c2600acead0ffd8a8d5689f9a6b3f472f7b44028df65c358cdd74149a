Scenario: Preserving developmentally appropriate family structure
    Given Marcus has adult-level responsibilities
    And he is still a 12-year-old child
    When family dynamics are shaped by care economy
    Then the family_elohim should work to preserve appropriate boundaries
    And Marcus should not become de facto parent
    And Sarah should remain ultimate authority and protector
    And age-appropriate childhood should be preserved where possible
    And the protocol should prevent role reversal damage
    And family structure should remain as healthy as circumstances allow
