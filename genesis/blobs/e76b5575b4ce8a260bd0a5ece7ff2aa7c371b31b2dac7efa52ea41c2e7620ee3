Scenario: Making both partners' care contributions visible
    Given Sarah performs meal planning, shopping, cooking, child coordination
    And her partner performs other household labor
    And much of this work is invisible in traditional economics
    When the household_elohim tracks contributions
    Then both partners' care work should be quantified specifically
    And invisible labor imbalances should become visible
    And Sarah and partner should see who's doing what
    And data should replace resentment in household discussions
    And visibility should enable fair distribution negotiations
