Scenario: Preventing teacher burnout through care economy recognition
    Given Sarah faces high burnout risk as teacher
    And teacher care work is undervalued and underpaid
    When the educational_elohim tracks Sarah's teaching labor
    Then her care contributions should be quantified and visible
    And she should gain language to advocate for fair compensation
    And recognition should support her professional sustainability
    And care economy should help prevent teacher burnout
    And visibility should enable Sarah to maintain teaching career
