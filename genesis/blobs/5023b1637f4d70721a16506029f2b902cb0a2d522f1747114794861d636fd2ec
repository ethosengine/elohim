Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates subsidy effectiveness
    Given a responsible developer builds genuinely affordable housing
    And uses state subsidies to serve low-income residents
    When the Observer tracks development outcomes against state investment
    Then analysis shows: 180 units meet affordability criteria from $8M subsidy
    And residents are actually low-income workforce families
    And units remain affordable through long-term deed restrictions
    And state investment created genuine community benefit
    And responsible development gains advantage in subsidy allocation
