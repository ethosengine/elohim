Scenario: Workers welcome community stakeholder input while maintaining decision autonomy
    Given community investors funded the EAE acquisition
    And investors want input on community benefit priorities
    When annual community stakeholder meeting occurs
    Then investors and customers share priorities and concerns
    And workers listen to community input respectfully
    And workers deliberate on community suggestions democratically
    And workers maintain final decision authority on operations
    And community_elohim ensures investors cannot override worker governance
    And balanced stakeholder participation serves everyone
