Scenario: Community accountability for supporting families
    Given communities depend on families raising next generation
    And Sarah's parenting work benefits entire community
    When the community_elohim tracks community support for families
    Then it should measure whether community is adequately supporting parents
    And it should identify gaps in family resources and support
    And it should create accountability for community investment in children
    And the system should ensure communities reciprocate for parent contributions
    And care economy should make community obligations to families visible
    And the community should be accountable for enabling parent success
