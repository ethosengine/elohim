Scenario: Single parent representation in school governance and decision-making
    Given single parents have specific needs and perspectives
    And they are often underrepresented in school governance due to time constraints
    When schools form parent councils or governance bodies
    Then the educational_elohim should facilitate single parent participation
    And schools should make governance accessible to time-constrained parents
    And single parent voices should inform school policies
    And Maria should be able to contribute to school governance despite constraints
    And educational policy should reflect single-parent family realities
