Scenario: Homeschooling recognized as full educational provision
    Given some parents provide complete education at home
    And homeschooling is intensive educational labor
    When the educational_elohim tracks homeschooling work
    Then it should recognize full-time teaching by parents
    And homeschooling should accumulate substantial care tokens
    And the system should value parent-provided education fully
    And homeschooling parents should have economic support for educational work
    And care economy should recognize diverse educational approaches
    And parent teaching should be valued regardless of institutional setting
