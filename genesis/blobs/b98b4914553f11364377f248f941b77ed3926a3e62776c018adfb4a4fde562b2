Scenario: Managing children's relationships with extended family during crisis
    Given my children have relationships with grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins
    And these relationships may be supportive, complicated, or harmful
    When I coordinate children's extended family contact
    Then the family_elohim helps me facilitate healthy family relationships
    And supports me in limiting or supervising problematic relationships
    And tracks children's responses to different family members
    And helps me explain family situations to children age-appropriately
    And coordinates family involvement in children's lives appropriately
    And my personal_agent alerts me to concerning family dynamics
    And recognizes my facilitation of children's family relationships as care work
    And validates my right to protect children from harmful family dynamics
