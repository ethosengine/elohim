Scenario: Assessing whether national protocol standard violates constitution
    Given appellant challenges nationwide implementation standard
    And National Council must evaluate technical conformance
    When I audit national protocol against constitutional principles
    Then I examine: whether implementation drifted from constitutional alignment
    And I verify: cryptographic proofs across national deployment
    And I identify: systematic technical issues affecting millions
    And I assess: whether correction is feasible
    And I provide: honest evaluation even if unflattering to protocol
    And I serve: truth-telling and constitutional accountability
    And my independence: enables genuine oversight
