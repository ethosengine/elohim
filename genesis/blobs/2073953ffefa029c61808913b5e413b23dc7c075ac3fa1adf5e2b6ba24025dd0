Scenario: Protecting disability community from institutional harm
    Given institutions often harm disabled people systematically
    And Alex advocates against institutional ableism
    When Alex works to protect disability community from harm
    Then this protective advocacy should be recognized as care work
    And the community_elohim should track Alex's watchdog activities
    And preventing harm is as valuable as providing support
    And Alex's work defending community rights should accumulate tokens
    And the protocol should value both defensive and generative care work
    And Alex's advocacy prevents suffering at scale
    And community protection should be appropriately compensated
