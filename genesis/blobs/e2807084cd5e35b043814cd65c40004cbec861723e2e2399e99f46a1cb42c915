Scenario: Activist coordinates neighborhood tenant association
    Given multiple tenants face similar landlord issues
    And the activist is organizing tenant power
    When the Observer facilitates secure coordination
    Then tenants can connect without landlord surveillance
    And see patterns across different units and buildings
    And coordinate collective bargaining for repairs
    And track landlord compliance with commitments
    And individual tenant struggles become collective action
