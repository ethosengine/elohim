Scenario: Individual identity protected amid overwhelming care demands
    Given Robert's care responsibilities could consume all available time
    And he risks losing individual identity to caregiver role
    When Robert's personal_agent monitors his wellbeing
    Then it should protect space for his own flourishing
    And flag if care demands are eliminating personal time
    And surface when he needs rest, recreation, or personal development
    And recognize: "You haven't had time for yourself in 17 days"
    And help him understand that his own wellbeing enables sustainable care
    And validate that maintaining individual identity is not selfishness
    And support him in setting boundaries that preserve his personhood
