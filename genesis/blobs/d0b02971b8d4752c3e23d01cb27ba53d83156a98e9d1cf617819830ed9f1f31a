Scenario: Responsible developer leverages positive track record
    Given a responsible developer delivered promised benefits in three past projects
    And competes against extractive developer with misleading claims
    When the Observer makes track records visible
    Then the responsible developer's history shows: jobs delivered matched projections
    And community benefits were actually built and maintained
    And environmental commitments were kept
    And positive reputation becomes competitive advantage
    And integrity creates market differentiation
