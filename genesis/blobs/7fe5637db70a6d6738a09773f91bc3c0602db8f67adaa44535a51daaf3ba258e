Scenario: Organizer documents opportunity gap for education equity campaign
    Given gifted programs concentrate in predominantly white schools
    And advanced placement courses lack availability in low-income schools
    When the Observer provides education equity data
    Then the organizer sees enrichment program distribution across district
    And maps demographic patterns showing systematic disparities
    And calculates opportunity gaps affecting thousands of students
    And identifies organizing base of affected families
    And educational inequality becomes documented basis for organizing
