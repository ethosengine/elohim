Scenario: Cross-cultural appeal about universal human dignity
    Given my community's practices were deemed unconstitutional by agent
    And we believe our cultural values are being unfairly judged
    When National Constitutional Council reviews the cultural conflict
    Then they engage deeply with cultural relativism vs universal minimums
    And They distinguish genuine cultural diversity from human rights violations
    And They consider if constitutional framework reflects dominant culture bias
    And They examine if subsidiarity allows cultural variation in this domain
    And They create precedent protecting cultural diversity within dignity bounds
    And My appeal strengthens constitutional respect for cultural pluralism
    And Universal human dignity is upheld without cultural imperialism
