Scenario: Household budget management with severe resource constraint
    Given Helen's $24k/year income barely covers necessities
    And household expenses are challenging on fixed income
    When the household_elohim manages budget tracking
    Then it should help Helen navigate financial limitations
    And priority should be given to keeping her housed
    And community resources for home maintenance should be surfaced
    And no shame should attach to needing financial assistance
    And the system should connect her to care economy support
    And assistance should flow as reciprocity, not charity
    And Helen's ability to remain in her home should be prioritized
