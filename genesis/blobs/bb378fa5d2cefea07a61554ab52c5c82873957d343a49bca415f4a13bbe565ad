Scenario: Municipal economic development metrics evolve to measure democratic ownership
    Given cities measure economic development by job quantity, not quality
    And Patricia's investments create high-quality jobs (living wages, ownership, voice)
    When community investors demonstrate democratic ownership benefits
    Then municipal metrics include: worker ownership rates, wage levels, democratic governance participation
    And economic development success is measured by community wealth-building
    And democratic conversions score highly on quality-focused metrics
    And policy priorities shift toward job quality through investor advocacy
    And municipality_elohim provides democratic economy measurement framework
