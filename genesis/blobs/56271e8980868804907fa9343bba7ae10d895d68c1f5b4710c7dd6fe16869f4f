Scenario: Transparent boundaries that Emma can understand and learn from
    Given Emma operates within parental boundaries
    And she is old enough to understand limits
    When Emma encounters a boundary (allergen, budget, nutrition)
    Then the boundary should be explained transparently
    And the agent should say "This exceeds the family budget we're working within"
    And Emma should see and understand the limits
    And boundaries should be teaching tools, not just restrictions
    And she should learn that all autonomy operates within contexts
    And transparency should build understanding of constraint reasoning
