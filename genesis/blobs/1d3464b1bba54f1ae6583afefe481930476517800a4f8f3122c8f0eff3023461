    Given some students need educational accommodations
    And accommodations require advocacy and coordination
    When students access disability services
    Then the educational_elohim should support accommodation advocacy
    And it should recognize student labor of managing accommodations
    And it should value disability services as institutional care work
    And accommodation should be understood as educational care economy
    And the system should support equitable access to education
    And disability justice should be core to educational care economy
