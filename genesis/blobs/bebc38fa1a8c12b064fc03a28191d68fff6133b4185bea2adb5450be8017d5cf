Scenario: Franchise operator network emerges supporting democratic conversions
    Given franchise operators are typically isolated competing for corporate favor
    And isolation prevents collective action against corporate extraction
    When James connects with other operators considering conversion

    And coordinated multi-operator conversions increase leverage in corporate negotiations
    And operator-to-operator mentoring spreads democratic conversion knowledge
