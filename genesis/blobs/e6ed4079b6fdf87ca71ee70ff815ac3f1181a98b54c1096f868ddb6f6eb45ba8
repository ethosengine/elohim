Scenario: Parental oversight balances with expanding child autonomy
    Given Emma has more freedom than Tommy
    And she still needs parental guidance at age 8
    When Emma makes independent scanner decisions
    Then Sarah should have full visibility into Emma's choices
    And Sarah should maintain ultimate authority
    And Emma's autonomy should be genuine within parental bounds
    And the balance should protect both safety and capability development
    And Sarah should be supported in letting go appropriately
    And trust should grow as Emma demonstrates judgment
