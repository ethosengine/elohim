Scenario: Building household resilience through cooperation
    Given shared households can pool resources and reduce individual burden
    When we practice care economy cooperation
    Then the protocol should help us maximize mutual benefit
    And identify opportunities for efficiency through sharing
    And support us in building household community
    And demonstrate that cooperative care reduces costs and increases well-being
