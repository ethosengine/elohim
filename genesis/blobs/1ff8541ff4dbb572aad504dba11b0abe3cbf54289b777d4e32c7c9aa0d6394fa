Scenario: School board member surfaces parent and teacher concerns at scale
    Given the politician hears from vocal parents at board meetings
    But suspects broader community has different priorities
    When the Observer aggregates parent and teacher input
    Then they see working parents can't attend evening meetings
    And learn teachers face classroom supply shortages systematically
    And identify parent concerns about mental health resources
    And understand transportation reliability affects family schedules
    And align policy with broader community needs beyond meeting attendees
