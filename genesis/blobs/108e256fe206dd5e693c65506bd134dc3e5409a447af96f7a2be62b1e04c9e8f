Scenario: Transportation choices and ecological impact
    Given Kenji walks most places due to lack of car
    And walking has minimal ecological impact
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks transportation
    Then it should recognize walking as ecological care contribution
    And it should accumulate care tokens for low-impact transportation
    And it should show "Walking instead of driving prevented X carbon emissions"
    And it should validate that poverty can align with ecological values
    And the system should recognize low-impact mobility as care work
    And Kenji should see his car-free life as ecological stewardship
