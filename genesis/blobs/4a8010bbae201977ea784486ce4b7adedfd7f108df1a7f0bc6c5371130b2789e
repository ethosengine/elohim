Scenario: Community investment enables farm democratic conversion and expansion
    Given Tom wants to convert farm to worker ownership but farmworkers lack capital
    And community members want to support local agriculture but lack pathway
    When community investment pool funds farm acquisition and expansion
    Then neighbors invest $2K-$20K each in democratic farm conversion
    And investors receive fair return (5% annually) plus food security benefit
    And farm gains capital for sustainable infrastructure and expansion
    And community builds ownership stake in local food production
    And community_elohim manages community investment in farm democratization
