Scenario: Lifetime contributions create legitimate claims on community support
    Given Helen has contributed to community for 60+ years of adult life
    And she now requires substantial assistance
    When Helen accesses community care resources
    Then her care tokens should reflect decades of contribution
    And community support should be framed as reciprocity
    And she should not experience shame about needing help
    And assistance should flow as legitimate return on lifetime of giving
    And the community_elohim should make her contribution history visible
    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy honors lifetime reciprocity
    And Helen should experience dignity, not charity
