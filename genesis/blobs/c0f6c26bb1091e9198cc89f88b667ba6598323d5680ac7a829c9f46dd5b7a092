Scenario: Journalist exposes corruption through pattern recognition
    Given a developer receives zoning variances in three meetings
    And each approval seems procedurally normal in isolation
    When the Observer tracks developer across all city bodies
    Then the journalist sees developer got 8 variances in 18 months
    And identifies campaign donations to council members before each vote
    And finds same developer denied variances in other cities for violations
    And documents revolving door between planning staff and developer
    And publishes investigation exposing systematic corruption
