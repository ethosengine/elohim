Scenario: School board member distinguishes authentic parent concern from coordinated campaign
    Given the politician receives mass emails opposing curriculum
    And messages claim widespread parent outrage
    When the Observer analyzes campaign origins
    Then they see template messages from national advocacy organization
    And identify 15 local parents among 300 emails
    And distinguish coordinated political campaign from genuine community concern
    And understand actual parent sentiment in district
    And resist manipulation by outside political organizations
