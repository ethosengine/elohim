Scenario: Family history and care patterns made visible across generations
    Given care patterns often repeat across generations
    And Robert learned care from his parents' care for their parents
    And he's modeling care for the next generation
    When family_elohim surfaces family care history
    Then it should help Robert see multigenerational care patterns
    And recognize: "Your parents provided similar care for your grandparents"
    And surface how his current care teaches his children
    And connect past care received to present care given to future care needed
    And help family understand care as lifecycle reciprocity
    And validate that Robert's care continues family care traditions
    And prepare next generation to provide care when Robert needs it
