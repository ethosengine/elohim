Scenario: Parent tracks board accountability for promises
    Given the school board promised to address transportation by Q2
    And the parent's child still has unreliable dangerous bus service
    When three months pass without action on the commitment
    Then the Observer alerts parent about broken promise
    And provides exact quote from February board meeting
    And shows which board members made the commitment
    And parent raises specific accountability question publicly
    And board commitments to families persist despite turnover
