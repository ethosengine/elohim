Scenario: Community resource allocation prioritizes aging in place
    Given community resources are limited
    And policy choices affect elder care
    When community governance makes allocation decisions
    Then the community_elohim should surface elder needs
    And aging in place should be prioritized over institutionalization
    And Helen's voice should be included in community decisions
    And resources should flow to enable dignity-preserving care
    And the protocol should inform community policy
    And care economy data should demonstrate what elders need to flourish
    And community should invest in infrastructure that serves all ages
