Scenario: Garden and food growing knowledge shared across generations
    Given Margaret may grow some of her own food
    And gardening knowledge is both ecological and practical
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates food growing
    Then Margaret's gardening should be recognized as care contribution
    And growing food reduces industrial agriculture dependence
    And her knowledge should be shared with neighbors and family
    And community gardens should connect seniors with others
    And food growing should be supported as ecological practice
    And Margaret's skills should strengthen community food security
