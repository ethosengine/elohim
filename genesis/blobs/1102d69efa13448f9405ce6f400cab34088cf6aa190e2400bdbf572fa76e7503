Scenario: Care contributions during family visits
    Given Aisha visits her family home periodically
    And she provides substantial care labor during visits
    When Aisha cooks, shops, and helps with household tasks
    Then the family_elohim should track her visit contributions
    And cooking, shopping, and household help should all be valued
    And her care work should be visible to the family
    And recognition should validate her adult contributions
    And family visits should be understood as care labor, not just leisure
    And care tokens should reflect the value she provides
