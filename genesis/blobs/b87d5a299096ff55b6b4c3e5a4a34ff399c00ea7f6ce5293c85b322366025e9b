Scenario: Household labor distribution made visible
    Given Aisha does most of the cooking
    And her roommate does most of the cleaning
    When household care contributions are tracked
    Then the household_elohim should make all labor visible
    And it should show time invested by each person
    And it should recognize different forms of household care
    And invisible work should receive equal recognition
    And the system should prevent exploitation through transparency
    And household equity should be data-informed
