Scenario: Foundation for lifelong value literacy begins at age 5
    Given Tommy is forming foundational beliefs about economics
    And early learning shapes lifelong patterns
    When Tommy completes the Pure Discovery phase
    Then he should have internalized that care creates value
    And he should understand that his choices matter to others
    And he should experience himself as capable care contributor
    And he should expect technology to serve human flourishing
    And he should have alternative to consumer capitalism as baseline
    And his generation should grow up assuming care economy is normal
