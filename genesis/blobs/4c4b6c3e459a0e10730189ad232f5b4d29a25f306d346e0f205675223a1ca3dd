Scenario: Maintaining hope and forward vision despite overwhelming present

    And it's easy to lose hope when drowning in impossible demands
    When the personal_agent provides long-term perspective
    Then it should help Maria see beyond today's crisis
    And it should remind her that children grow and demands will eventually shift
    And it should celebrate progress and acknowledge her endurance
    And it should maintain realistic hope without minimizing current struggles
    And Maria should be supported in keeping vision of a sustainable future
