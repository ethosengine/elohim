Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult
  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to participate in community governance as both participant and leader
  So that I can leverage my accumulated experience to shape care economy systems and mentor the next generation

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the middle-aged user "Robert" is registered in the system
    And Robert is 52 years old with decades of professional and care experience
    And the community governance context is active
    And community_elohim coordinates community care economy
    And Robert has accumulated substantial care contributions and social capital

  Scenario: Community leadership positions recognize accumulated care experience
    Given Robert has decades of care economy participation
    And he has demonstrated capability through managing complex responsibilities
    And community needs experienced leadership
    When community_elohim identifies leadership opportunities
    Then it should recognize Robert's accumulated care contributions as leadership qualification
    And surface opportunities: community boards, policy advisory roles, initiative leadership
    And connect his care experience to governance credibility
    And help him understand that his lived experience is valuable wisdom
    And match leadership opportunities to his capacity and interests
    And prevent exploitation of middle-aged adults' sense of responsibility
    And support meaningful community contribution without burnout

  Scenario: Community care policy advocacy informed by personal experience
    Given Robert manages multigenerational care and work-life balance
    And he's learned what community systems help and what fails
    And policy could be improved based on his experience
    When community_elohim connects him to policy advocacy
    Then it should surface opportunities to influence care economy policy
    And help him translate personal experience into policy recommendations
    And connect him to boards, councils, and advocacy organizations
    And recognize that his voice matters because he's lived the complexity
    And support him in advocating for elder care resources, work-family policies, and care infrastructure
    And channel his accumulated wisdom toward system improvement
    And demonstrate that care economy includes policy transformation

  Scenario: Mentoring younger adults in care economy navigation
    Given Robert has learned to navigate work-care balance over decades
    And younger adults are earlier in their journey

    Then it should connect Robert with younger adults seeking guidance
    And recognize his mentoring as valuable care contribution
    And support him in sharing knowledge about care economy practices
    And help younger generation learn from his experience
    And value his mentoring in community care tokens
    And prevent him from being exploited for free emotional labor
    And build intergenerational knowledge transfer

  Scenario: Community resource coordination supports multigenerational care
    Given Robert coordinates care across multiple generations
    And community resources exist but are hard to navigate
    And he needs eldercare support, young adult resources, and family services

    Then it should connect Robert to relevant community support services
    And surface eldercare programs for his parents
    And identify young adult support programs for his children
    And connect him to caregiver support groups
    And reduce time spent researching and coordinating resources
    And demonstrate that community infrastructure should serve caregivers
    And make visible the resources built through care economy

  Scenario: Community governance voice weighted by care contributions
    Given Robert has made substantial care contributions over decades
    And his care work demonstrates community investment
    When community_elohim supports governance participation
    Then his accumulated care contributions should give him standing
    And his voice in community decisions should reflect his investment
    And governance processes should actively solicit his input
    And his experience managing complexity should be valued in community planning
    And care tokens should connect to community governance participation
    And demonstrate that care economy participation creates civic voice
    And prevent governance dominated by those without care experience

  Scenario: Community care economy education delivered by experienced practitioners
    Given Robert has decades of care economy participation
    And many community members don't understand care economy principles
    And his experience makes him credible educator
    When community_elohim identifies education opportunities
    Then it should connect Robert to community education initiatives
    And recognize him as qualified to teach care economy practices
    And support him in leading workshops, presentations, or courses
    And value his teaching as community care contribution
    And help community members learn from practitioners, not just theorists
    And build community care economy literacy through peer education
    And demonstrate that care economy spreads through experienced advocates

  Scenario: Community networks provide backup support for care crises
    Given Robert manages complex care demands that could face crisis
    And care crises happen: parent hospitalization, child emergency, personal illness
    And community networks could provide emergency support
    When community_elohim builds crisis resilience
    Then it should connect Robert to community members who could help in crisis
    And identify backup support for his various care responsibilities
    And ensure he's not isolated when crisis hits
    And recognize that his care contributions create reciprocal crisis support
    And build community resilience through mutual aid networks
    And demonstrate that care economy participation provides safety net
    And prevent care crisis from becoming catastrophic

  Scenario: Community care infrastructure advocacy based on user needs
    Given Robert uses community care services and sees gaps
    And he understands what infrastructure would help families like his
    And community planning should be informed by user experience
    When community_elohim connects user experience to infrastructure planning
    Then it should channel Robert's feedback to community planning processes
    And surface gaps: "No adult day care available for aging parents in this community"
    And help him advocate for infrastructure that serves caregivers
    And connect his voice to community decision-makers
    And ensure community care systems are designed by those who use them
    And build care infrastructure based on actual caregiver needs
    And demonstrate that users should shape systems

  Scenario: Community leadership balanced with existing care demands
    Given Robert has capacity for community contribution
    And community leadership opportunities are abundant
    And he also carries substantial family and work responsibilities
    When community_elohim coordinates his community participation

    And prevent over-commitment that would overwhelm him
    And surface when community demands exceed healthy boundaries
    And support him in choosing leadership roles that match his capacity
    And recognize that sustainable participation requires limits
    And prevent community from exploiting his sense of responsibility
    And support meaningful contribution without burnout

  Scenario: Community care economy connects personal and collective transformation
    Given Robert participates in care economy personally
    And his position enables him to influence broader systems
    And personal and systemic change reinforce each other
    When community_elohim supports his participation
    Then it should help him see connections between personal care and system change
    And surface opportunities to advocate professionally for care economy principles
    And support him in spreading care economy through his networks
    And recognize that his generation can drive mainstream adoption
    And help him leverage professional, economic, and political position

    And demonstrate that personal practice and systemic advocacy work together

  Scenario: Community intergenerational connection facilitated by middle-aged bridge
    Given Robert connects to multiple generations: children, peers, parents
    And he understands needs and perspectives across age ranges
    And community thrives through intergenerational connection
    When community_elohim leverages his intergenerational position
    Then it should recognize him as bridge between generations
    And support him in facilitating intergenerational community programs
    And help younger and older community members connect through him
    And value his translation between generational perspectives
    And build community cohesion through intergenerational care
    And demonstrate that middle-aged adults uniquely enable community integration
    And strengthen community through lifecycle diversity

  Scenario: Community participation builds resources for Robert's own aging
    Given Robert is preparing for his own eventual care needs
    And community participation now builds networks for later
    And care economy operates on long-term reciprocity
    When community_elohim helps Robert plan for aging
    Then it should help him see that current community participation builds future support
    And recognize that relationships now will remain as he ages
    And surface how care tokens accumulate toward future care
    And support him in building community that will serve his aging
    And demonstrate that care economy investment pays forward
    And help him prepare for aging with dignity through community connection
    And recognize that community care is lifecycle reciprocity
