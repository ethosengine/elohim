Scenario: Municipal recreation and social programs prevent elder isolation
    Given Frank needs social connection to maintain wellbeing
    And isolation increases with age without intentional connection
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates social infrastructure
    Then it should provide programs connecting retired residents
    And senior centers should be framed as community hubs, not warehouses
    And programs should facilitate continued contribution and purpose
    And Frank should access social connection through municipal infrastructure
    And elder isolation should be prevented through public programs
    And municipal policy should recognize social connection as health infrastructure
