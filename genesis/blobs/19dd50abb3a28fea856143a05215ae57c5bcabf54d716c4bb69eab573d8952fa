Scenario: Collaborating with national research on protocol effectiveness
    Given Dr. Chen studies national sortition governance patterns
    And my technical expertise complements his social science
    When we collaborate on research
    Then I explain: technical mechanisms enabling democratic oversight
    And I help: interpret technical aspects of council decisions
    And I provide: data on agent behavior patterns
    And I respect: his expertise on social and political dynamics
    And we integrate: technical and democratic perspectives
    And collaboration produces: richer understanding than either alone
    And research serves: evidence-based governance improvement
