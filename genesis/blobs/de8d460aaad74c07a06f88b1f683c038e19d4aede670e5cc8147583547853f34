Scenario: Fair compensation accounting for care work burden
    Given Sarah performs enormous unpaid care labor
    And this work subsidizes employer by enabling her professional work
    When Sarah negotiates compensation
    Then the workplace_elohim should help her articulate fair pay
    And it should recognize that low wages force families into poverty
    And it should support advocacy for family-sustaining compensation
    And the system should help Sarah argue that fair pay enables family care
    And workplace should pay wages that support household flourishing
    And compensation should reflect total value of human labor
