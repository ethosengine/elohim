Scenario: Organizer builds worker-community coalition for living wage
    Given workers can't afford housing in city where they work
    And residents care about economic stability of their communities
    When the organizer uses Observer to build coalition
    Then they connect low-wage workers with community advocates
    And show how poverty wages harm both workers and neighborhoods
    And coordinate testimony combining worker lived experience and community impact
    And facilitate coalition across four languages and multiple industries
    And labor organizing becomes community economic justice campaign
