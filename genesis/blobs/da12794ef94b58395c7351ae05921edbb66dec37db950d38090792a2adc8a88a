Scenario: Neighborhood economic circulation increases through distributed ownership
    Given Rosa's profit ($40K annually) left the neighborhood for her personal use
    And value extraction limited community benefit despite Rosa's generosity
    When democratic ownership distributes value throughout community
    Then worker wage increases ($14 → $18/hour) circulate in neighborhood economy
    And community programs receive dedicated funding from value circulation
    And workers spend locally, supporting other neighborhood businesses
    And multiplier effects amplify as spending cascades through community
