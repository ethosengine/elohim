Scenario: Recognition of substantial disability advocacy contributions
    Given Alex performs significant disability advocacy work
    And Alex mentors other disabled people in their community
    And Alex does accessibility consulting for local organizations
    And this sophisticated care labor benefits entire communities
    When the Value Scanner tracks Alex's care contributions
    Then advocacy work should accumulate care tokens appropriately
    And peer mentoring should be recognized as skilled care labor
    And accessibility consulting should be valued explicitly
    And community organizing should count toward care economy standing
    And Alex's substantial contributions should be made visible
    And society should see Alex as contributor, not burden
    And Alex's care work should shape their economic standing
