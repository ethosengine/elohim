Scenario: Planning personal development despite time constraints
    Given I have skills and interests beyond my current job
    And employment leaves minimal time for personal development
    When I want to learn new skills or pursue interests
    Then the protocol should help me find micro-opportunities
    And connect me to accessible learning resources
    And recognize that my growth and flourishing matter
    And support me in maintaining identity beyond worker role
