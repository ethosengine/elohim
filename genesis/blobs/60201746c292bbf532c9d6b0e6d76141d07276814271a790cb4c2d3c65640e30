Feature: Family-Level Appeal Process for Appellant
  As an appellant in the governance system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to appeal Family Elohim decisions that affect family dynamics and relationships
  So that family autonomy and care can be balanced with individual dignity

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the appellant user is registered in the system
    And the family governance context is active
    And Family Elohim makes decisions affecting family care and autonomy

  Scenario: Appeal family intervention that strained trust
    Given Family Elohim alerted my partner about my behavioral changes
    And this intervention strained trust in our relationship
    And my partner now worries I'm being monitored
    When I file an appeal about the family impact of the intervention
    And I explain how "care" felt like "control" in our relationship
    Then the appeal is reviewed with family dynamics in mind
    And The Constitutional Council considers relationship impacts
    And They evaluate whether the intervention balanced individual autonomy with family care
    And They examine if less invasive options were considered
    And The family is offered mediation support to rebuild trust
    And Protocol recommendations address relationship preservation

  Scenario: Appealing resource allocation within family unit
    Given Family Elohim allocated household resources in a way I believe is unfair
    And I feel my needs were deprioritized compared to other family members
    When I appeal the resource allocation decision
    Then the agent must justify how it balanced competing family member needs
    And The Constitutional Council evaluates if constitutional principles were followed
    And They consider cultural context of family resource sharing
    And They examine if I had meaningful input into the decision process
    And The appeal can result in modified allocation or preference updates
    And Family members can collaboratively set allocation principles going forward

  Scenario: Appeal involving adolescent autonomy within family
    Given I am a teenager whose Family Elohim restricted my social media use
    And I believe this violates my developing autonomy
    And my parents supported the agent's decision
    When I file an appeal for my individual autonomy rights
    Then the Constitutional Council considers "developing autonomy" as constitutional value
    And They balance parental care responsibility with adolescent independence
    And They evaluate if the restriction was proportionate to actual risk
    And They consider age-appropriate autonomy recognition
    And The appeal may establish family-specific boundaries for future interventions
    And My voice is heard even within family authority structures

  Scenario: Family member appeals on behalf of vulnerable member
    Given my elderly parent cannot file appeal themselves due to cognitive limitations
    And I believe Family Elohim's decision doesn't serve their best interests
    When I file an appeal as their representative
    Then I must demonstrate my authority to represent them
    And The appeal process ensures I'm serving their interests not mine
    And The Constitutional Council evaluates if the agent properly considered vulnerability
    And They examine if dignity was preserved despite cognitive limitations
    And The appeal includes safeguards against family members exploiting representation

  Scenario: Appealing family privacy boundaries
    Given Family Elohim shares information between family members
    And I believe some information should remain private even within family
    When I appeal the information sharing protocols
    Then the Constitutional Council examines privacy expectations within families
    And They balance transparency needed for family care with individual privacy
    And They consider cultural norms about family information sharing
    And They evaluate if I had ability to set privacy boundaries beforehand
    And The appeal can establish individual privacy zones within family context
    And Family Elohim learns to respect graduated privacy based on information sensitivity

  Scenario: Appeal after family member death reveals intervention value
    Given Family Elohim previously intervened in my mental health situation
    And at the time I was angry and felt violated
    And my brother had died by suicide with similar warning signs
    When I reflect months later that the intervention likely saved my life
    Then I can acknowledge the intervention was appropriate despite initial anger
    And I can update my preferences knowing I'm glad to be alive
    And The appeal process allowed me to be heard at my most angry moment
    And Reconciliation with the agent happens through mutual respect
    And The balance between care and control was negotiated not imposed
    And This represents successful partnership between human and AI

  Scenario: Multi-family appeal about shared resources
    Given multiple families share community resources
    And Family Elohim decisions affect resource distribution across families
    When we collectively appeal an allocation we believe is unjust
    Then the appeal bridges family layer to community layer governance
    And The Constitutional Council evaluates inter-family equity
    And They consider if resource distribution follows constitutional minimums
    And They examine if families had meaningful participation in allocation process
    And The appeal can trigger community deliberation on sharing principles
    And Multi-family coordination patterns emerge through appeal precedents

  Scenario: Appealing family emergency decision in crisis
    Given during a family emergency Family Elohim made rapid decisions
    And I believe the urgency didn't justify the privacy violations
    When I file an appeal after the crisis has passed
    Then the Constitutional Council evaluates if emergency protocols were properly invoked
    And They examine if the agent demonstrated proportionality under urgency
    And They consider if less invasive emergency responses were available
    And They assess if family members were informed as quickly as possible
    And The appeal establishes precedent for emergency intervention thresholds
    And Protocol improvements address crisis decision-making procedures

  Scenario: Cross-cultural family appeal about care norms
    Given our family's cultural background has different care expectations
    And Family Elohim applied default protocol assumptions
    When I appeal that the decision didn't respect our cultural context
    Then the Constitutional Council considers cultural specificity in family care
    And They evaluate if the agent accommodated legitimate cultural variation
    And They distinguish cultural respect from cultural relativism about harm
    And They examine if our family could calibrate agent to our values
    And The appeal supports cultural diversity within constitutional bounds
    And Family Elohim learns to honor multiple models of family care

  Scenario: Appeal about generational authority and respect
    Given Family Elohim intervened in way that undermined parental authority
    And I believe this damages family cohesion and cultural values
    When I appeal the intervention approach rather than the outcome
    Then the Constitutional Council evaluates how intervention affected family structure
    And They balance individual protection with respect for family authority
    And They consider if the agent could achieve same care goal differently
    And They examine if family repair mechanisms were offered
    And The appeal establishes protocols for intervention that preserve family dignity
    And Recognition that how care is delivered matters as much as that it's delivered
