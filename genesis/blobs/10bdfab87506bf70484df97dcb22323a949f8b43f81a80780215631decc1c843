Scenario: Genuinely accessible interface enables full participation
    Given Alex needs to use the Value Scanner
    And Alex has limited fine motor control
    When Alex opens the Value Scanner
    Then the interface should support voice commands fully
    And it should be compatible with Alex's screen reader
    And keyboard navigation should work for all functions
    And visual settings should be customizable for contrast and size
    And the interface should be forgiving with error recovery
    And accessibility should be built-in, not retrofitted
    And Alex should experience the system as designed for them
    And universal design principles should be evident throughout
