Scenario: Journalist grounds state education policy in local school impacts
    Given state legislature debates education funding formula
    And the journalist covers state education policy
    When the Observer shows local impacts across specific districts
    Then the journalist sees how formula change affects 230 individual schools
    And identifies which communities gain or lose funding
    And contacts affected teachers, parents, and students in specific districts
    And publishes story connecting state policy to lived local experiences
    And policy journalism serves communities not just political class
