Scenario: Neighborhood conflict resolution supported by care economy data
    Given neighbors sometimes have conflicts
    And disputes can damage neighborhood cohesion
    When neighborhood conflicts arise
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should provide context from care patterns
    And it should show each party's contributions to neighborhood
    And it should facilitate resolution based on mutual care
    And conflicts should be addressed before they escalate
    And care economy should support neighborhood harmony
