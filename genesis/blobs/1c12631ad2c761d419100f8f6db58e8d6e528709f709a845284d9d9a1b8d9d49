Scenario: Protecting protocol sovereignty from state overreach
    Given state government attempts regulation compromising protocol
    And I believe this violates community sovereignty
    When I advocate for protecting local autonomy
    Then I testify: at state legislative hearings
    And I coalition: with other community leaders
    And I present: evidence that regulation would harm local governance
    And I defend: subsidiarity principle and community choice
    And I resist: one-size-fits-all mandates from higher layers
    And I maintain: that communities adopted protocol voluntarily
    And I protect: democratic self-governance
