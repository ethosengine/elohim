Scenario: Sharing care work across sibling network
    Given siblings may have different capacities for family care
    And my work schedule limits my hands-on participation
    When the family needs ongoing care coordination
    Then the protocol should help distribute care work fairly
    And recognize that my employment constraints affect availability
    And identify where I can contribute given my limitations
    And support negotiation toward equitable family care distribution
