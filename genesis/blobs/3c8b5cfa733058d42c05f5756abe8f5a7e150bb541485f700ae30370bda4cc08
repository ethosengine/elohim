Scenario: Bioregional investment coordination supports local sustainable supply chains
    Given sustainable supply chains require coordination across bioregion
    And Patricia's investment in Maria's Kitchen connects to Johnson Farm investment
    When investment pool coordinates bioregional supply chain development
    Then farm-to-restaurant supply chains are financed as integrated systems
    And bioregional food miles decrease through local sourcing infrastructure
    And investment supports entire sustainable supply chain, not isolated enterprises
    And ecological benefits compound through bioregional coordination
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates supply chain investment across bioregion
