    Given district promised improved special education services
    And the organizer's coalition of parents won the commitment

    And sees resource allocation to special education programs
    And receives alerts when implementation lags behind timeline
    And documents wins to show parents their advocacy worked
    And district learns parent organizing demands follow-through
