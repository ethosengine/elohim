Scenario: National survey research on public trust and legitimacy
    Given I need to understand population-wide attitudes toward protocol
    And survey data provides breadth that case studies cannot
    When I conduct nationally representative survey on protocol governance
    Then I measure: trust in agents vs trust in traditional institutions
    And I assess: perceived legitimacy of Constitutional Councils
    And I explore: what predicts individual support or opposition
    And I examine: demographic patterns in trust and participation
    And I track: opinion changes over time as protocol matures
    And I identify: sources of resistance and paths to broader acceptance
    And My research informs: public engagement and communication strategies
