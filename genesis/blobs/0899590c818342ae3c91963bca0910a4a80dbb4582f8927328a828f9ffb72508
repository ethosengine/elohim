Scenario: Grappling with my influence on decisions affecting millions
    Given my testimony shapes National Council decisions
    And those decisions affect millions of people
    When I reflect on the weight of my responsibility
    Then I feel: burden of expertise influencing democratic governance
    And I worry: about errors in my analysis causing harm
    And I accept: that I must act under uncertainty
    And I commit: to honesty about my limitations
    And I trust: democratic process to weigh my input appropriately
    And I practice: epistemic humility while still providing expertise
    And I demonstrate: expertise serving democracy despite uncertainty
