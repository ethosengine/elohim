Scenario: Performance evaluation recognizes whole-person contribution
    Given Robert's professional performance should be evaluated fairly
    And care responsibilities shouldn't be seen as professional liability
    And his care skills enhance his professional effectiveness
    When workplace_elohim supports performance evaluation
    Then it should advocate for evaluation that recognizes whole-person contribution
    And help Robert articulate how care responsibilities develop professional capability
    And surface when evaluation processes penalize caregiving
    And support him in documenting productivity and value creation
    And build evaluation frameworks that value care skills
    And prevent caregivers from being passed over for advancement
    And demonstrate that fair evaluation includes care economy perspective
