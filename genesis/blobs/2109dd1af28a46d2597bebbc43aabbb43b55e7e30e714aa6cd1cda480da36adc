    Given corporate extraction left minimal resources for community benefit
    And neighborhood needed senior support, youth employment, community space
    When democratic businesses allocate 30% of revenue to community programs
    Then Ms. Johnson accesses subsidized senior meals (sliding scale pricing)
    And neighbors' youth gain employment with dignity and ownership pathway
    And community space is available for organizing and mutual aid
    And her patronage funds programs benefiting entire neighborhood
    And community_elohim manages community benefit distribution ensuring equity
