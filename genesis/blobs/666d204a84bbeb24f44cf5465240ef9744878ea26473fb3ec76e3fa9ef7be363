Scenario: Identity preserved through memory challenges
    Given Helen's dementia causes increasing memory difficulties
    And her sense of self needs support and continuity
    When her personal_agent interacts with her over time
    Then it should help maintain her identity continuity
    And it should reference her history: "You worked as a teacher for 30 years"
    And it should support her self-concept despite cognitive changes
    And it should remind her of relationships and accomplishments
    And her personhood should remain intact even as memory fades
    And the protocol should serve the human being she remains
    And dignity should be preserved regardless of cognitive capacity
