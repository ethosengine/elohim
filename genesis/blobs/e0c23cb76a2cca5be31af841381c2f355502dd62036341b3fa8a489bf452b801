Scenario: Politician surfaces worker priorities beyond business lobby
    Given the politician hears from business groups on labor policy
    But limited direct contact with worker constituents
    When the Observer aggregates worker constituent input
    Then they see workers prioritize healthcare access and paid sick leave
    And identify childcare costs as barrier to workforce participation
    And understand workplace safety concerns in specific industries
    And learn wage theft affects significant worker population
    And align labor policy with worker constituent needs
