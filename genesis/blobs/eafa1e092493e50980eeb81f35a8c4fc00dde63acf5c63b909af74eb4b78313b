Scenario: Teacher coordinates statewide advocacy against testing mandate
    Given state proposes expanding standardized testing requirements
    And testing already narrows curriculum and stresses students
    When teachers coordinate through Observer across districts statewide
    Then 3,200 teachers sign onto collective advocacy campaign
    And provide testimony on how testing burdens harm learning
    And build coalition with parents experiencing test stress
    And present evidence from states that reduced testing
    And collective professional voice creates political pressure
    And state testing policy becomes contested not inevitable
