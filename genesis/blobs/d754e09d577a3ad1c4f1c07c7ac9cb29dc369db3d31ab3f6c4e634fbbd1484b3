Scenario: Biodiversity preservation is integrated into agricultural practice
    Given industrial agriculture destroys biodiversity through monoculture and chemicals
    And biodiversity loss threatens ecosystem resilience and pollination
    When democratic farms prioritize biodiversity as ecological value
    Then pollinator habitat is planted and protected across farms
    And hedgerows and field margins support wildlife and beneficial insects
    And native plant species are incorporated into farm landscapes
    And biodiversity increases measurably through democratic agricultural stewardship
