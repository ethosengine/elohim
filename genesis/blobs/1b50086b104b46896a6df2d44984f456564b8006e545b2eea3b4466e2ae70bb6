Scenario: Family privacy protects Alex from unwanted disclosure
    Given Alex's disability status is sensitive information
    And some family members might share Alex's private information
    When family members access shared family systems
    Then Alex should control what information family can access
    And the family_elohim should prevent unauthorized disclosure
    And Alex's medical information should never be shared without consent
    And family should not be able to discuss Alex's private matters in shared spaces
    And privacy violations should be prevented systematically
    And Alex should be protected from family gossip or oversharing
    And confidentiality should be enforced even within family
