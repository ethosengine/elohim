Scenario: Workplace exploitation flagged and resources provided
    Given Jasmine's employer violates labor laws
    And she is asked to work off the clock
    When workplace_elohim detects the violation
    Then it should flag the exploitation to Jasmine
    And explain that this is illegal and not acceptable
    And provide resources about reporting labor violations
    And connect her to worker advocacy organizations
    And support her in addressing the problem
    And protect her from accepting exploitation as normal
    And demonstrate that care economy includes protecting workers from harm
