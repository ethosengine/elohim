Scenario: Teacher evaluates state education funding formula
    Given state funding formula determines district resources
    And formula appears complex and technical
    When the Observer analyzes state funding impacts
    Then teachers see their district gets $8,500 per student
    And neighboring district gets $12,000 per student from same formula
    And understand which formula factors create disparities
    And learn which legislators champion funding equity
    And coordinate with underfunded districts for reform coalition
    And education funding becomes teacher advocacy priority
