Scenario: Navigating workplace power dynamics
    Given employers have significant power over workers
    And I may fear retaliation for advocating for my needs
    When I need to navigate workplace advocacy carefully
    Then the protocol should help me understand my protections
    And provide strategies for advocacy that minimize retaliation risk
    And connect me with legal resources if needed
    And support me in exercising my rights despite power imbalance
