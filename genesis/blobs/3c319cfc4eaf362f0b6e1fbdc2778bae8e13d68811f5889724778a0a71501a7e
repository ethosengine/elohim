Scenario: Teacher grounds curriculum debate in professional knowledge
    Given the school board debates curriculum approaches
    And discussion is dominated by political ideology not educational evidence
    When teachers contribute professional expertise through Observer
    Then board receives aggregated teacher insights on effective curriculum
    And teachers provide research evidence on curriculum approaches
    And share classroom examples of what actually works for students
    And connect curriculum to actual student learning outcomes
    And education policy discussion becomes evidence-based and professional
