Scenario: Family financial support recognition as care contribution
    Given James's household income has plummeted due to caregiving
    And family members may provide financial assistance
    When family financial support is tracked
    Then the family_elohim should recognize financial help as care contribution
    And it should value financial support alongside direct care labor
    And family members unable to provide direct care can contribute financially
    And care economy should include multiple forms of contribution
    And financial support should be recognized, not taken for granted
