Scenario: Community cultural events and intergenerational connection
    Given communities thrive on cultural connection and celebration
    And Sarah wants children integrated into community life
    When the community_elohim coordinates cultural events
    Then it should facilitate family participation in community culture
    And it should recognize Sarah's work bringing children to events
    And cultural transmission should be valued as care labor
    And intergenerational community events should be prioritized
    And the system should build community bonds across generations
    And family participation should strengthen community cohesion
