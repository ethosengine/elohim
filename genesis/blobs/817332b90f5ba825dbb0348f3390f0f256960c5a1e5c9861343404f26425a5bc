Scenario: Household privacy maintained while coordinating with extended family
    Given Robert and Jennifer coordinate with Robert's siblings on parent care
    And they communicate with adult children about support
    And they participate in community care economy
    When household_elohim manages information sharing
    Then it should protect household privacy while enabling coordination
    And share parent care information with Robert's siblings appropriately
    And keep household financial details private from extended family
    And allow children to access relevant information without full household visibility
    And ensure community sees care contributions without sensitive details
    And support household autonomy while enabling family coordination
