Scenario: Parent challenges harmful discipline policies
    Given the school implements zero-tolerance discipline policy
    And the parent's child has been suspended for minor incident
    When the parent reviews Observer's discipline data
    Then they see suspension rates and disparate racial impacts
    And learn about restorative justice alternatives
    And discover other parents whose children face similar treatment
    And understand policy alternatives from other districts
    And parent coalition advocates for evidence-based discipline reform
