Scenario: Teacher tracks administrator promises
    Given the principal promised to reduce paperwork burden
    And six months have passed
    When the Observer tracks promise implementation
    Then teachers document paperwork actually increased 15%
    And evidence shows gap between promise and reality
    And teachers bring accountability data to next site council
    And administrator either delivers on commitment or explains why not
    And promises become enforceable through transparency
