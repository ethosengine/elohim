Feature: Neighborhood Layer Community Integration for Elderly
  As an elderly person in the value scanner system
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to remain embedded in my neighborhood with dignity
  So that I am connected to local community rather than isolated

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elderly user "Helen" is registered in the system
    And Helen has lived in her neighborhood for 40 years
    And Helen's mobility limitations affect neighborhood participation
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local support networks

  Scenario: Neighbors checking on elderly without surveillance feeling
    Given Helen lives alone and neighbors are concerned
    And informal neighborhood care networks exist
    When neighbors check on Helen's wellbeing
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate wellness checks
    And neighbors should be guided to check naturally: "Saw you haven't been out"
    And Helen should experience concern, not surveillance
    And her privacy should be respected
    And neighborhood care should feel organic, not institutional
    And connection should preserve dignity
    And the protocol should facilitate genuine community care

  Scenario: Elderly person's neighborhood contributions made visible
    Given Helen has contributed to neighborhood for decades
    And she still participates in community memory-keeping
    When Helen shares neighborhood history
    Then her contributions should be recognized by neighborhood_elohim
    And neighbors should see that Helen still gives to community
    And her knowledge of neighborhood history should be valued
    And care tokens should reflect her ongoing contributions
    And she should experience herself as valued neighbor, not burden
    And the protocol should make visible that care flows both ways
    And longtime residents should have standing based on accumulated contributions

  Scenario: Local business accessibility for elderly with mobility limitations
    Given Helen needs to access local shops and services
    And her mobility limitations make some businesses inaccessible
    When the neighborhood_elohim assesses accessibility
    Then it should surface which local businesses are accessible
    And it should encourage accessibility improvements
    And it should coordinate volunteer support for inaccessible locations
    And Helen should be able to participate in neighborhood commerce
    And local economy should include elderly residents
    And the protocol should advocate for universal accessibility
    And neighborhood should adapt to enable elder participation

  Scenario: Neighborhood watch supports elderly safety with dignity
    Given Helen is vulnerable to scams and exploitation
    And neighborhood watch includes elder protection
    When potential threats are identified
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should alert Helen and support network
    And protection should be provided without infantilizing
    And Helen should be informed: "Neighbors are seeing scam calls in the area"
    And her autonomy should be preserved while providing protection
    And neighborhood should look out for vulnerable members
    And safety should be communal responsibility
    And the protocol should enable neighborhood care without surveillance

  Scenario: Walking assistance from neighborhood volunteers
    Given Helen's mobility makes walking difficult
    And she needs assistance to remain active in neighborhood
    When neighborhood volunteers offer walking support
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate volunteer schedules
    And volunteers should be matched based on availability and compatibility
    And Helen's preferences should guide volunteer matching
    And volunteer care work should be recognized with care tokens
    And Helen should experience companionship, not charity
    And the protocol should build reciprocal neighbor relationships
    And neighborhood support should enable continued engagement

  Scenario: Local events adapted for elderly participation
    Given neighborhood events are important for community connection
    And Helen's limitations affect her ability to participate
    When neighborhood events are planned
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should advocate for accessibility
    And events should include seating, accessible locations, and quiet spaces
    And transportation should be coordinated for those with mobility limits
    And Helen should be able to participate in neighborhood life
    And adaptation should enable, not separate
    And the protocol should ensure elderly inclusion in community events
    And neighborhood culture should include all ages and capabilities

  Scenario: Intergenerational neighborhood connections maintain elder standing
    Given Helen interacts with neighbors of all ages
    And longtime residents have neighborhood wisdom
    When neighborhood governance decisions are made
    Then Helen's voice should carry weight as longtime resident
    And her knowledge of neighborhood history should inform decisions
    And younger neighbors should be connected to Helen for wisdom
    And intergenerational relationships should be facilitated
    And the neighborhood_elohim should surface opportunities for elder mentoring
    And Helen should experience continued relevance in neighborhood life
    And the protocol should maintain elder standing in community

  Scenario: Emergency response coordinated through neighborhood networks
    Given emergencies may occur when Helen is alone
    And rapid response requires nearby support
    When emergency alert is triggered
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should contact nearby neighbors immediately
    And neighbors should be briefed on Helen's health conditions
    And her advance directives should guide neighbor response
    And network should be activated before or alongside 911
    And Helen should feel safe knowing neighbors will respond
    And the protocol should leverage proximity for emergency care
    And neighborhood networks should provide safety infrastructure

  Scenario: Aging in place supported by neighborhood care economy
    Given Helen wants to remain in her home and neighborhood
    And successful aging in place requires community support
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates care resources
    Then it should connect Helen to local support services
    And informal care networks should be strengthened
    And volunteer help should be matched to Helen's needs
    And Helen's accumulated contributions should create claims on support
    And care should flow as reciprocity, not charity
    And the protocol should demonstrate that neighborhoods can support aging in place
    And community care economy should enable elders to remain home

  Scenario: Local knowledge preservation through elderly memory keeping
    Given Helen remembers 40 years of neighborhood changes
    And this knowledge has cultural and practical value
    When neighborhood planning and decisions occur
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should surface Helen's historical knowledge
    And her memory of neighborhood patterns should inform planning
    And oral history should be captured for community archive
    And Helen should be recognized as neighborhood historian
    And her contribution to collective memory should be valued
    And the protocol should preserve local knowledge through elder participation
    And community memory should include longtime residents' perspectives

  Scenario: Snow removal and seasonal support coordinated through neighbors
    Given Helen cannot safely shovel snow or do seasonal maintenance
    And neighbors have varying capabilities and availability
    When seasonal support needs arise
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate volunteer schedules
    And neighbors should be matched to tasks based on capability
    And Helen should experience this as neighborly care, not charity
    And volunteer work should be recognized with care tokens
    And reciprocal support should be tracked across seasons
    And the protocol should coordinate practical mutual aid
    And neighborhood care economy should handle seasonal challenges

  Scenario: Transportation coordination enables neighborhood mobility
    Given Helen no longer drives
    And public transit is limited or inaccessible
    When Helen needs to get to local appointments or events
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate rides with neighbors
    And volunteer drivers should be matched based on schedule compatibility
    And Helen should maintain ability to participate in neighborhood life
    And transportation barriers should not cause isolation
    And driver care work should be recognized
    And the protocol should solve last-mile transportation through care economy
    And neighborhood networks should provide mobility infrastructure
