Scenario: Appeal reveals need for constitutional amendment
    Given my case reveals fundamental gap in existing constitutional framework
    And no amount of interpretation can adequately address the issue
    When National Constitutional Council deliberates my case
    Then they identify that constitutional amendment is needed
    And They document the gap and propose amendment language
    And My case becomes key example in amendment proposal
    And The proposal goes to next 7-year Global Constitutional Convention
    And My individual suffering contributes to constitutional evolution
    And Future humanity benefits from my struggle for justice
    And Constitution remains living document responsive to lived experience
