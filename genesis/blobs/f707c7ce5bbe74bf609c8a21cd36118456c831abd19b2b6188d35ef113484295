Scenario: School site council member advocates for resources from district
    Given school has aging facilities and overcrowded classrooms
    And site council wants district to prioritize school for capital improvements
    And needs to present compelling case competing with other schools
    When the council member uses Observer to prepare advocacy
    Then they receive documentation of facility conditions and capacity issues
    And see comparison to other district schools showing relative needs
    And access student outcome data linking conditions to learning impacts
    And get examples of how district allocated capital funds in past
    And evidence-based advocacy connects community needs to district decisions
