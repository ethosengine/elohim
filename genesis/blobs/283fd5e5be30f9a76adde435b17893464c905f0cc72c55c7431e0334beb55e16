Scenario: Food preservation skills as bioregional care contribution
    Given Margaret knows how to preserve food through canning, freezing, drying
    And food preservation reduces waste and builds food security
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food preservation
    Then Margaret's preservation labor should be quantified
    And skills should be recognized as ecological care contribution
    And preserved food reduces reliance on industrial food systems
    And Margaret's knowledge should be shared with community
    And traditional preservation techniques should be valued
    And bioregional food resilience should be strengthened by senior knowledge
