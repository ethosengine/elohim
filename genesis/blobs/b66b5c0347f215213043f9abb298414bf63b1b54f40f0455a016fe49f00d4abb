Scenario: Educational policy informed by teen care economy participation
    Given aggregate data shows how teens balance education with care work
    And many teens provide substantial household labor while in school
    When educational_elohim analyzes patterns across student populations
    Then it should surface insights about care work burden on students
    And inform educational policy about homework loads and scheduling
    And show how household responsibilities affect educational outcomes
    And advocate for policies that recognize student care economy participation
    And push schools to consider whole lives of students, not just academic performance
    And support evidence-based educational policy grounded in student realities
