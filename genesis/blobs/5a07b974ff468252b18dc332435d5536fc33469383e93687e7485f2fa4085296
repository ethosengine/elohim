Scenario: Municipal working parent policies informed by care economy data
    Given Sarah balances full-time work with parenting
    And municipal policy affects working parents' capacity to care
    When municipal employment policies are considered
    Then care economy data should show working parents' time constraints
    And policy should recognize workers' care responsibilities
    And municipal employers should adopt family-friendly policies
    And Sarah's advocacy should be strengthened by care economy evidence
    And municipal policy should support work-life integration
