# The Five Epics: A Map of Systemic Change

## Why Five Domains?

The Elohim Protocol doesn't try to solve everything at once. It identifies five interconnected domains where systemic change is both necessary and achievable. Each "epic" addresses a specific coordination failure while contributing to the whole.

Think of them as pressure points in the current system—places where targeted intervention can cascade into broader transformation.

## Overview of the Five Epics

### 🏛️ Epic 1: AI Governance

**The Problem**: AI systems increasingly shape our lives, but we have no democratic way to govern them.

**The Solution**: Constitutional frameworks for AI that distribute oversight across stakeholders, with explicit appeals processes and separation of powers.

**For policy makers**: This is the regulatory framework you've been looking for—one that actually works at AI speed.

**Key concepts**: Constitutional councils, separation of powers, appeals process, AI oversight

### 📊 Epic 2: Value Scanner

**The Problem**: Economic systems only see market transactions, missing the vast care economy that sustains society.

**The Solution**: Technology that makes invisible value visible—caregiving, mentorship, ecological stewardship—without forcing it into market logic.

**For content creators**: Imagine if the value you create for your community was actually recognized, not just your ad impressions.

**Key concepts**: Care economy, REA accounting, value flows, recognition systems

---

### 👁️ Epic 3: Public Observer

**The Problem**: Civic participation has been reduced to voting every few years while decisions happen behind closed doors.

**The Solution**: Continuous, contextual participation where affected stakeholders have voice and visibility into decisions that affect them.

**For influencers**: Your audience isn't just consumers—they're citizens who need better tools for collective action.

**Key concepts**: Transparency, civic participation, trust networks, observer protocol

---

### 🏢 Epic 4: Autonomous Entity

**The Problem**: Workplaces still operate like 19th-century hierarchies, while workers have 21st-century expectations.

**The Solution**: Distributed governance models that give workers genuine agency, supported by AI that serves their interests.

**For developers**: This is the DAO concept, but grounded in labor economics and worker experience.

**Key concepts**: Worker ownership, distributed governance, cooperative structures, workplace democracy

---

### 💬 Epic 5: Social Medium

**The Problem**: Social media optimizes for engagement, not wellbeing, fragmenting public discourse and extracting attention.

**The Solution**: Communication platforms designed around relationships and dignity, not advertising metrics.

**For everyone**: What if your social feed helped you flourish instead of addicting you?

**Key concepts**: Humane design, relationship-centered communication, moderation, digital dignity

## How the Epics Connect

These aren't separate initiatives—they're interdependent:

```
AI Governance ←→ All epics need AI oversight
     ↓
Value Scanner → Enables fair economic participation
     ↓
Public Observer → Provides transparency and accountability
     ↓
Autonomous Entity → Transforms how we organize work
     ↓
Social Medium → Transforms how we communicate
```

Each epic creates conditions for the others to succeed. Constitutional AI makes value scanning trustworthy. Value recognition enables worker agency. Civic participation legitimizes all the rest.

## Choosing Your Entry Point

You don't need to master all five epics. Start where your expertise and interest align:

- **Policy makers**: Start with AI Governance
- **Developers**: Start with Value Scanner or Autonomous Entity
- **Influencers/Creators**: Start with Social Medium or Public Observer
- **Everyone**: Start with whatever sparks your curiosity
