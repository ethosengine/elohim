Scenario: Teen provides sibling care as valued family contribution
    Given Jasmine provides regular after-school care for Jordan
    And this care enables parent Maya to work full-time
    And Jasmine's care work has substantial economic value
    When Jasmine's sibling care is tracked
    Then it should be valued as the labor it is, not dismissed as "just babysitting"
    And the care should be recognized in family care token allocation
    And Maya should receive prompts to explicitly acknowledge this contribution
    And Jordan should learn to recognize Jasmine's care work
    And the family should understand that Jasmine's care enables their current lifestyle
    And if external childcare would cost $15/hour, Jasmine's care should be valued accordingly
