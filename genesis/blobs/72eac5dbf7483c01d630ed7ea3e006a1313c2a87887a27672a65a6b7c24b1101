Scenario: Making retirement care contributions visible at individual level
    Given Margaret provides 15 hours/week grandchild care
    And she volunteers 10 hours/week in community
    And she provides 8 hours/week elder care for her mother
    When Margaret's care contributions are tracked
    Then her personal_agent should quantify all care labor
    And it should calculate market value (~$15k/year grandchild care)
    And it should accumulate care tokens for all contributions
    And it should make visible that she's highly productive
    And Margaret should experience herself as valuable contributor
    And the data should counter cultural narrative of retired as "not working"
    And her contributions should be recognized, not invisible
