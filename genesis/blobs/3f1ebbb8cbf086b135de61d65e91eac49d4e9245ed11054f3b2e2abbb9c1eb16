Scenario: Investor capital supports bioregional watershed protection
    Given water quality depends on land use throughout watershed
    And Patricia's investments affect and depend on watershed health
    When democratic businesses prioritize watershed stewardship
    Then farms implement water protection practices (buffer strips, reduced chemicals, wetland restoration)
    And investment compensates watershed stewardship through sustainability premiums
    And bioregional water quality improves through coordinated investment in sustainable practices
    And community benefits from clean water enabled by investment priorities
    And bioregional_elohim monitors watershed health and coordinates protection investment
