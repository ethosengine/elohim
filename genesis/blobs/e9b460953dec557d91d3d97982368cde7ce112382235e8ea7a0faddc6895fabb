Scenario: Advising National Council on fundamental constitutional tension
    Given National Council deliberates care vs privacy at constitutional level
    And technical capabilities shape what's constitutionally possible
    When I testify about technical constraints and possibilities
    Then I explain: what surveillance capabilities would enable better care
    And I clarify: technical limits on achieving privacy while providing protection
    And I present: tradeoff between optimization and dignity
    And I stop: before dictating which values should prevail
    And I inform: constitutional interpretation with technical reality
    And I respect: that council must choose values not just optimize outcomes
    And I demonstrate: expertise serving democratic judgment
