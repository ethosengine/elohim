Scenario: Industry investment patterns shift toward democratic enterprise financing
    Given traditional food service finance supports franchise expansion and corporate consolidation
    And democratic conversions need different investment structures (patient capital, community investment)
    When democratic food service conversions prove financially viable
    Then impact investors and CDFIs develop franchise-to-democratic conversion financing products
    And community investment pools proliferate to support local conversions
    And financial sector recognizes democratic food service as sound investment
    And capital availability for conversions increases, accelerating sector transformation
