Scenario: Challenging tipped wage systems
    Given tipped minimum wage is exploitative and creates instability
    When workers organize to eliminate tipped wage and demand full minimum wage
    Then the protocol should support advocacy for one fair wage
    And provide evidence of problems with tipped wage systems
    And help workers coordinate across tipped industries
    And push for legislative elimination of tipped wage carveouts
