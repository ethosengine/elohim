Scenario: Global research network coordinating cross-cultural studies
    Given protocol has been adopted in diverse nations worldwide
    And I am part of international research consortium
    When we coordinate parallel studies across continents
    Then we examine: how cultural context shapes constitutional interpretation
    And we compare: collectivist vs individualist societies' implementations
    And we analyze: different political systems' integration patterns
    And we identify: universal patterns vs cultural adaptations
    And we share: methodologies and data (with appropriate protection)
    And we test: whether democratic AI governance is Western innovation or universal possibility
    And Our global collaboration reveals: humanity's shared and diverse governance approaches
