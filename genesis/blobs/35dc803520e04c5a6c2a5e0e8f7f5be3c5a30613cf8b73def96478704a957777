Scenario: Accessing neighborhood resources for children's enrichment and development
    Given my children need activities, socialization, and development opportunities
    And money for activities is nonexistent
    When I seek enrichment opportunities for children in neighborhood
    Then the Value Scanner identifies free/low-cost neighborhood resources
    And surfaces library programs, parks, recreation centers, free community events
    And helps me access scholarship programs for children's activities
    And connects me to neighbors who organize children's activities
    And coordinates neighborhood childcare exchanges
    And my personal_agent tracks children's interests and matches to opportunities
    And recognizes resource navigation as substantial parenting labor
    And validates that I am providing rich childhood on no money
