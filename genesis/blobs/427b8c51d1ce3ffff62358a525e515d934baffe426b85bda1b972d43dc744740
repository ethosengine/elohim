Scenario: Identifying employment opportunities that are genuine versus exploitative
    Given some employers specifically target vulnerable people for exploitation
    And I am vulnerable to accepting exploitative work due to desperation
    When I evaluate employment opportunities
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me assess whether opportunities are exploitative
    And identifies red flags (unpaid "training", illegal pay practices, unsafe conditions, unrealistic expectations)
    And validates that I deserve fair employment, not exploitation
    And helps me decline opportunities that would harm my recovery
    And surfaces genuinely fair employment options
    And my personal_agent alerts me to concerning employer patterns
    And recognizes that protecting myself from exploitation is essential
    And supports me waiting for appropriate opportunity rather than accepting harm
