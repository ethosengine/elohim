Scenario: Community governance includes retired residents as active participants
    Given Frank and other retired residents have time for civic engagement
    And they have accumulated community knowledge and experience
    When the community_elohim facilitates governance
    Then it should actively include retired residents in decision-making
    And their time availability should enable substantial governance participation
    And their experience should inform community policy and planning
    And community decisions should benefit from elder wisdom
    And retired residents should be understood as governance resources, not dependents
    And Frank should participate in shaping community direction
