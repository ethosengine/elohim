Scenario: Teacher compares compensation across districts
    Given teacher salaries vary significantly across nearby districts
    And teachers lack comparative compensation information
    When the Observer analyzes teacher compensation regionally
    Then teachers see their district pays $8,000 below regional average
    And understand total compensation including benefits and workload
    And learn which districts have better contracts and why
    And use evidence in contract negotiations and recruitment crisis advocacy
    And compensation transparency drives labor market awareness
