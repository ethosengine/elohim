Scenario: Cross-cultural deliberation with radical diversity
    Given I am deliberating with citizens from radically different contexts
    And we have different languages, cultures, values, lived experiences
    When we work through constitutional questions together
    Then we rely on: skilled translation and cultural mediation
    And we practice: listening across profound difference
    And we identify: shared human concerns despite diversity
    And we navigate: disagreement with respect and curiosity
    And we discover: unexpected common ground
    And we honor: legitimate pluralism while seeking universal minimums
    And we demonstrate: humanity can deliberate together on existential questions
    And we embody: democratic hope for planetary governance
