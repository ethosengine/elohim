Scenario: Democratic governance enables farm innovation through worker collaboration
    Given individual owner structure limited innovation to Tom's ideas and capacity
    And workers had innovative ideas but no mechanism to implement them
    When democratic governance values all workers' innovative contributions
    Then cultivation technique improvements emerge from farmworker experimentation
    And workflow optimizations are tested and refined collaboratively
    And sustainable practice innovations spread through worker knowledge sharing
    And collective intelligence exceeds individual owner capacity
    And workplace_elohim documents innovations and shares across democratic farm network
