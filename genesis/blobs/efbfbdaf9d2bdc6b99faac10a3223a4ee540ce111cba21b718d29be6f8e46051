Scenario: Household decision-making about grandparenting commitments
    Given grandparenting commitments affect both household members
    And decisions should be made jointly
    When the family requests additional care or changes
    Then the household_elohim should facilitate joint decision-making
    And both Margaret and Robert should agree on care commitments
    And household should speak with one voice to family
    And care arrangements should serve household needs and capacity
    And neither partner should unilaterally commit to care
    And household governance should be respected by extended family
