Scenario: Journalist tracks state promises on infrastructure investment
    Given state announced major infrastructure funding 2 years ago
    And the journalist covered initial announcement
    When the Observer alerts on promise implementation timeline
    Then the journalist investigates actual spending and project completion
    And finds only 18% of promised funding has been allocated
    And sees projects concentrated in politically connected districts
    And documents communities still waiting for promised improvements
    And publishes accountability story on broken infrastructure commitments
