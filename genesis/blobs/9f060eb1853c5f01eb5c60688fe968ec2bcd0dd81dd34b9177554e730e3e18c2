Scenario: Reviewing my first appeal case with fellow council members
    Given Marcus appealed his Family Elohim's mental health intervention decision
    And I am reviewing this case with my diverse council
    When we deliberate on whether the agent followed constitutional bounds
    Then I bring: my nurse perspective on mental health and care
    And retired teacher brings: education and developmental insights
    And construction worker brings: working-class resource constraint understanding
    And grad student brings: research and analytical skills
    And business owner brings: economic and practical judgment
    And together we form: collective wisdom greater than any individual
    And we ask: "Did this demonstrate love as committed action?"
