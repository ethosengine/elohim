Scenario: Participating in community governance despite time constraints
    Given community makes decisions affecting workers' lives
    And my work schedule limits participation in governance
    When the community needs worker perspectives in decision-making
    Then the protocol should help me participate when possible
    And amplify worker voices in community governance
    And advocate for accessible participation structures for workers
    And ensure community decisions account for workers' needs
