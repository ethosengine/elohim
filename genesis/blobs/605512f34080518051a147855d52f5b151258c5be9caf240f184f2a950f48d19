Scenario: Managing municipal-level crisis affecting whole city
    Given city-wide emergency (flood, economic shock, public health crisis)
    And coordination across neighborhoods is critical
    When I coordinate municipal crisis response
    Then Municipal Elohim: helps identify needs and match resources rapidly
    And we enable: mutual aid flows across neighborhoods
    And we coordinate: with county and state for additional support
    And I maintain: human judgment on crisis priorities
    And Municipal Constitutional Council: provides oversight even in emergency
    And we preserve: democratic accountability under pressure
    And protocol enhances: crisis response without sacrificing governance
