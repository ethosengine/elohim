Scenario: Balancing speed and deliberation quality under time pressure
    Given regional crisis creates many urgent appeals
    And we must review decisions quickly
    When we convene emergency sessions for crisis appeals
    Then we maintain: deliberation quality despite urgency
    And we evaluate: if emergency protocols were properly invoked
    And we examine: if crisis justified departures from normal process
    And we provide: expedited review within 48-72 hours
    And we avoid: rubber-stamping under pressure
    And we create: precedent for crisis governance
    And we ensure: democratic accountability even in emergencies
