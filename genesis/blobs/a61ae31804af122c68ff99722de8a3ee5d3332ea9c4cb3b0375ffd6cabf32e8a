Scenario: Expressing feelings and emotions accessibly
    Given Jordan wants to communicate how they're feeling
    And verbal expression might be challenging sometimes
    When Jordan uses the feelings check-in feature
    Then the interface shows emotion faces (happy, sad, angry, scared, etc.)
    And Jordan can select the face that matches their feeling
    And the system asks simple follow-up questions with visual aids
    And Jordan's feelings are communicated to their support network
    And Jordan's emotional expression is honored and validated
    And support is offered if Jordan is struggling
