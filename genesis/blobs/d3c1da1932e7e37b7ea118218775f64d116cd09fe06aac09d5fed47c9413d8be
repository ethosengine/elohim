Scenario: Elder reaches out during health concern
    Given Rose is feeling unwell and wants family support
    When she creates a contribution mentioning she's not feeling well
    And the guardian agent detects health concern indicators
    Then her children are notified appropriately
    And family members can coordinate support and check-ins
    And if needed, healthcare resources are surfaced
    And Rose experiences family care without having to explicitly ask for help
    And the system respects her privacy while enabling family support
