Scenario: Building identity around care contribution and capability
    Given Jasmine has made substantial care contributions over months
    And she balances multiple demanding contexts successfully
    When she reflects on her Value Scanner usage and care economy participation
    Then she should experience herself as a capable, contributing adult
    And her identity should be forming around care for others and community
    And she should understand that her work has genuine economic value
    And she should expect to be taken seriously in economic conversations
    And she should internalize that care economy principles are normal
    And her self-concept should reflect her actual capability and contribution
