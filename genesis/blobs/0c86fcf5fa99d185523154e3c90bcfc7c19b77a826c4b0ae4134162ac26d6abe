Scenario: Workers build relationship with community through transparent sourcing
    Given workers source produce from Johnson Farm
    And community values local food systems and sustainability
    When workers communicate sourcing practices publicly
    Then customers learn their food comes from regenerative local farm
    And community_elohim creates farm-to-table transparency dashboard
    And customers appreciate supporting local farmer and farm workers
    And workers invite community to visit Johnson Farm during harvest
    And community connection deepens through transparent supply chains
