Scenario: Recognition of care economy contributions builds continued purpose
    Given Frank's contributions are substantial but unpaid
    And traditional economics labels him as "not working"
    And he's navigating the cultural narrative of retirement as obsolescence
    When Frank reviews his care contribution data
    Then he should see quantified value of his volunteer and care labor
    And he should understand his economic contribution is significant (~$20k/year)
    And he should experience himself as productive member of society
    And the narrative of retirement as withdrawal should be countered
    And Frank should have data to assert his continued value
    And his dignity, purpose, and self-worth should be affirmed
    And retirement should feel like transition to different contribution, not exit
