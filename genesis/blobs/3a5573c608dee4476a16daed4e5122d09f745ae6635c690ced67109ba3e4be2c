Scenario: Teacher builds parent-teacher coalition for education quality
    Given parents and teachers share commitment to student learning
    But often lack coordination around education policy
    When the Observer facilitates parent-teacher alignment
    Then teachers share professional insights on education policy impacts
    And parents provide family perspective on student experiences
    And shared analysis reveals common interests (smaller classes, arts, counselors)
    And parent-teacher coalition advocates together to decision-makers
    And cross-stakeholder solidarity transforms education advocacy power
