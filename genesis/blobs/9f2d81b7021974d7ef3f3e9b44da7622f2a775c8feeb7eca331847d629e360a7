Scenario: Voice interface enables hands-free shopping list creation
    Given Alex is planning their weekly groceries
    And Alex has difficulty with fine motor tasks
    When Alex wants to create a shopping list
    Then Alex should be able to use voice commands exclusively
    And the system should accurately recognize Alex's speech patterns
    And Alex should be able to add, remove, and modify items by voice
    And the interface should provide clear audio feedback
    And Alex should not be forced to use touch or keyboard if they choose voice
    And the experience should be as efficient as visual interface
    And Alex should have equal access to all shopping features
