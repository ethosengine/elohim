Scenario: Politician evaluates renewable energy policy with comprehensive analysis
    Given competing proposals for renewable energy development
    And conflicting claims about costs and benefits
    When the Observer analyzes renewable energy options and impacts
    Then they see cost trajectories of different energy sources
    And understand job creation in renewable versus fossil fuel sectors
    And identify environmental and health benefits of clean energy
    And review successful renewable policies in other jurisdictions
    And make informed energy policy decisions beyond ideology
