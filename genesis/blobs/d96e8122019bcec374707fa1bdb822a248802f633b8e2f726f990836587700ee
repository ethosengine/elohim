Scenario: Professional teaching work recognized as care labor
    Given Sarah works full-time as a teacher
    And education is one of society's most important care functions
    When Sarah's professional work is tracked in care economy
    Then teaching should be recognized as care labor
    And the educational_elohim should quantify Sarah's care contributions to students
    And professional education should be valued alongside household care
    And Sarah should see her career as care work, not separate from care economy
    And teaching should be explicitly valued as caring for next generation
