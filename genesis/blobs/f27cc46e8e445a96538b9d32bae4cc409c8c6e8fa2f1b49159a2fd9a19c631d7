Scenario: Safe practice environment with age-appropriate mistakes
    Given Emma makes a choice that doesn't align with family needs
    And she selected a more expensive option without considering budget
    When the family experiences the consequence
    Then her personal_agent should guide gentle reflection
    And the agent should ask "How did that work out?"
    And Emma should learn from the mistake without shame
    And consequences should be educational, not punitive
    And she should build judgment through safe practice
    And mistakes should be treated as learning opportunities
    And the stakes should be appropriately low for her age
