Scenario: Appeal of community surveillance or monitoring practices
    Given I believe Community Elohim monitors community members too intrusively
    And I am concerned about surveillance overreach
    When I appeal the monitoring practices
    Then Constitutional Council evaluates if surveillance exceeds constitutional minimums
    And They examine if monitoring serves legitimate care purposes
    And They consider if less invasive methods could achieve same goals
    And They assess if community members have visibility into what's monitored
    And They evaluate if appeal and recourse mechanisms are working properly
    And The appeal protects community from surveillance creep
    And Privacy boundaries are actively defended not passively eroded
