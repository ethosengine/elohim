Scenario: Documenting personal needs for advocacy
    Given I experience specific challenges due to work conditions
    When I want to advocate for changes
    Then the protocol should help me document my needs
    And provide evidence of how current conditions affect my well-being
    And support me in articulating what I need to thrive
    And empower me to advocate for care-economy-aligned workplace policies
