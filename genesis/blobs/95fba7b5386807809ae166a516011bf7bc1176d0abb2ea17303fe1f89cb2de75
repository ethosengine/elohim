Scenario: Analyzing technical expert influence on council decisions
    Given councils rely on experts like Dr. Okonkwo for technical understanding
    And I question whether experts dominate rather than inform
    When I analyze correlation between expert testimony and council decisions
    Then I examine: how often councils follow expert recommendations
    And I identify: cases where councils override expert advice
    And I assess: whether expert testimony quality predicts council confidence
    And I explore: whether some experts influence more than others
    And I investigate: warning signs of expert capture vs healthy advice
    And My research reveals: whether technical-democratic balance is working
    And Findings inform: expert testimony guidelines and council training
