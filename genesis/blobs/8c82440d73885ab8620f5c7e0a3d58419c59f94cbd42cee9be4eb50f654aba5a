Scenario: Former owner's community standing shifts from business owner to honored elder
    Given Rosa was known as "business owner" for 15 years
    And her community identity was tied to entrepreneurial success
    When ownership transitions to workers
    Then Rosa's community standing becomes "founder of democratic institution"
    And neighbors honor her choice to prioritize community over maximum profit
    And her wisdom is sought as elder who facilitated transformation
    And community respects her continued participation as resident, not owner
    And community_elohim documents her transition as model for other small business owners
