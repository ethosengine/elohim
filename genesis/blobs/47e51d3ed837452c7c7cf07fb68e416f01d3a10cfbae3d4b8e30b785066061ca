# Processes and Recipes: How Value Gets Created

## What is a Process?

In hREA, a Process is an activity that transforms resources:
- Takes **inputs** (consumed, used, or cited resources)
- Produces **outputs** (new or modified resources)
- Involves **agents** who do the work

```
Process: Community Health Checkup
├── inputs:
│   ├── consume: medical supplies
│   ├── use: examination equipment
│   └── work: nurse labor (2 hours)
├── outputs:
│   ├── produce: health assessment report
│   └── produce: patient care notes
└── involvedAgents: [nurse_adaeze, patient]
```

## Recipes: Reusable Process Templates

A Recipe (via ProcessSpecification and RecipeFlow) defines **how** to do something:

```
Recipe: Emergency Stabilization Protocol
├── inputs required:
│   ├── IV supplies
│   ├── Monitoring equipment
│   └── Trained nurse (skill: emergency-triage)
├── outputs expected:
│   ├── Stabilized patient
│   └── Care documentation
└── estimatedDuration: 30-60 minutes
```

Recipes enable:
- **Knowledge sharing**: Documented best practices
- **Training**: New agents learn from recipes
- **Coordination**: Teams know what to expect
- **Quality**: Consistent processes

## Processes in Care Networks

Care work follows patterns:

| Process Type | Inputs | Outputs |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Patient Care | Time, supplies, skill | Health, comfort, documentation |
| Device Repair | Parts, labor, expertise | Working device, knowledge |
| Teaching | Time, knowledge, attention | Learning, questions, insights |
| Meal Prep | Ingredients, labor, love | Food, nutrition, togetherness |

## Chaining Processes

Processes connect:
- `previousProcesses`: What came before
- `nextProcesses`: What comes after

This creates **value chains** visible across the network:
```
Farm → Market → Kitchen → Family Meal → Compost → Farm
```

The circular economy becomes traceable.
