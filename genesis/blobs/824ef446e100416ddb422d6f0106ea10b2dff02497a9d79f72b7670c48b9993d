Scenario: Continuing education about rights and entitlements
    Given Jordan has rights as a person with disabilities
    And knowing rights supports self-advocacy
    When Jordan participates in rights education
    Then Jordan learns about ADA, employment rights, housing rights
    And information is provided in highly accessible format
    And Jordan understands what protections they have
    And Jordan can advocate for their rights when violations occur
    And rights education empowers Jordan's full citizenship
    And Jordan experiences being a person with protected rights and dignity
