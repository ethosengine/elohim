Scenario: Municipal healthcare coordination supports aging residents
    Given Frank and his wife both have aging-related healthcare needs
    And navigating healthcare is increasingly complex
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates healthcare access
    Then it should help Frank navigate Medicare and healthcare systems
    And coordinate with municipal health services
    And support access to preventive and chronic care
    And connect healthcare to care economy support systems
    And Frank should maintain health through accessible municipal infrastructure
    And municipal health policy should serve aging residents effectively
