Scenario: Care economy practices integrated with ecological sustainability
    Given care work requires resources: food, transportation, housing, energy
    And care practices can be more or less ecologically sustainable
    And sustainable care economy serves both human and ecological flourishing
    When bioregional_elohim integrates care and ecology
    Then it should help Robert align care practices with ecological sustainability
    And surface opportunities: "Local food sourcing reduces transportation impact while supporting regional care economy"
    And recognize that care for people and care for planet are interconnected
    And support practices that serve both human and ecological wellbeing
    And demonstrate that care economy must be ecologically sustainable
    And build integrated understanding of care and ecology
    And model for next generation that care includes ecological stewardship
