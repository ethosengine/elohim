Scenario: Contributing to global explainability research agenda
    Given delegates need better explainability for oversight
    And current technical capabilities are insufficient
    When I help shape global research priorities
    Then I identify: key explainability challenges for governance
    And I propose: research approaches worth global investment
    And I coordinate: international research collaboration
    And I avoid: promising solutions we cannot deliver
    And I enable: informed global investment in governance technology
    And I serve: long-term capability development for democratic AI
    And I demonstrate: how expertise serves collective problem-solving
