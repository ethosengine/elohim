Scenario: Reducing food waste to minimize environmental impact
    Given food waste has significant ecological costs
    And Aisha sometimes buys more than she can use
    When the personal_agent tracks waste patterns
    Then it should identify environmental impact of waste
    And it should suggest waste reduction strategies
    And it should help her buy appropriate quantities
    And waste reduction should be framed as environmental care
    And the system should help her minimize ecological harm
    And practical waste reduction should be taught
