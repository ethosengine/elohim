Scenario: My journey from cryptographer to democratic governance enabler
    Given I began studying cryptographic AI alignment
    And I now serve humanity's constitutional governance
    When I reflect on my role in global democracy
    Then I understand: expertise serves democratic flourishing
    And I accept: that citizens must judge despite my greater knowledge
    And I respect: human wisdom complementing technical knowledge
    And I practice: humility about what I know and don't know
    And I demonstrate: how technical experts serve rather than dominate
    And I participate: in humanity's attempt to govern with superintelligent AI
    And I know: my expertise matters most when it empowers others' judgment
    And I embody: technical excellence serving democratic hope
