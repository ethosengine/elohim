Scenario: Journalist tracks regional displacement and gentrification
    Given housing costs rise across metropolitan region
    And the journalist investigates who benefits and who is harmed
    When the Observer tracks displacement patterns regionally
    Then the journalist sees working-class communities of color losing residents
    And maps evictions, rent increases, and demographic changes
    And identifies corporate landlords buying properties across region
    And documents regional coordination of displacement
    And publishes investigation connecting local experiences to regional pattern
