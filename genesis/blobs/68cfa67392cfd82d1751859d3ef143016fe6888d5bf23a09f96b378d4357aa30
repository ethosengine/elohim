Scenario: Deliberating with structured process ensuring all voices heard
    Given our council has diverse perspectives that could lead to conflict
    And we need to reach judgment together
    When we follow deliberation protocols
    Then all members: share initial reactions and concerns
    And we identify: points of agreement and disagreement
    And we examine: constitutional principles explicitly
    And we research: relevant precedents from previous cases
    And we consult: experts when technical questions arise
    And we avoid: rushed judgment or groupthink
    And we ensure: quieter members are heard not dominated
    And we reach: decision through genuine collective deliberation
