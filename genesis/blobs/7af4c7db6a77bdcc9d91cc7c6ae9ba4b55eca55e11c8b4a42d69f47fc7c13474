Scenario: Creating precedent that will guide future cases
    Given our council rules on Marcus's mental health intervention appeal
    And we affirm the agent's decision as constitutionally aligned
    When we document our reasoning and recommendations
    Then we explain: why privacy was balanced against care in this case
    And we recommend: protocol enhancements for pre-specified preferences
    And we create: precedent that future councils can reference
    And we document: our deliberation process (anonymized)
    And we contribute: to evolving constitutional interpretation
    And our judgment: becomes part of public constitutional record
    And Marcus's case: makes the protocol better for everyone
