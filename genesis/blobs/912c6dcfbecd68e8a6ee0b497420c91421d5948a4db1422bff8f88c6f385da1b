Scenario: Right to genuine autonomy within developmentally appropriate scope
    Given Emma deserves real agency not simulated choice
    And she is capable of meaningful decision-making at age 8
    When Emma uses the Value Scanner
    Then her choices must be genuinely honored
    And she must have actual decision-making power
    And the autonomy must be real within appropriate boundaries
    And she must experience that her agency matters
    And constitutional protections apply to her dignity
    And her humanity requires genuine respect for her capability
