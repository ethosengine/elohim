Scenario: Council member surfaces constituent intelligence at scale
    Given the politician represents 50,000 residents
    And only 20 constituents typically attend council meetings
    When the Observer aggregates constituent patterns from civic engagement
    Then the politician sees 230 families losing 90 minutes daily to bus delays
    And identifies senior centers underutilized due to access barriers
    And learns small businesses struggle with permit complexity
    And hears from working parents and shift workers who can't attend meetings
    And understands actual constituent needs beyond loudest voices
