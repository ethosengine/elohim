Scenario: Teen develops sophisticated understanding of consumption impacts
    Given Jasmine makes daily purchasing decisions
    And each choice has ecological consequences
    When she uses the Value Scanner to evaluate options
    Then her personal_agent should surface ecological information
    And explain water usage, carbon footprint, and ecosystem impacts
    And connect choices to bioregional effects: "This produce is local and seasonal"
    And help her understand that consumption is participation in ecological systems
    And build sophisticated ecological literacy through daily practice
    And develop her capability to make environmentally informed decisions
