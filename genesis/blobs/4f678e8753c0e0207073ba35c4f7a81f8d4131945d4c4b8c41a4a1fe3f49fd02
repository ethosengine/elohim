Scenario: Franchise locations become community gathering spaces beyond commercial function
    Given corporate franchise design optimized for transaction speed, not community connection
    And neighborhoods lacked accessible gathering spaces for organizing
    When democratic governance considers community space usage
    Then locations offer meeting space for neighborhood organizing after business hours
    And community bulletin boards share local information and mutual aid opportunities
    And youth employment programs connect young people to food service work with dignity
    And spaces become community hubs serving social needs beyond food service
    And community_elohim facilitates community programming in democratic business spaces
