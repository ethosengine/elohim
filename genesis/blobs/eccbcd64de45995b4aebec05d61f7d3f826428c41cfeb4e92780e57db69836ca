Scenario: Accessible communication ensures Alex can participate in neighborhood decisions
    Given neighborhood uses various communication methods
    And some methods may exclude Alex
    When neighborhood decisions are made
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should ensure accessible communication
    And neighborhood should use multiple formats (digital, physical, verbal)
    And Alex should have equal access to all neighborhood information
    And voting and input processes should be accessible
    And Alex's voice should be included in neighborhood governance
    And accessibility should be default, not accommodation
    And the protocol should ensure Alex's full participation
