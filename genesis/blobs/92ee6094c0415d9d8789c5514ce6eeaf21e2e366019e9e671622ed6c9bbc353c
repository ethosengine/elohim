Scenario: Family privacy controls for independent adult
    Given Aisha has adult autonomy
    And she maintains some privacy from family
    When Aisha configures family data sharing
    Then she should control what family sees
    And she should choose what care contributions to share
    And her financial details should remain private unless she shares
    And personal life decisions should be hers to disclose
    And the system should support healthy adult family boundaries
    And privacy should coexist with care economy participation
