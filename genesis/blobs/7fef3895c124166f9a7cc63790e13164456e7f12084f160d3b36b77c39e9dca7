Scenario: Teaching that care work is valuable begins at age 5
    Given traditional economics makes care work invisible
    And Tommy is forming foundational understanding of value
    When Tommy performs care labor in the scanner
    Then the system should explicitly teach that care creates value
    And Tommy should learn "You helped. Your care matters."
    And his care contributions should be recognized immediately
    And he should understand that caring for others is valuable work
    And foundational belief that care has worth should be established
    And this teaching should precede any exposure to market economics
