Scenario: Pre-specifying preferences after successful appeal
    Given my appeal was resolved and I gained the right to set preferences
    When I access my preference settings through the interface
    Then I can specify alert preferences for future interventions
    And I can set thresholds like "family alert only after three-day pattern"
    And I can balance my privacy needs with care considerations
    And The agent respects my preferences in future decisions
    And I feel ownership over my own protection rather than being controlled
