Scenario: Documenting accessibility barriers for collective action
    Given the neighborhood has many accessibility barriers
    And individual complaints often go unaddressed
    When Alex uses the system to document barriers
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should collect systematic barrier data
    And it should identify patterns across multiple residents' reports
    And documentation should support collective advocacy
    And data should enable organized demands for improvements
    And Alex's expertise should strengthen neighborhood organizing
    And the protocol should facilitate collective power-building
    And systematic change should become possible through organized documentation
