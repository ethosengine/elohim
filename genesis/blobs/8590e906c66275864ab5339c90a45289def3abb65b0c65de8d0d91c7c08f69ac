Scenario: Developer track record on environmental commitments
    Given a developer promised tree preservation in previous projects
    And claimed environmental mitigation would offset impacts
    When the Observer tracks environmental commitment delivery
    Then analysis shows: 67% of preserved trees died within two years
    And mitigation site was not maintained as required
    And environmental monitoring was incomplete and inadequate
    And pattern shows promises made to gain approval not kept in practice
    And accountability creates pressure for genuine environmental stewardship
