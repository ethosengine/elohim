Scenario: Educational pace adapts to individual developmental readiness
    Given Tommy's development may differ from age averages
    And learning readiness varies widely at ages 5-7
    When the personal_agent teaches value concepts
    Then instruction should adapt to Tommy's actual capabilities
    And the system should observe Tommy's comprehension
    And pacing should match Tommy's readiness, not chronological age
    And no child should be pushed beyond developmental capacity
    And no child should be held back from what they're ready to learn
