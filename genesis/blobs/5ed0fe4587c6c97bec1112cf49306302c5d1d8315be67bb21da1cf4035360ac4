# Economic Visibility: The Care Economy's Foundation

## The Problem: Invisible Value

Traditional economies make much labor invisible:

| Type of Work | Traditional Value | Actual Value |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Nursing care | Hourly wage | Lives saved, comfort given, learning shared |
| Parenting | $0 | Human development, social stability |
| Eldercare | Minimal | Dignity preserved, wisdom transmitted |
| Mentoring | Often unpaid | Careers launched, skills developed |
| Community organizing | Volunteer | Social cohesion, collective action |

The gap between recognition and contribution is **extraction**.

## The Okonkwo Family's Value Gap

From the Economic Coordination epic:

```
Traditional Economy (What you receive):
└── Adaeze (Nursing): ₦180,000/month

Elohim Network (What you create):
└── Adaeze (Care + Training): ₦2,300,000/month

Value Gap: ₦2,120,000/month extracted
```

## REA Makes Value Visible

With REA accounting, every contribution is recorded:

```json
{
  "event": "Emergency_Stabilization",
  "resources_created": {
    "patient_stability": "critical → stable",
    "family_peace": "anxiety → hope",
    "junior_nurse_learning": "witnessed and documented",
    "hospital_cost_avoided": "ICU transfer prevented"
  },
  "value_flows": {
    "care_tokens_to_adaeze": 23,
    "skill_attestation": "emergency_stabilization_witnessed",
    "monetary_equivalent": "₦78,000"
  }
}
```

## From Visibility to Recognition

The path:
1. **Document**: Record economic events as they happen
2. **Witness**: Others observe and validate contributions
3. **Aggregate**: Value accumulates over time
4. **Recognize**: Tokens, attestations, reputation flow to contributors
5. **Circulate**: Recognition becomes economic power

## The Network That Sees You

> "The old economy is blind. It sees transactions, not transformation. It counts money, not meaning."

The care economy sees:
- The nurse's 3 AM compassion
- The repair tech's environmental stewardship
- The student's peer tutoring
- The parent's invisible labor
- The elder's accumulated wisdom

**And having seen, it recognizes.**
