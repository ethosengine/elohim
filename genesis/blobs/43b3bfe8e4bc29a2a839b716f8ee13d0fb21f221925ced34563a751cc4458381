Scenario: Politician understands education outcome patterns across demographics
    Given the politician governs education policy at state or district level
    And achievement gaps persist across racial and economic lines
    When the Observer analyzes outcome patterns systemically
    Then they see which student populations are underserved
    And identify specific schools with equitable outcomes despite demographics
    And learn what successful schools do differently
    And understand resource and practice patterns that drive equity
    And champion evidence-based policies for all students
