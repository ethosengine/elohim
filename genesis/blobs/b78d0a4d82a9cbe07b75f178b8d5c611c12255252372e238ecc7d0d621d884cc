Scenario: Experiencing the weight of judgment affecting real lives
    Given my decision will affect Marcus's mental health support
    And I cannot hide behind procedure or defer to experts
    When I must judge knowing uncertainty and consequences
    Then I feel: the burden of democratic responsibility
    And I grapple: with possibility I might be wrong
    And I draw on: my experience as nurse who has seen suffering
    And I consider: my role as mother navigating care and autonomy
    And I accept: that I must judge despite uncertainty
    And I am supported: through compensation, training, and respect
    And I learn: what democratic participation means at deepest level
