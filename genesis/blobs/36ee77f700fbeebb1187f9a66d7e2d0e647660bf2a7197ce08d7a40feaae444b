Scenario: Municipal budget allocation informed by protocol data
    Given city council determines annual budget
    And we need evidence about neighborhood needs and priorities
    When Municipal Elohim provides resource flow analysis
    Then we see: which neighborhoods are underserved
    And we identify: where investments would have most impact
    And we understand: how different spending choices ripple across city
    And city council: deliberates and decides using this information
    And we maintain: political accountability for budget choices
    And protocol transparency: enables better democratic decision-making
    And agent information: serves elected governance
