Scenario: City celebrates democratic conversions as municipal economic development success
    Given economic development announcements typically celebrate corporate recruitment
    And democratic conversions deserve equal municipal recognition
    When Rosa's conversion and others reach significant milestones
    Then mayor and city council publicly celebrate worker ownership transitions
    And municipal communications highlight democratic economy as development strategy
    And public celebration builds community awareness and political support
    And recognition encourages other small business owners to consider conversion
    And municipality_elohim coordinates celebration events amplifying democratic economy visibility
