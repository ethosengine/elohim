Scenario: Business legacy transforms from individual ownership to community institution
    Given Rosa built more than business—she created community institution
    And neighbors trust her shop because they trust her personally
    When conversion to democratic ownership formalizes community commitment
    Then Rosa's 15 years of community stewardship is honored and documented
    And sponsorships (youth soccer, school fundraisers) continue under democratic governance
    And informal credit for struggling families becomes formalized support program
    And community institution is preserved beyond Rosa's personal involvement
    And legacy becomes "founder who chose community over individual wealth"
