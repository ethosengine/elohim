Feature: Education Justice Organizing for Community Organizer
  As a community organizer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the educational functional layer
  I want to organize communities for equitable education access and quality
  So that all students receive resources and opportunities regardless of neighborhood or background

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the community_organizer user is registered in the system
    And the educational governance context is active

  Scenario: Organizer documents opportunity gap for education equity campaign
    Given gifted programs concentrate in predominantly white schools
    And advanced placement courses lack availability in low-income schools
    When the Observer provides education equity data
    Then the organizer sees enrichment program distribution across district
    And maps demographic patterns showing systematic disparities
    And calculates opportunity gaps affecting thousands of students
    And identifies organizing base of affected families
    And educational inequality becomes documented basis for organizing

  Scenario: Organizer creates accessible materials on school funding formula
    Given parents don't understand why their school has fewer resources
    And school funding formula is complex and opaque
    When the organizer requests education materials from Observer
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of funding sources
    And see visual comparison of per-pupil spending across schools
    And get breakdown of how formula creates inequities
    And access talking points for advocating for funding changes
    And technical education finance becomes accessible community knowledge

  Scenario: Organizer builds coalition for culturally responsive curriculum
    Given families want curriculum reflecting their communities' histories
    And multiple cultural groups share this interest
    When the organizer uses Observer to facilitate coalition building
    Then they identify parents from different backgrounds with aligned goals
    And coordinate around shared demands for curriculum inclusion
    And help families develop specific proposals with supporting evidence
    And organize testimony showcasing diverse community voices
    And coalition transforms individual requests into collective power

  Scenario: Organizer mobilizes parents against school closure targeting low-income neighborhoods
    Given district proposes closing three schools in working-class areas
    And claims it's necessary for "efficiency"
    When the organizer uses Observer to analyze closure impacts
    Then they show closures increase commute times for low-income families
    And demonstrate stable enrollment contradicting district claims
    And calculate cost of closure to affected communities
    And organize parents to demand community-based solutions
    And education organizing prevents harm to vulnerable students

  Scenario: Organizer tracks implementation of restorative justice commitment
    Given district adopted restorative justice to reduce suspensions
    And the organizer's coalition of parents and students won the policy
    When the Observer tracks implementation progress
    Then the organizer monitors training of school staff
    And sees suspension data by school, race, and disability status
    And identifies schools not implementing restorative practices
    And documents where implementation succeeds and changes outcomes
    And policy victory leads to implementation accountability
