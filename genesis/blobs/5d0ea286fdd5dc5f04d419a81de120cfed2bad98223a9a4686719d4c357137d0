Scenario: Bulk buying and package reduction practices
    Given Margaret learned to buy bulk to reduce packaging
    And package reduction serves both budget and ecology
    When Margaret shops with minimal packaging
    Then the bioregional_elohim should track packaging reduction
    And bulk buying should be recognized as ecological practice
    And Margaret's practices should inform community purchasing
    And package waste should be minimized
    And bioregional resource flows should be optimized
    And frugality should align with ecological goals
