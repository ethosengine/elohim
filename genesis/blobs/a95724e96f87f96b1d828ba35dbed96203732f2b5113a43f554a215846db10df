Scenario: Neighborhood boundaries prevent over-commitment
    Given Robert has limited capacity amid other demands
    And neighborhood participation could expand indefinitely
    And sustainable participation requires boundaries
    When neighborhood_elohim monitors Robert's neighborhood engagement
    Then it should recognize when neighborhood demands exceed his capacity
    And help him set healthy boundaries on neighborhood participation
    And surface when he's taking on too much neighborhood responsibility
    And support him in saying no to additional commitments
    And ensure neighborhood participation enhances rather than depletes him
    And protect him from burnout through over-commitment
    And help him maintain sustainable neighborhood engagement
