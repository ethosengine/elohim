Scenario: Care token accumulation reflects totality of invisible labor
    Given Sarah performs mental labor and physical labor continuously
    And traditional economics renders her household work invisible
    When the Value Scanner tracks Sarah's care contributions
    Then care tokens should accumulate for meal planning, not just cooking
    And tokens should reflect coordinating schedules, managing inventory, teaching values
    And emotional labor should be valued alongside physical tasks
    And the full complexity of parenting work should be quantified
    And Sarah's care token balance should reflect her enormous contributions
    And invisible care labor should become economically visible
