Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained with full accessibility
    Given Alex has been using the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply to all users equally
    When Alex chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then disconnection process must be fully accessible
    And Alex should receive complete data export in accessible formats
    And no manipulative retention patterns should be employed
    And Alex's right to not participate must be absolute
    And data portability should work with assistive technologies
    And exit should be as accessible as entry
    And Alex's autonomy includes the right to leave
