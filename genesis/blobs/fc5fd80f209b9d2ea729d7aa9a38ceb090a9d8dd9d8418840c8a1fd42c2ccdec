Scenario: Manager accesses fair compensation without guilt of extraction
    Given Marcus earned $65K as corporate manager implementing exploitation
    And he knew he was paid partly for willingness to harm workers
    When he becomes democratic coordinator earning $72K
    Then his compensation reflects genuine coordination expertise
    And workers democratically approved his salary as fair
    And he earns more than under corporate while feeling morally justified
    And he no longer carries guilt of being paid to extract from colleagues
    And workplace_elohim ensures compensation transparency prevents exploitation
