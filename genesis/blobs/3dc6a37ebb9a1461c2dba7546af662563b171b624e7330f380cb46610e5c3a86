Scenario: Coordinating multiple contexts of care contribution
    Given Frank contributes across multiple contexts simultaneously
    And he volunteers with Habitat, provides family care, serves on council
    When his personal_agent tracks contributions across contexts
    Then it should integrate volunteer work, family care, and civic participation
    And it should coordinate scheduling across multiple commitments
    And it should prevent overcommitment and burnout
    And it should surface conflicts and help prioritize
    And Frank should see his full contribution across all contexts
    And multi-context participation should be supported and celebrated
    And the system should help him balance diverse contributions effectively
