Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent
  As a single parent operating under severe resource constraints
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want to recognize that my necessary thrift aligns with environmental sustainability
  So that my resource efficiency is valued as ecological stewardship, not just poverty

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the single parent user "Maria" is registered in the system
    And Maria operates household of four on $42k/year with severe resource constraints
    And her necessary economic efficiency creates low environmental impact
    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active
    And the bioregional_elohim tracks environmental impact and resource use
    And Maria's consumption patterns are shaped by economic necessity

  Scenario: Resource constraints create low consumption footprint
    Given Maria cannot afford unnecessary purchases or waste
    And she maximizes every dollar and minimizes consumption
    When her household's environmental impact is assessed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her low consumption footprint
    And it should frame her thrift as environmental virtue, not just poverty
    And her resource efficiency should be celebrated as ecological stewardship
    And economic constraint should be reframed as environmental contribution
    And Maria should see her household as environmentally exemplary

  Scenario: Food waste prevention driven by economic necessity
    Given Maria cannot afford to waste food on $175/week grocery budget
    And she carefully plans meals, uses leftovers, and minimizes spoilage
    When household food waste is tracked
    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify her minimal food waste
    And it should recognize that she achieves what environmental advocates aim for
    And her food waste prevention should be valued as ecological contribution
    And economic necessity should be honored as environmental effectiveness
    And Maria should be recognized as food sustainability leader

  Scenario: Strategic shopping reduces transportation emissions
    Given Maria carefully plans shopping trips to maximize efficiency
    And she coordinates purchases to minimize separate trips
    When transportation patterns are analyzed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her efficient transportation
    And it should value her trip consolidation as emissions reduction
    And her careful planning should be seen as environmental stewardship
    And economic efficiency should be recognized as climate contribution
    And Maria should see her behavior as environmentally valuable

  Scenario: Bulk buying and preservation for household economy and sustainability
    Given Maria buys in bulk when possible to reduce costs
    And she preserves food to extend usability and reduce waste
    When household food practices are assessed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize bulk buying and preservation as sustainable
    And it should value her food stewardship practices
    And her economic strategies should be seen as environmental best practices
    And preservation skills should be honored as ecological knowledge
    And Maria should be recognized for traditional sustainability practices

  Scenario: Repair and reuse culture born of necessity
    Given Maria cannot afford to replace items frequently
    And she repairs, maintains, and extends the life of possessions
    When household consumption patterns are tracked
    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify her repair and reuse practices
    And it should celebrate her circular economy participation
    And her repair culture should be valued as waste reduction
    And economic necessity should be reframed as environmental leadership
    And Maria should see herself as exemplifying sustainable consumption

  Scenario: Secondhand and sharing economy participation
    Given Maria purchases secondhand when possible to reduce costs
    And she participates in sharing networks to avoid unnecessary purchases
    When household acquisition patterns are analyzed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her secondhand economy participation
    And it should value sharing networks as resource efficiency
    And her practices should be celebrated as circular economy leadership
    And economic constraint should be honored as environmental wisdom
    And Maria should be recognized as sustainability practitioner

  Scenario: Energy efficiency motivated by utility bill constraints
    Given Maria carefully manages utility costs on tight budget
    And she minimizes energy use to keep bills affordable
    When household energy consumption is tracked
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her low energy footprint
    And it should celebrate her energy efficiency as climate contribution
    And her utility management should be valued as environmental stewardship
    And economic necessity should be reframed as climate leadership
    And Maria should see her household as energy efficiency exemplar

  Scenario: Local food systems participation through necessity and community
    Given Maria seeks affordable food through farmers markets, co-ops, and bulk buying
    And she participates in local food economy when economically viable
    When food sourcing patterns are analyzed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her local food participation
    And it should value community-based food systems engagement
    And her food choices should be seen as supporting regional resilience
    And economic cooperation should be honored as bioregional participation
    And Maria should see her food practices as locally sustaining

  Scenario: Teaching children environmental values through lived practice
    Given Maria's children witness thrift, waste prevention, and resource care daily
    And they learn sustainability through household necessity
    When children's environmental education is assessed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize that Maria teaches sustainability through practice
    And it should value lived environmental education over abstract lessons
    And her children should be developing deep sustainability values
    And household practices should be honored as effective environmental socialization
    And Maria should be recognized as teaching next generation environmental stewardship

  Scenario: Community resource sharing networks reduce regional consumption
    Given Maria participates in tool libraries, clothing swaps, and resource sharing
    And these networks reduce overall community consumption
    When bioregional resource flows are tracked
    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify community sharing impact
    And it should recognize Maria's participation in community resource efficiency
    And sharing networks should be valued as bioregional resilience building
    And community cooperation should be celebrated as ecological practice
    And Maria should see her participation as regional sustainability contribution

  Scenario: Low consumption as climate justice leadership
    Given wealthy overconsumption drives climate crisis
    And Maria's low-income household has minimal climate impact
    When climate justice is assessed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize that Maria is not causing climate crisis
    And it should acknowledge that low-income households bear crisis costs without causing it
    And her low consumption should be honored, not stigmatized
    And climate justice should recognize economic inequality in emissions
    And Maria should be seen as climate leader, not climate burden

  Scenario: Regional food security through care economy participation
    Given Maria participates in food cooperatives and bulk buying networks
    And these networks build local food security and resilience
