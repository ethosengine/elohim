Scenario: Managing personal care routine with autonomy
    Given Jordan has a morning self-care routine
    And Jordan can complete most tasks independently with reminders
    When Jordan uses the morning routine feature
    Then the interface shows each task as a picture checklist
    And Jordan can mark tasks complete as they finish them
    And the system provides gentle audio reminders if Jordan forgets
    And the personal_agent celebrates Jordan's independence
    And support workers only assist when Jordan requests help
    And Jordan's autonomy is maximized within their capabilities
