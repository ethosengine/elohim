Scenario: Learning economic systems through lived experience
    Given Marcus navigates real economic constraints daily
    And he experiences market systems, pricing, scarcity directly
    When Marcus develops economic understanding
    Then he should learn economics through authentic participation
    And he should understand supply and demand through shopping
    And he should grasp market failures through food desert experience
    And economic theory should be grounded in lived reality
    And his understanding should be deeper than abstract classroom learning
    And care economy should provide superior economic education
