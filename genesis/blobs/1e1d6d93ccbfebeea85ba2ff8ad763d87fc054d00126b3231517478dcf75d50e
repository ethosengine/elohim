Scenario: Pre-specify alert preferences after appeal experience
    Given Marcus's appeal has been reviewed by Constitutional Council
    And the council affirmed the agent's decision but recommended enhancements
    When Marcus wants to prevent future unilateral interventions
    Then the system allows Marcus to pre-specify his alert preferences
    And Marcus configures family alerts to require 3-day pattern instead of immediate
    And Marcus confirms emergency services contact only for imminent danger
    And the preferences are cryptographically stored and verifiable
    And future Family Elohim decisions must respect these preferences
    And Marcus retains ability to update preferences at any time
