Scenario: Municipal emergency preparedness utilizes retired residents' availability
    Given Frank has daytime availability and construction skills
    And municipalities need emergency response capacity
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates emergency preparedness
    Then it should include retired residents in emergency planning
    And utilize their skills and availability for emergency response
    And coordinate community-level resilience with municipal systems
    And recognize retired residents as municipal emergency resource
    And Frank should contribute meaningfully to collective safety
    And municipal preparedness should leverage care economy networks
