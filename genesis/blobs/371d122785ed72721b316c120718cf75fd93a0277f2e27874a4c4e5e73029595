Scenario: Elder care planning anticipates increasing needs
    Given Robert's parents are ages 78 and 75
    And their care needs will likely increase
    And family should plan proactively rather than react to crises
    When family_elohim supports elder care planning
    Then it should help family anticipate future care needs
    And surface: "Medical patterns suggest increased care needs likely within 2-3 years"
    And support family in discussing long-term care options
    And help siblings plan for potential crisis scenarios
    And ensure parents are included in planning with dignity
    And coordinate financial, medical, and housing planning
    And prevent family crisis from lack of preparation
