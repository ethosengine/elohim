Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult
  As a young adult making independent consumption decisions
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want to understand environmental impacts and make sustainable choices
  So that I balance ecological responsibility with budget constraints

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the young_adult user "Aisha" is registered in the system
    And Aisha is an independent consumer
    And her choices directly affect ecological systems
    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active
    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates environmental stewardship
    And Aisha wants to be environmentally responsible within her means

  Scenario: Understanding ecological impact of consumption choices
    Given Aisha's food choices affect environmental systems

    When Aisha shops for produce
    Then the bioregional_elohim should highlight local options
    And it should explain seasonal availability
    And it should teach about her bioregion's food production
    And local food choices should be encouraged when affordable
    And she should learn her region's agricultural patterns
    And bioregional food literacy should develop

  Scenario: Reducing food waste to minimize environmental impact
    Given food waste has significant ecological costs
    And Aisha sometimes buys more than she can use
    When the personal_agent tracks waste patterns
    Then it should identify environmental impact of waste
    And it should suggest waste reduction strategies
    And it should help her buy appropriate quantities
    And waste reduction should be framed as environmental care
    And the system should help her minimize ecological harm
    And practical waste reduction should be taught

  Scenario: Understanding transportation impact on food choices
    Given transportation contributes to food's environmental footprint
    And Aisha lives in an urban area
    When the bioregional_elohim analyzes her shopping patterns
    Then it should consider transportation in environmental impact
    And it should suggest efficient shopping routes
    And it should help her minimize transportation emissions
    And the full ecological cost including transport should be visible
    And bioregional analysis should inform sustainable choices

  Scenario: Participating in bioregional food systems
    Given bioregional food systems reduce environmental impact
    And Aisha could access local food networks
    When the bioregional_elohim surfaces opportunities
    Then it should connect her to farmers markets, CSAs, or food hubs
    And it should explain benefits of bioregional food systems
    And it should help her participate within budget constraints
    And local food networks should be accessible and affordable
    And bioregional participation should support environmental sustainability

  Scenario: Learning about ecological carrying capacity and limits
    Given ecosystems have finite carrying capacity
    And consumption must stay within ecological limits
    When the personal_agent teaches environmental concepts
    Then it should explain ecological limits and boundaries
    And it should help her understand planetary boundaries
    And it should frame consumption within ecological context
    And she should learn that infinite growth is impossible
    And ecological literacy should include limits and constraints

  Scenario: Sustainable protein choices within budget
    Given protein production has varied environmental impact
    And Aisha wants to make sustainable choices
    When Aisha selects protein sources
    Then the bioregional_elohim should show environmental impact differences
    And it should highlight lower-impact protein options
    And it should help her access affordable sustainable proteins
    And plant-based options should be presented when cheaper
    And environmental impact should inform protein decisions
    And sustainable nutrition should be achievable on her budget

  Scenario: Understanding water usage in food production
    Given food production uses significant water resources
    And water scarcity is increasing
    When the bioregional_elohim displays environmental data
    Then it should include water usage in impact assessment
    And it should explain water costs of different foods
    And it should help her choose lower water-impact options
    And bioregional water context should inform recommendations
    And she should understand food-water connections

  Scenario: Packaging waste reduction and recycling
    Given packaging creates environmental waste
    And Aisha wants to reduce packaging impact
    When Aisha makes purchasing decisions
    Then the bioregional_elohim should highlight packaging differences
    And it should suggest lower-packaging alternatives
    And it should provide local recycling and composting information
    And waste management should connect to bioregional systems
    And she should learn to minimize packaging waste
    And circular economy principles should be taught

  Scenario: Climate impact of dietary choices
    Given food production contributes to climate change
    And individual choices aggregate to systemic impact
    When Aisha evaluates food options
    Then the bioregional_elohim should show carbon footprint
    And it should explain climate impact of different choices
    And it should help her make lower-impact selections
    And climate literacy should inform dietary decisions
    And she should understand individual contribution to climate crisis
    And climate-conscious choices should be supported
