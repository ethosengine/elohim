Scenario: Municipal board member prepares for complex zoning ordinance revision
    Given planning staff proposes comprehensive zoning code update
    And draft ordinance is 150 pages of technical legal language
    And board must vote within 30 days after public comment period
    When the board member uses Observer decision support
    Then they receive executive summary highlighting key policy changes and impacts
    And see comparison of proposed code to peer municipalities' approaches
    And access analysis of who benefits and who is burdened by major changes
    And get specific questions to ask staff about implementation concerns
    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment on complex ordinance
