Scenario: Politician exposes corporate wage theft patterns requiring enforcement
    Given worker advocates report systematic wage theft
    And enforcement resources are limited
    When the Observer analyzes wage and hour violations
    Then they see violation patterns by industry and employer
    And identify employers with repeated wage theft violations
    And understand which worker populations most affected
    And calculate economic impact of wage theft on working families
    And demand enforcement resources targeting systematic violators
