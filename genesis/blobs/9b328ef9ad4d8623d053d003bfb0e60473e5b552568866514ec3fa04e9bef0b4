Scenario: Food service workers and farmworkers build solidarity across supply chain
    Given workers in restaurants and farms were isolated from each other
    And corporate structure prevented relationship building across supply chain
    When democratic network connects food workers and farmworkers
    Then Emma (restaurant worker) and Tom's farmworkers coordinate directly
    And workers across supply chain recognize shared interests and values
    And solidarity builds between urban food service and rural agriculture
    And cross-training opportunities enable workers to learn full food system
