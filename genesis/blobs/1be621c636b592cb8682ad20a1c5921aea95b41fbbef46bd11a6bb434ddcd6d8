Scenario: Community accountability mechanisms ensure democratic governance serves neighborhood
    Given business operates in and depends on community
    And community has legitimate interest in business practices and impacts
    When community governance structures enable neighborhood voice
    Then community stakeholder meetings provide input on business direction
    And neighbors can raise concerns about environmental impacts or labor practices
    And workers consider community feedback in democratic decision-making
    And accountability is transparent and bidirectional (community and workers both accountable)
    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation while protecting worker autonomy
