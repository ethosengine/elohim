Scenario: Addressing existential AI risk through democratic governance
    Given superintelligent AI poses existential threat
    And democratic oversight might mitigate this risk
    When I participate in global existential risk discussions
    Then I argue: constitutional accountability reduces AI risk
    And I present: evidence that sortition prevents elite capture
    And I promote: transparency enabling global democratic oversight
    And I support: recourse mechanisms providing adaptation
    And I advocate: for protocol's distributed architecture increasing resilience
    And I acknowledge: uncertainties about whether this suffices
    And I work: toward governance frameworks for humanity's survival
