Scenario: Workplace culture shift through middle management advocacy
    Given Robert has influence as mid-level manager
    And workplace culture often penalizes care responsibilities
    And middle managers can model care-friendly leadership
    When workplace_elohim supports culture change
    Then it should help Robert model care economy principles in his management
    And support him in being transparent about his care responsibilities
    And help him advocate for team members' care needs
    And build workplace culture where care is normalized rather than hidden
    And demonstrate that managers can lead cultural transformation
    And create workplace environment where caregiving is supported
    And leverage his position for systemic culture change
