Feature: School District Governance for Elected Representative
  As a politician in the public_observer system
  Operating at the district governance layer
  I want to understand district operations and community needs
  So that I can govern complex education systems serving thousands of children effectively

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the politician user is registered in the system
    And the district governance context is active

  Scenario: School board member understands resource distribution across schools
    Given the politician governs district with 40 schools
    And limited visibility into daily school operations
    When the Observer analyzes district resource patterns
    Then they see experienced teachers concentrated in affluent area schools
    And identify disparities in per-student spending across buildings
    And learn which schools lack arts programs and advanced courses
    And understand facility maintenance varies by neighborhood
    And advocate for equitable resource distribution with evidence

  Scenario: Board member evaluates superintendent budget proposal with impact analysis
    Given administration proposes budget with cuts and reallocations
    And presents optimistic framing of difficult trade-offs
    When the Observer provides impact analysis
    Then they see which students and schools bear burden of cuts
    And understand transportation changes affect working parent schedules
    And identify which programs lose funding versus protected priorities
    And compare budget choices to similar districts
    And ask informed questions challenging rosy assumptions

  Scenario: School board member surfaces parent and teacher concerns at scale
    Given the politician hears from vocal parents at board meetings
    But suspects broader community has different priorities
    When the Observer aggregates parent and teacher input
    Then they see working parents can't attend evening meetings
    And learn teachers face classroom supply shortages systematically
    And identify parent concerns about mental health resources
    And understand transportation reliability affects family schedules
    And align policy with broader community needs beyond meeting attendees

  Scenario: Board member tracks accountability for student outcome commitments
    Given the politician pledged to improve reading proficiency
    And committed to closing achievement gaps
    When the Observer monitors outcome tracking
    Then they see reading proficiency trends by school and demographic
    And identify which interventions work versus ineffective programs
    And receive alerts when metrics decline
    And understand whether district implements promised reforms
    And maintain accountability for student outcome commitments

  Scenario: School board member distinguishes authentic parent concern from coordinated campaign
    Given the politician receives mass emails opposing curriculum
    And messages claim widespread parent outrage
    When the Observer analyzes campaign origins
    Then they see template messages from national advocacy organization
    And identify 15 local parents among 300 emails
    And distinguish coordinated political campaign from genuine community concern
    And understand actual parent sentiment in district
    And resist manipulation by outside political organizations

  Scenario: Board member builds coalition for increased education funding
    Given the politician seeks voter approval for tax levy
    And needs broad community support
    When the Observer identifies coalition potential
    Then they see parents care about class sizes and programs
    And identify business leaders concerned about workforce preparation
    And connect with community organizations serving families
    And facilitate coalition across diverse stakeholder groups
    And build campaign for education investment with broad base

  Scenario: School board member evaluates charter school proposal with evidence
    Given charter organization proposes new school in district
    And presents compelling student achievement promises
    When the Observer analyzes charter track record
    Then they see organization's student outcomes in other cities
    And learn whether achievement gains account for selective enrollment
    And understand fiscal impact on district schools
    And review discipline and expulsion rates for vulnerable students
    And make informed decision on charter authorization

  Scenario: Board member monitors discipline disparities and pushes for equity
    Given the politician committed to equitable school climate
    When the Observer tracks discipline outcomes by demographics
    Then they see Black students suspended at 3x rate of white students
    And learn similar behaviors result in different consequences by race
    And identify which schools have restorative practices versus zero-tolerance
    And compare district patterns to best-practice districts
    And champion policy reform for equitable discipline

  Scenario: School board member understands transportation impact on families
    Given administration proposes transportation cuts for budget savings
    When the Observer analyzes transportation usage and impacts
    Then they see which families depend on bus routes for work schedules
    And identify students who will lose access without transportation
    And understand time burdens on working parents from route changes
    And calculate actual family costs of proposed savings
    And evaluate trade-offs with family wellbeing impact visible

  Scenario: Board member verifies administrator claims about state mandates
    Given district administration claims state mandates prevent local changes
    And politicians suspect bureaucratic resistance masked as legal constraint
    When the Observer researches actual state requirements
    Then they see what's legally required versus administrative preference
    And identify how other districts handle same mandates differently
    And distinguish genuine constraints from bureaucratic inertia
    And push for changes within actual legal bounds
    And hold administration accountable for implementation choices
