Scenario: Community investment demonstrates alternative to corporate subsidy model
    Given municipal economic development typically subsidizes corporate expansion
    And Patricia's taxes funded corporate subsidies with minimal community benefit
    When community investment proves superior economic development strategy
    Then her $10K investment creates more jobs and better wages than equivalent corporate subsidy
    And no public money is required—private capital supports democratic conversions
    And municipal officials observe community investment effectiveness
    And economic development strategy shifts toward supporting democratic ownership
    And municipality_elohim documents community investment outcomes for policy advocacy
