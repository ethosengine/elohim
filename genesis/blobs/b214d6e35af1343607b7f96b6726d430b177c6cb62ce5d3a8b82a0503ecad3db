## 2 Kings 23:10

> The worship of Moloch, involving human sacrifice, particularly the sacrifice of children by fire, is a historical example that can be related to the concept of a multipolar trap in game theory. In the context of 2 Kings 23:10, King Josiah's reforms, including the desecration of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to prevent sacrifices to Moloch, highlight a societal effort to escape from a deeply entrenched and destructive practice.
