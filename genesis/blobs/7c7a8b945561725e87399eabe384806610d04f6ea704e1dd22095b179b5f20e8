Scenario: Neighborhood walking and outdoor activity with grandchildren
    Given Margaret takes grandchildren on neighborhood walks
    And they visit parks, library, neighbors, and local businesses
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks local engagement
    Then it should recognize this as neighborhood participation
    And it should value intergenerational use of neighborhood spaces
    And it should show Margaret teaching grandchildren about their community
    And walking should build neighborhood social connections
    And local business patronage should support neighborhood economy
    And Margaret's activities should strengthen neighborhood vitality
