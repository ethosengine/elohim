Scenario: State legislator builds coalition for statewide healthcare reform
    Given the politician champions Medicaid expansion
    And needs bipartisan support for passage
    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities
    Then they see rural hospitals support expansion for financial survival
    And identify business groups concerned about employee healthcare costs
    And connect with faith organizations serving uninsured populations
    And map which legislators have constituent pressure for expansion
    And build diverse coalition across partisan and geographic divides
