Scenario: Politician builds coalition for worker protection legislation
    Given the politician champions paid sick leave requirement
    And needs support from diverse constituencies
    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities
    Then they see public health advocates support disease prevention
    And identify parent groups concerned about sick children and work
    And connect with faith communities serving working families
    And facilitate coalition across worker rights and community health interests
    And build broad-based support for worker protections
