Scenario: Building sustainable resource management patterns under constraint
    Given Kenji manages extreme resource constraint with $180/week total budget
    And his scarcity requires sophisticated planning and discipline
    When the personal_agent helps Kenji develop resource management practices
    Then it should teach budgeting, meal planning, and strategic shopping
    And it should help him distinguish needs from wants under pressure
    And it should validate that managing scarcity is skilled work
    And the agent should recognize his constraint management as capability development
    And patterns learned now should become sustainable adult habits
    And Kenji should learn that resource stewardship is care economy skill
