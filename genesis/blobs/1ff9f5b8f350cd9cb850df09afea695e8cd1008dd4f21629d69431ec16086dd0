Scenario: Family provides recognition that builds young child's care identity
    Given Tommy has made care contributions over weeks
    And the family_elohim has tracked patterns
    When family recognition moments occur
    Then Sarah should receive prompts for specific acknowledgment
    And recognition should highlight Tommy's care work
    And acknowledgment should feel genuine, not mechanical
    And Tommy should internalize identity as caring family member
    And positive reinforcement should build care-centered self-concept
    And the family should collectively value invisible care labor
