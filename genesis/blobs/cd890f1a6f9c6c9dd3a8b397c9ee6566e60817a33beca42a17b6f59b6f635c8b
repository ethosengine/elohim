Scenario: Interviewing appellant about appeal experience and recourse
    Given Marcus appealed his Family Elohim's mental health intervention
    And he has consented to research interview
    When I ask about his experience of the appeal process
    Then he shares: emotional impact of feeling violated then heard
    And he describes: accessibility of appeal interface, dignity of process
    And he explains: how explanation changed his understanding
    And he reflects: reconciliation with agent through meaningful recourse
    And I learn: what made the process feel legitimate despite initial anger
    And I understand: lived experience that statistics cannot capture
    And His story humanizes governance mechanisms for research audience
