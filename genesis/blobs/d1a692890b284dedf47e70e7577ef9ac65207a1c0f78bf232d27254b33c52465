Scenario: Coordinating educational planning for children's long-term development
    Given crisis is temporary but children's educational trajectory is long-term
    And current educational decisions affect future opportunities
    When I make educational choices considering children's futures
    Then the Value Scanner helps me consider long-term educational implications
    And balances immediate stability needs with future development
    And tracks children's educational progress and trajectory
    And ensures crisis doesn't permanently derail educational opportunities
    And validates that my educational planning serves children's futures
    And my personal_agent surfaces educational opportunities supporting development
    And recognizes long-term educational planning as sophisticated parenting
    And celebrates my investment in children's educational futures despite crisis
