Scenario: Household care tokens reflect both partners' contributions
    Given Robert and Jennifer both contribute substantial household labor
    And they coordinate care for parents and support for children
    When household_elohim calculates care tokens
    Then both partners' contributions should be valued appropriately
    And household labor should be recognized economically
    And care coordination should be valued alongside direct care
    And emotional labor should be made visible and valued
    And both partners should see their care work recognized
    And household care economy should operate on equity principles
    And token allocation should support rather than strain partnership
