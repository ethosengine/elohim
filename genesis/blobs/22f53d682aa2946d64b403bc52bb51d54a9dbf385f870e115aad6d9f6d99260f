Scenario: Accessible grocery shopping with delivery coordination
    Given Alex uses the Value Scanner for meal planning and shopping
    And Alex cannot easily transport heavy grocery items
    When Alex completes weekly shopping
    Then the system should coordinate delivery seamlessly
    And Alex should be able to schedule delivery to match their availability
    And heavy items should be handled by support workers or delivery staff
    And Alex should maintain control over product selection
    And delivery should be dignified, not framed as special accommodation
    And the process should be as efficient as able-bodied shopping
    And Alex should have equal access to all products and options
