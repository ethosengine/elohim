Scenario: Wisdom and experience sharing valued as family contribution
    Given Frank has 70 years of life experience and decades of construction expertise
    And his knowledge is valuable family resource
    When family_elohim tracks knowledge sharing
    Then Frank's guidance to adult children should be recognized
    And teaching grandchildren life and practical skills should be valued
    And sharing construction knowledge should be quantified
    And wisdom transmission should count as care contribution
    And family should experience Frank as source of valuable knowledge
    And his expertise should be actively utilized, not patronized
    And knowledge sharing should be reciprocal across generations
