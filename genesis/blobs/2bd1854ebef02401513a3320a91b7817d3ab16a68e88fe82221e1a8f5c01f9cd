Scenario: Emergency preparedness includes senior needs and capabilities
    Given Margaret has nursing background and crisis response experience
    And seniors have specific vulnerabilities in emergencies
    When the municipality_elohim coordinates emergency planning
    Then Margaret should be part of emergency response networks
    And her skills should be known to emergency management
    And senior vulnerabilities should be planned for
    And senior capabilities should be mobilized in crisis
    And municipal preparedness should include and empower seniors
    And Margaret should contribute to community resilience
