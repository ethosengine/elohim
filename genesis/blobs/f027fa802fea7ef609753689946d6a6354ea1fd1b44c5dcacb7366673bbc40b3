Scenario: Developer affordable housing benefits school stability
    Given a responsible developer builds genuinely affordable housing
    And prioritizes families over luxury apartments
    When the Observer tracks educational community impacts
    Then analysis shows: stable affordable housing reduces student mobility
    And children in affordable housing have better educational outcomes
    And schools benefit from stable enrollment not constant turnover
    And affordable development creates educational community benefit
    And genuine affordability serves families not just developer profit
