Scenario: Budget crisis triggers appropriate intervention
    Given Marcus manages $75 weekly budget
    And unexpected expenses could create crisis
    When budget becomes unsustainable
    Then the family_elohim should alert Sarah immediately
    And it should connect family to emergency resources
    And crisis intervention should preserve Marcus's dignity
    And the system should prevent budget failure from becoming catastrophic
    And support should be framed through care economy, not charity
    And Marcus should not feel responsible for systemic poverty
