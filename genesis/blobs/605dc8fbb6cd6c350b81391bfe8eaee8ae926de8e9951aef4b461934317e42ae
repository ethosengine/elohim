Scenario: Alex's accessibility advocacy improves neighborhood for everyone
    Given Alex documents accessibility barriers in the neighborhood
    And improved accessibility benefits elderly residents, parents with strollers, delivery workers
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks Alex's advocacy contributions
    Then Alex's work identifying barriers should accumulate care tokens
    And advocacy for curb cuts, accessible entrances, better lighting benefits whole neighborhood
    And Alex's contributions should be recognized as care work for community
    And the protocol should make visible how disability advocacy serves everyone
    And Alex should be seen as neighborhood improver, not complainer
    And care economy should value Alex's expertise about accessibility
    And neighborhood should understand Alex's work as gift to all residents
