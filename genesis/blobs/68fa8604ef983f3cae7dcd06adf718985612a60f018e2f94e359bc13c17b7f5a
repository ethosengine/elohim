Scenario: Integrating protocol with existing city governance
    Given city council still passes ordinances and makes policy
    And Elohim Protocol augments rather than replaces government
    When I coordinate protocol with traditional civic structures
    Then Community Elohim: provides information for council decisions
    And city council: maintains authority over policy
    And planning commission: still reviews developments (with agent input)
    And existing institutions: work alongside protocol
    And I clarify: boundaries and responsibilities
    And we avoid: conflicts between agent decisions and local law
    And integration strengthens: both democratic governance and AI support
