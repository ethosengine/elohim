Scenario: Neighborhood children and elders connected across generations
    Given Robert's grandchild occasionally visits
    And neighborhood has elderly residents and young families
    And intergenerational connection benefits everyone
    When neighborhood_elohim facilitates intergenerational connection
    Then it should coordinate intergenerational activities
    And connect Robert's visiting grandchild with neighborhood children
    And facilitate connections between neighborhood elders and families
    And build multigenerational neighborhood care networks
    And reduce isolation for elderly residents
    And provide care and enrichment for children
    And demonstrate that neighborhoods thrive through age diversity
    And strengthen community through intergenerational care
