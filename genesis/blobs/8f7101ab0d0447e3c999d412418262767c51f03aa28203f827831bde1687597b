Scenario: Neighborhood meal support during caregiver crisis periods
    Given caregiving intensity varies with David's condition
    And James may have periods of extreme overwhelm
    When the neighborhood_elohim detects crisis conditions
    Then it should coordinate meal support from neighbors
    And meal delivery should be appropriate for David's dietary needs
    And food support should be dignified, not stigmatizing
    And neighborhood should provide practical crisis support
    And James should access help during overwhelming periods
