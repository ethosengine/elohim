Scenario: Worker organizing and collective advocacy
    Given student workers often face systemic workplace problems
    And collective action can create change
    When Kenji and coworkers organize for better conditions
    Then the workplace_elohim should recognize organizing as care economy work
    And it should support collective advocacy for fair wages and treatment
    And it should accumulate care tokens for organizing labor
    And it should protect his right to organize without retaliation
    And the system should empower student worker collective action
    And Kenji should learn that workers have power through solidarity
