Scenario: Activist identifies affected community members for organizing
    Given a city policy will impact 300 residents in the neighborhood
    And the activist needs to build organized base
    When the Observer detects affected residents
    Then the activist can see community impact patterns
    And identify residents most affected by the issue
    And facilitate grassroots testimony development
    And build coalition grounded in lived experience
    And transform policy analysis into community power
