Scenario: Workplace privacy protects Alex's medical information
    Given employers should not have access to private medical information
    And disability disclosure is often required but should be limited
    When workplace requests disability documentation
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex share minimum necessary information
    And it should protect Alex's medical privacy rigorously
    And detailed medical information should never be shared with managers or coworkers
    And only accommodation needs should be disclosed, not diagnoses
    And Alex's privacy should be protected even while requesting accommodations
    And the protocol should guide appropriate disclosure boundaries
    And medical information should remain confidential
