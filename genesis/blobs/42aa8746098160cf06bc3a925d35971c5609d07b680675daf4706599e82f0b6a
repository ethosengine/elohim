Scenario: Future orientation toward food system transformation
    Given Marcus experiences food system failures personally
    And he is developing values and political consciousness
    When Marcus reflects on food systems
    Then he should envision better alternatives
    And the personal_agent should present possibilities for transformation
    And it should explain food sovereignty and community agriculture
    And his generation should expect fundamental food system change
    And care economy should provide framework for reimagining food systems
    And his current struggles should fuel commitment to creating just alternatives
