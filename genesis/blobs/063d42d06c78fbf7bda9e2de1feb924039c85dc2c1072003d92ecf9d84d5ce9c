Scenario: Creating intergenerational connections in neighborhood
    Given Margaret engages with neighbors of all ages
    And she bridges generational divides through relationships
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks social connections
    Then it should recognize Margaret's role in intergenerational connection
    And it should value her relationships with children, parents, and elders
    And she should help create all-ages neighborhood culture
    And intergenerational mixing should strengthen neighborhood resilience
    And Margaret's social bridging should be recognized as care work
    And neighborhood should benefit from cross-generational relationships
