    Given Emma is working on a science fair project about local ecology
    And several classmates are working on related projects
    When Emma creates a contribution about discovering salamanders in the creek
    And she shares photos and observations with classmates
    Then the contribution reaches her project team immediately
    And her teacher can provide feedback and guidance
    And the learning agent surfaces related educational resources
    And Emma learns collaborative research skills
    And the project documentation is preserved for science fair presentation
