Scenario: Workers set quality standards democratically, not corporate mandates
    Given corporate enforced speed metrics that eroded quality
    And workers value quality and customer satisfaction over transaction speed
    When workers establish their own quality standards
    Then worker council defines quality metrics emphasizing care and excellence
    And workers reject corporate-style speedup pressure
    And customer feedback is incorporated through democratic review
    And workers balance efficiency with dignity and quality
    And workplace_elohim ensures standards maintain business sustainability
