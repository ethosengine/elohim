Scenario: Family governance decisions made collaboratively
    Given family faces major decisions about parent care
    And decisions affect multiple family members
    And Robert's voice carries weight but shouldn't dominate
    When family_elohim facilitates governance decisions
    Then it should support collaborative family decision-making
    And ensure Robert's parents have voice in their own care
    And include siblings in care planning decisions
    And respect adult children's emerging voice in family governance
    And help family navigate power dynamics and competing needs
    And support decisions that honor all family members' wellbeing
    And prevent decisions that sacrifice one generation for another
