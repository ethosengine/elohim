Scenario: Learning bioregional ecological patterns
    Given Kenji lives in specific bioregion with unique ecology
    And bioregional awareness is core to ecological care
    When the bioregional_elohim teaches about local ecology
    Then it should help Kenji learn local watershed, species, and ecosystems
    And it should connect him to bioregional natural patterns
    And it should show seasonal changes and ecological cycles
    And it should build his sense of place in bioregional context
    And the system should foster bioregional ecological literacy
    And Kenji should understand himself as member of bioregional community
