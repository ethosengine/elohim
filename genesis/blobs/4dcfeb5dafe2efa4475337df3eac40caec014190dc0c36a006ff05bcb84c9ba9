Scenario: Advocating for worker and environmental justice together
    Given worker exploitation and environmental exploitation are connected
    When I organize for worker dignity and fair compensation
    Then the protocol should help me connect labor justice to ecological justice
    And recognize that care economy serves both human and ecological flourishing
    And support advocacy that addresses both worker conditions and environmental sustainability
    And build movements connecting labor rights and environmental protection
