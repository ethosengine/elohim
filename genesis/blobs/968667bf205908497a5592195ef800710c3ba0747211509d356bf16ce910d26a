Scenario: Preparing for role reversal as parent-child relationship evolves
    Given Robert's parents increasingly need his care
    And he remembers them caring for him as a child
    And he recognizes his children will someday care for him
    When Robert reflects on lifecycle care patterns
    Then his personal_agent should help him navigate the emotional complexity
    And surface the reciprocity: "Your parents cared for you, you care for them, your children will care for you"
    And support him in maintaining his parents' dignity as he assumes care responsibilities
    And help him model dignified care receiving for his children
    And recognize that role reversal is natural lifecycle transition
    And validate the grief and complexity of watching parents age
    And prepare him for his own eventual care needs
