Scenario: Bioregional food system serves as climate resilience infrastructure
    Given climate disruption threatens food security through crop failures and supply chain breakdown
    And communities need resilient local food production capacity
    When democratic bioregional farm network provides distributed food security
    Then climate shocks are absorbed through network coordination
    And crop failures at individual farms don't create community food insecurity
    And bioregional food sovereignty provides climate resilience
    And food security is protected as climate changes through democratic coordination
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates climate resilience and food security planning
