Scenario: Municipal employer influenced through employee advocacy
    Given municipal government is major employer
    And Robert may work for municipality or know municipal employees
    And municipal employment policy sets standards
    When municipal_elohim supports workplace advocacy
    Then it should recognize opportunities to influence municipal employment policy
    And help Robert advocate for municipal employee work-family balance
    And support municipal adoption of care economy employment practices
    And demonstrate that municipal government should model care economy principles
    And build municipal workplace that supports employee caregiving
    And create demonstration that care-friendly employment is possible
    And influence broader employment culture through municipal example
