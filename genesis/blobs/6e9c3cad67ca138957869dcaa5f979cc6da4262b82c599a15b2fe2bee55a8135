Scenario: Workplace recognition of caregiver constraints on employment
    Given James can only work ~20 hours/week due to caregiving
    And his availability is constrained by care needs
    When the workplace_elohim communicates with employers
    Then James's caregiving situation should be visible to employer
    And his reduced availability should be explained as care-related
    And employer should understand caregiving constraints on capacity
    And caregiver status should be recognized as legitimate limit
    And workplace should accommodate caregiving realities
