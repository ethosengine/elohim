Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained with full data portability
    Given Sarah has been using the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Sarah chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then the system must honor disconnection immediately
    And she should receive complete data export of all her information
    And no manipulative retention patterns should be employed
    And her right to not participate must be absolute
    And data portability should enable switching to alternative systems
