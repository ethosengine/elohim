Scenario: Coordinating neighborhood childcare exchange
    Given Sarah needs occasional childcare coverage
    And she can provide childcare for others in exchange
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates childcare sharing
    Then it should match parents for reciprocal childcare
    And it should track care provided and received
    And it should ensure exchanges are equitable over time
    And childcare cooperation should be visible and valued
    And parents should support each other sustainably
    And neighborhood care economy should reduce childcare costs
