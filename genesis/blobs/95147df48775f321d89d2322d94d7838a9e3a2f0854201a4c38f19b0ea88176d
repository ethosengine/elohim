Scenario: Privacy controls for adult financial independence
    Given Aisha has full adult autonomy
    And she wants to keep financial details private
    When Aisha configures her privacy settings
    Then she should have complete control over data sharing
    And her financial information should remain private by default
    And she should explicitly consent to any family visibility
    And workplace should have no access to personal data
    And privacy controls should be granular and transparent
    And the system should respect her adult independence
