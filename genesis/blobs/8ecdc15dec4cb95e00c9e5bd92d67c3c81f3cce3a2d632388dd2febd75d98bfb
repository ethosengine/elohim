Scenario: Recognizing my labor as care contribution
    Given I prepare food that nourishes people and serves community
    When I view my work through care economy lens
    Then the protocol should help me understand my work as care labor
    And accumulate care tokens reflecting my contribution to community well-being
    And reframe my relationship to work from pure exploitation to meaningful service
    And build consciousness that my labor deserves dignity and fair compensation
