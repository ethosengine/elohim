Scenario: Developing critical thinking about consumption and marketing
    Given consumer marketing targets young adults intensively
    And Aisha needs media literacy
    When Aisha encounters marketing messages
    Then the personal_agent should help her think critically
    And it should explain marketing tactics and manipulation
    And it should teach distinguishing needs from manufactured wants
    And consumer education should support autonomous decision-making
    And she should learn to resist exploitative marketing
    And critical consumption literacy should be developed
