Scenario: Journalist develops whistleblower source on environmental violations
    Given an employee witnesses company illegally dumping waste
    And fears job loss for reporting violations
    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel
    Then the whistleblower shares evidence of illegal dumping
    And journalist investigates without exposing source
    And verifies claims through regulatory records and site investigation
    And publishes investigation leading to enforcement action
    And source protection enables environmental accountability
