Scenario: Accessing neighborhood food assistance with dignity
    Given I need supplemental food support beyond my grocery budget
    And neighborhood has food pantries, community meals, or assistance programs
    When I seek food assistance in my neighborhood
    Then the Value Scanner helps me locate and access food resources
    And provides information about pantry hours, requirements, and culture
    And prepares me for what to expect to reduce anxiety
    And frames food assistance as community care economy, not charity
    And tracks my care contributions that create standing for support
    And my personal_agent helps me navigate first visits
    And recognizes accessing help as strength, not failure
    And connects me to most dignity-preserving food resources
