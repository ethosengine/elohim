Scenario: Providing audit access to deep technical details
    Given I need to verify agent decision pathway for appeal
    And I have deeper access than ordinary citizens
    When I examine agent source code, decision logs, and cryptographic proofs
    Then my access is: logged and transparent
    And I can: examine but not modify systems
    And I verify: whether agent followed claimed constitutional principles
    And I check: cryptographic proof validity
    And I identify: any technical vulnerabilities or errors
    And my audit: is itself auditable by other experts
    And deep access: serves genuine oversight not manipulation
