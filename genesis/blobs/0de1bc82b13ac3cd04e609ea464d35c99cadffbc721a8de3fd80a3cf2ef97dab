Scenario: Longitudinal global study tracking generational transformation
    Given I study whether protocol transforms civic culture across generations
    And Tommy's generation is growing up with democratic AI governance
    When I track generational cohorts over 20-30 years
    Then I examine: civic capacities (constitutional literacy, deliberation skills)
    And I assess: political participation and democratic engagement
    And I measure: relationship to AI and technology
    And I explore: whether growing up with protocol creates different citizenship
    And I analyze: intergenerational transmission of democratic culture
    And I investigate: whether protocol's effects compound across generations
    And My research captures: civilizational transformation over human timescales
