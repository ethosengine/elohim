Feature: Community Participation and Wisdom Sharing for Elder
  As an elder in the social_medium system
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to participate in community life and share my experience
  So that I remain engaged, valued, and connected while contributing wisdom

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elder user is registered in the system
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And Rose, age 73, lives in the Riverside neighborhood

  Scenario: Elder shares traditional skill with neighborhood
    Given Rose is an expert seamstress with 60 years experience
    When she offers to teach mending and sewing skills
    And she creates a contribution proposing weekly sewing circles
    Then the contribution reaches her neighborhood
    And community members interested in learning can respond
    And a neighborhood sewing circle forms with Rose as mentor
    And Rose experiences being valued for her knowledge
    And traditional skills are preserved and transmitted

  Scenario: Elder protected from Medicare scam
    Given scammers are running fake Medicare enrollment campaigns
    When a scammer tries to contact Rose about "urgent" Medicare changes
    And the message requests personal information and payment
    Then the guardian agent identifies the scam pattern
    And the fraudulent message never reaches Rose
    And Rose is protected without awareness of the threat
    And legitimate Medicare communications work normally
    And her real healthcare connections remain intact

  Scenario: Elder coordinates neighborhood elder check-in system
    Given several elders in the neighborhood live alone
    And Rose wants to ensure everyone has daily connection
    When Rose proposes a daily elder check-in system
    And volunteers agree to participate in rotation
    Then the coordination agent helps organize the schedule
    And each elder receives daily contact from neighbors
    And any concerns are immediately surfaced to family and community
    And Rose experiences agency in building community care
    And isolation is prevented through systematic connection

  Scenario: Elder's institutional memory aids community decision
    Given the neighborhood is debating a proposed development
    And there are questions about past flooding patterns
    When Rose contributes her memory of the 1995 flood
    And she describes how the proposed site was underwater
    Then her historical knowledge is valued in the discussion
    And her contribution earns reach based on relevance and credibility
    And the community makes better-informed decisions
    And Rose experiences being an essential community asset
    And institutional memory is preserved and utilized
