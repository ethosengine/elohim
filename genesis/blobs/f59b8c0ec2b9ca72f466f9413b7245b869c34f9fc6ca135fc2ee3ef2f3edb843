Scenario: Climate grief and loss acknowledged in elderly experience
    Given Helen has witnessed massive environmental change
    And loss of familiar ecosystems causes grief
    When Helen expresses climate grief
    Then her emotional response should be validated and supported
    And loss of familiar nature should be acknowledged as legitimate grief
    And the protocol should recognize that elders witness most environmental loss
    And climate change impacts include psychological dimensions
    And Helen's grief should be honored, not dismissed
    And witnessing ecological destruction across lifetime should be recognized as trauma
    And elder perspectives should inform community understanding of what's being lost
