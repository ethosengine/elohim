Scenario: Coordinating informal grandchild care sharing with neighbors
    Given Margaret cares for her grandchildren regularly
    And other neighborhood grandparents also provide childcare
    When Margaret coordinates with other grandparents
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate care coordination
    And it should help grandparents share resources and support
    And it should enable mutual aid among neighborhood grandparents
    And grandparents should form care networks for collective benefit
    And neighborhood care economy should strengthen through elder collaboration
    And Margaret should connect with other grandparents in similar roles
