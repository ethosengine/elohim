Scenario: Neighbor coordination for carpooling and activity transportation
    Given Maria struggles with impossible logistics of three children's different schedules
    And she has no partner to split transportation duties
    When children need transportation to school, activities, and appointments
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate carpooling with other families
    And it should match families with compatible schedules and destinations
    And it should track reciprocal transportation contributions
    And carpooling should reduce Maria's impossible logistics burden
    And neighborhood coordination should make solo parenting more manageable
