Scenario: Housing authority board member evaluates mixed-income development policy
    Given authority considers policy requiring mixed-income units in new developments
    And staff presents complex financing and legal considerations
    And board member wants to make informed decision but has limited affordable housing expertise
    When the board member uses Observer accessible expertise
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of mixed-income development models
    And see examples from peer housing authorities with outcomes data
    And access key trade-offs between requiring affordability and reducing development
    And get questions to ask staff about implementation and enforcement
    And accessible expertise enables informed policy judgment
