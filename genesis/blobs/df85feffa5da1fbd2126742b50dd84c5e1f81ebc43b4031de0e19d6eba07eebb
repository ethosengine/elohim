Scenario: Transportation coordination enables neighborhood mobility
    Given Helen no longer drives
    And public transit is limited or inaccessible
    When Helen needs to get to local appointments or events
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate rides with neighbors
    And volunteer drivers should be matched based on schedule compatibility
    And Helen should maintain ability to participate in neighborhood life
    And transportation barriers should not cause isolation
    And driver care work should be recognized
    And the protocol should solve last-mile transportation through care economy
    And neighborhood networks should provide mobility infrastructure
