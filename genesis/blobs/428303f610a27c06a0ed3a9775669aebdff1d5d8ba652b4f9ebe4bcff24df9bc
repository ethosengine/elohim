Scenario: Teacher connects state policy to classroom impacts
    Given state cut education budget by $400M this year
    And politicians claim "no impact on classroom instruction"
    When teachers document actual classroom impacts through Observer
    Then statewide data shows 1,200 teaching positions eliminated
    And class sizes increased average 3 students per class
    And art/music/counseling programs cut in 40% of districts
    And teachers connect budget abstraction to learning reality
    And teacher evidence exposes political rhetoric vs classroom truth
