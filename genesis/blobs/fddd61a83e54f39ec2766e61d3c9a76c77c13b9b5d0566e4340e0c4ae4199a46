Scenario: Household consumption patterns analyzed for ecological impact
    Given Robert's household consumes resources and generates waste
    And consumption choices affect ecological systems
    And middle-aged adults often have highest consumption footprint
    When bioregional_elohim analyzes household ecological impact
    Then it should track resource consumption, energy use, and waste generation
    And surface patterns: "Your household consumes 40% above bioregional sustainable average"
    And help Robert understand ecological impact of consumption choices
    And connect consumption to bioregional carrying capacity
    And support reduction strategies that maintain quality of life
    And demonstrate that care economy includes ecological care
    And build household practices that serve bioregional health
