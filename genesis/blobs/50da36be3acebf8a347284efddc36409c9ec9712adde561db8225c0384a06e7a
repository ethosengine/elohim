Scenario: Managing fixed income with dignity and sophisticated tools
    Given Frank has $140/week grocery budget for two people
    And his income is fixed at ~$28k/year and cannot be increased through employment
    And he needs to maintain nutrition as dietary needs change with age
    When Frank plans his household shopping
    Then his personal_agent should provide sophisticated budgeting tools
    And it should identify sales and optimize value per dollar
    And it should track spending patterns across weeks and months
    And it should suggest resource optimization without stigma or shame
    And it should help maintain quality of life within real constraints
    And the framing should be dignity-preserving, not scarcity-shaming
    And Frank should experience agency and resourcefulness, not deprivation
