Scenario: Customer relationships institutionalize beyond individual owner
    Given Rosa built customer loyalty through personal trust over 15 years
    And these relationships are valuable but currently dependent on her
    When customer relationship transition process begins
    Then Rosa introduces workers to customers as new business leaders
    And customer histories are documented (with privacy protection)
    And workers learn customer preferences and build direct relationships
    And customers discover democratic ownership often deepens their loyalty
    And relationships survive and strengthen beyond Rosa's involvement
