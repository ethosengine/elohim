Scenario: Neighborhood respite network for caregiver breaks
    Given James needs regular breaks or he will burn out
    And formal respite care is expensive and hard to access
    When the neighborhood_elohim organizes respite network
    Then it should coordinate neighbors willing to provide respite
    And it should schedule regular respite periods for James
    And neighbors should be trained for basic Alzheimer's care
    And respite should be reliable and consistent
    And neighborhood should provide systematic respite support
