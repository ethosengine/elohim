Scenario: Teacher exposes planning time inequities across schools
    Given some schools provide adequate planning time while others don't
    And teachers don't know if their conditions are typical or problematic
    When the Observer documents planning time across district
    Then teachers see stark disparities (30 min vs 90 min daily planning)
    And identify which principals prioritize teacher planning time
    And understand patterns (wealthy schools get more planning time)
    And coordinate advocacy for district-wide planning time standards
    And working conditions comparison drives equity
