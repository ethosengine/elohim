Scenario: Pension board member prepares for decision on emerging market investments
    Given investment staff recommends increasing allocation to emerging markets
    And recommendation includes complex analysis of risk-adjusted returns
    And board member wants to make informed fiduciary decision but lacks investment expertise
    When the board member uses Observer decision support
    Then they receive executive summary of emerging market investment considerations
    And see performance and volatility data from peer pension funds' allocations
    And access key questions to ask investment staff about risk management
    And understand how proposed allocation fits pension fund's overall strategy
    And accessible expertise enables informed fiduciary judgment
