Scenario: Building neighborhood connections that might endure beyond crisis
    Given I might move to permanent housing in this neighborhood or elsewhere
    And relationships I build now could become long-term community
    When I invest in neighborhood relationships
    Then the Value Scanner helps me identify connections worth developing
    And supports authentic relationship-building despite uncertainty
    And validates that building community is valuable regardless of housing permanence
    And helps me maintain connections if I move within neighborhood
    And facilitates staying connected if I move to different neighborhood
    And my personal_agent tracks meaningful neighborhood relationships
    And recognizes community-building as important social infrastructure work
    And celebrates relationships that provide support and belonging
