Scenario: Anonymous franchise locations become known community institutions
    Given ChickenMax #247, #248, #249 were corporate outposts without local identity
    And community members saw them as extractive chains, not neighborhood businesses
    When conversion makes locations democratically-governed community institutions
    Then neighborhoods learn their franchise locations chose democratic ownership
    And locations develop distinct community identities (possibly rebranding with local names)
    And community members recognize workers as co-owners, not exploited employees
    And institutions become sources of neighborhood pride instead of corporate extraction symbols
    And community_elohim communicates conversion story building community ownership
