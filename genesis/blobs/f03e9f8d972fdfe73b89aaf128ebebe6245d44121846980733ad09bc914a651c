Scenario: Family financial coordination for retirement on fixed income
    Given Frank lives on fixed income of $28k/year
    And he occasionally provides financial support to adult children
    And he's managing his mother-in-law's care costs
    When family_elohim coordinates financial flows
    Then it should track Frank's financial contributions to family
    And surface when financial support compromises his own security
    And help family understand his economic constraints
    And facilitate honest conversations about financial capacity
    And protect Frank from unsustainable financial requests
    And ensure his fixed income sustains his own household first
