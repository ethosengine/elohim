Scenario: Neighborhood food cooperative formation includes preteen family
    Given a food cooperative is forming in Marcus's neighborhood
    And cooperative buying could reduce his family's grocery costs
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies the opportunity
    Then Marcus's family should be informed about the cooperative
    And the notification should say "A food cooperative is forming—your participation would strengthen it"
    And Marcus's care contributions should qualify family for membership
    And cooperative participation should reduce his budget constraints
    And neighborhood coordination should reduce individual family burden
    And Marcus should learn that collective action creates better outcomes
