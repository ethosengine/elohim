Scenario: Buying quality that lasts reduces ecological impact
    Given Margaret learned to buy fewer, better things
    And durability reduces waste and resource extraction
    When Margaret makes purchasing decisions
    Then her personal_agent should support quality-over-quantity choices
    And the bioregional_elohim should track durability practices
    And buying quality should be recognized as ecological stewardship
    And Margaret's knowledge of durability should inform others
    And consumption patterns should favor longevity
    And throwaway culture should be countered by senior wisdom
