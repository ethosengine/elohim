Feature: Labor and Economic Justice Journalism for Journalist
  As a journalist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer
  I want comprehensive labor surveillance and economic data
  So that labor journalism holds employers and regulators accountable

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the journalist user is registered in the system
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active

  Scenario: Journalist monitors labor board and regulatory hearings
    Given the journalist covers labor and employment
    And must track labor board, wage enforcement, OSHA, and related agencies
    When the Observer monitors all labor regulatory agencies
    Then the journalist reviews all violation cases and enforcement actions
    And receives alerts for significant labor violations
    And tracks patterns in enforcement and employer violations
    And comprehensive labor accountability coverage becomes sustainable
    And worker exploitation cannot hide in regulatory obscurity

  Scenario: Journalist exposes wage theft pattern across employers
    Given workers report unpaid wages and overtime violations
    And the journalist investigates wage theft
    When the Observer analyzes wage violation enforcement data
    Then the journalist sees systematic wage theft across multiple employers
    And identifies industries with concentrated violations
    And documents millions in stolen wages and minimal enforcement
    And shows workers of color disproportionately affected
    And publishes investigation exposing wage theft epidemic

  Scenario: Journalist investigates workplace safety violations
    Given workers report unsafe conditions at warehouse
    And the journalist covers workplace safety
    When the Observer analyzes employer's safety violation history
    Then the journalist finds company has 47 OSHA violations in 5 years
    And sees pattern of violations detected but minimally fined
    And documents worker injuries and company's inadequate response
    And shows same company violates safety rules at facilities in other states
    And publishes investigation forcing regulatory accountability

  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks employer claims during union campaign
    Given workers organize union at major retailer
    And employer makes claims about wages and benefits
    When the Observer provides instant fact-checking against labor data
    Then the journalist verifies wage claim is misleading (includes management)
    And finds actual frontline worker wages below poverty level
    And shows benefits exclude most workers due to hour restrictions
    And identifies employer's union-busting expenditures
    And publishes real-time fact-check supporting informed worker vote

  Scenario: Journalist tracks economic development promises to accountability
    Given company received tax incentives for job creation
    And the journalist covered initial economic development announcement
    When the Observer monitors job creation and wage outcomes
    Then the journalist finds company created 40% of promised jobs
    And sees wages are lower than promised in tax incentive agreement
    And documents tax breaks cost more than economic benefit
    And identifies lack of enforcement from economic development agency
    And publishes accountability story on corporate welfare waste

  Scenario: Journalist exposes misclassification of workers as contractors
    Given gig economy companies classify workers as independent contractors
    And the journalist investigates worker classification
    When the Observer analyzes employment patterns and labor violations
    Then the journalist sees workers have employer control without worker rights
    And documents workers denied minimum wage, overtime, and benefits
    And shows companies avoid taxes through misclassification
    And identifies regulatory agencies failing to enforce classification rules
    And publishes investigation on worker exploitation through misclassification

  Scenario: Journalist develops worker sources on retaliation
    Given workers face retaliation for organizing or complaining
    And fear job loss for speaking to journalist
    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel
    Then workers share evidence of retaliation and illegal firings
    And journalist investigates without exposing individual sources
    And aggregates worker experiences to show pattern
    And verifies claims through labor board records
    And publishes investigation protecting sources while exposing employer
    And source protection enables workers to speak truth

  Scenario: Journalist investigates regional economic inequality patterns
    Given the journalist covers regional economy
    And economic growth statistics mask inequality
    When the Observer analyzes economic data by demographics and geography
    Then the journalist sees wage growth concentrated in top income brackets
    And documents working-class wage stagnation despite economic growth claims
    And shows poverty increasing in communities of color despite job growth
    And identifies industries paying poverty wages receiving subsidies
    And publishes investigation exposing economic inequality
    And pattern recognition reveals who benefits from "strong economy"
