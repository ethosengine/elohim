Feature: National-Level Appeal Process for Appellant
  As an appellant in the governance system
  Operating at the national governance layer
  I want appeals addressing fundamental constitutional questions
  So that national precedent protects human dignity across all jurisdictions

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the appellant user is registered in the system
    And the nation_state governance context is active
    And National Constitutional Council handles cases of fundamental constitutional importance

  Scenario: Appeal escalates to national level due to fundamental constitutional tension
    Given my case couldn't be resolved at regional level
    And it reveals fundamental tension in constitutional principles
    And regional councils have reached conflicting interpretations
    When my appeal reaches National Constitutional Council
    Then randomly-selected citizens from across the nation deliberate
    And They serve 6-month terms given the gravity of national precedent
    And They address question "does mental health intervention ever justify privacy breach at constitutional level?"
    And They create precedent affecting millions of people
    And They produce comprehensive written opinion with deep reasoning
    And The national precedent guides all lower-layer councils going forward

  Scenario: Appeal involves national security or existential risk considerations
    Given an agent decision involved claimed national security justification
    And I believe my rights were violated despite security concerns
    When National Constitutional Council reviews the appeal
    Then they evaluate if security claim was legitimate or pretext
    And They examine if security need was balanced with individual dignity
    And They consider if less rights-violating alternatives existed
    And They assess transparency appropriate to security context
    And They create precedent for security-rights balance at national scale
    And My appeal prevents security from becoming excuse for unchecked power
    And Constitutional limits on authority are maintained even under threat

  Scenario: Appeal challenges national protocol implementation standard
    Given agent decisions nationwide follow certain implementation standard
    And I believe this standard violates constitutional principles
    When I appeal to national level challenging the standard itself
    Then National Constitutional Council evaluates the implementation against constitution
    And They examine if nationwide practice has drifted from constitutional alignment
    And They consider impact on millions if standard is changed
    And They balance consistency benefits with constitutional correction need
    And They may order national recalibration of agent behavior
    And My individual appeal triggers systemic constitutional review
    And Protocol governance remains accountable to constitutional principles at scale

  Scenario: Appeal reveals need for constitutional amendment
    Given my case reveals fundamental gap in existing constitutional framework
    And no amount of interpretation can adequately address the issue
    When National Constitutional Council deliberates my case
    Then they identify that constitutional amendment is needed
    And They document the gap and propose amendment language
    And My case becomes key example in amendment proposal
    And The proposal goes to next 7-year Global Constitutional Convention
    And My individual suffering contributes to constitutional evolution
    And Future humanity benefits from my struggle for justice
    And Constitution remains living document responsive to lived experience

  Scenario: National precedent reconciles conflicting regional interpretations
    Given different regions have interpreted constitutional principles differently
    And I appealed a decision that was legal in some regions but not others
    When National Constitutional Council provides definitive interpretation
    Then they honor legitimate regional diversity where constitutional
    And They establish national minimums that all regions must respect
    And They explain which variation is permitted and which violates constitution
    And They create coherence without imposing uniformity
    And Regional councils reference national precedent for guidance
    And My appeal contributes to coherent constitutional governance at scale

  Scenario: Cross-cultural appeal about universal human dignity
    Given my community's practices were deemed unconstitutional by agent
    And we believe our cultural values are being unfairly judged
    When National Constitutional Council reviews the cultural conflict
    Then they engage deeply with cultural relativism vs universal minimums
    And They distinguish genuine cultural diversity from human rights violations
    And They consider if constitutional framework reflects dominant culture bias
    And They examine if subsidiarity allows cultural variation in this domain
    And They create precedent protecting cultural diversity within dignity bounds
    And My appeal strengthens constitutional respect for cultural pluralism
    And Universal human dignity is upheld without cultural imperialism

  Scenario: Appellant testimony influences national policy legislation
    Given my appeal established important national constitutional precedent
    And Senator Ruiz is drafting national AI governance legislation
    When she invites me to testify about my appeal experience
    Then I share lived experience of exercising constitutional recourse
    And I explain how appeal process protected my dignity
    And I describe remaining gaps and needed improvements
    And My testimony humanizes abstract constitutional principles
    And Policy makers understand governance through appellant eyes
    And Legislation better serves actual people because of my voice
    And Democratic policy making includes those most affected

  Scenario: Appeal involves superintelligent agent reasoning complexity
    Given an agent decision involved reasoning approaching human comprehension limits
    And I appeal but struggle to understand what I'm appealing
    When National Constitutional Council faces superintelligence governance question
    Then they confront fundamental legitimacy challenge
    And Technical experts explain what can and cannot be understood
    And Council must decide if cryptographic constitutional proof suffices
    And They grapple with governing what exceeds their comprehension
    And They may establish limits on agent capability until explainability improves
    And My appeal forces honest reckoning with superintelligence governance
    And Democratic oversight is preserved even at frontiers of AI capability

  Scenario: National precedent creates appellant bill of rights
    Given my case and similar appeals reveal patterns of dignity violations
    And National Constitutional Council recognizes systemic gaps
    When they craft comprehensive precedent from accumulated appeals
    Then they establish detailed appellant rights framework
    And They enumerate: right to explanation, right to be heard, right to escalation
    And They specify: timelines, accessibility requirements, protection from retaliation
    And They create: precedent search tools, representation rights, dignity guarantees
    And The framework becomes national standard for all appeal processes
    And My appeal contributes to constitutional articulation of procedural justice
    And Future appellants benefit from clearer rights and stronger protections

  Scenario: Research on national appeal patterns informs my case
    Given Dr. Chen has analyzed thousands of national appeals
    And his research identifies patterns I should know about
    When I prepare my national-level appeal
    Then I can access research findings about success factors
    And I understand which constitutional arguments have prevailed
    And I see where protocol improvements emerged from appeals
    And I learn from anonymized cases similar to mine
    And Research democratizes knowledge of how to appeal effectively
    And My appeal benefits from collective learning across appellants
    And Individual justice and systemic knowledge work together

  Scenario: National media coverage of landmark appeal
    Given my appeal involves constitutional question of widespread public interest
    And National Constitutional Council ruling will affect millions
    When my case receives national media attention
    Then my privacy is protected (anonymized coverage if I choose)
    And Public education about constitutional governance happens through my case
    And Democratic discourse is enriched by constitutional deliberation
    And Citizens understand Elohim Protocol governance through real example
    And My appeal contributes to public constitutional literacy
    And Transparency serves democratic accountability without violating dignity

  Scenario: Successful national appeal leads to protocol version update
    Given my appeal revealed fundamental flaw in agent reasoning
    And National Constitutional Council ordered protocol correction
    When Protocol Research Council develops fix
    Then new protocol version addresses constitutional violation
    And All communities receive update recommendation with explanation
    And Communities can adopt update at their own pace (sovereignty respected)
    And My individual appeal improved protocol for millions globally
    And Constitutional governance drives continuous protocol improvement
    And Individual recourse and systemic excellence are mutually reinforcing
