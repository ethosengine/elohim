Scenario: Citizen participates in zoning decision with real-time context
    Given a city council meeting is discussing zoning changes
    And the citizen is following virtually during dinner
    When officials and developers make claims
    Then the Observer provides real-time fact-checking
    And shows what "efficient development" actually means for residents
    And calculates community costs hidden in presentations
    And surfaces conflicts of interest (donations, relationships)
    And informed participation happens in real-time
