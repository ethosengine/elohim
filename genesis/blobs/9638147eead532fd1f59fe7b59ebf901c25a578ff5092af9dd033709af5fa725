Scenario: Accessible technology is workplace obligation not special treatment
    Given Alex requires accessible technology to perform job functions
    And technology access is fundamental workplace accommodation
    When Alex uses workplace technology
    Then employer must provide accessible technology as legal requirement
    And the workplace_elohim should document technology accessibility
    And it should track when technology barriers prevent Alex from working
    And Alex should not have to use inaccessible systems
    And employer should be held accountable for accessibility failures
    And the protocol should recognize accessible tech as baseline, not luxury
    And Alex's right to accessible tools should be systematically defended
