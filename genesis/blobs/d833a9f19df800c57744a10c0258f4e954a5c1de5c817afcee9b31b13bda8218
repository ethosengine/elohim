Scenario: Community resilience increases through local food production capacity
    Given communities dependent on global supply chains are vulnerable to disruption
    And COVID-19 demonstrated fragility of corporate food system

    Then community is less vulnerable to supply chain disruptions
    And local food production capacity serves as resilience infrastructure
    And crisis response can prioritize community feeding over profit
    And democratic governance ensures farm serves community needs during emergencies
