Scenario: Accessing community resources without invasive means-testing
    Given traditional social services require proving I'm "needy enough"
    And care economy provides support based on different principles
    When I access community resources through care economy
    Then the Value Scanner provides access based on care participation, not means-testing
    And doesn't require exposing private trauma to gatekeepers
    And validates my care contributions as basis for receiving support
    And preserves my privacy and dignity
    And connects me to resources efficiently without bureaucratic barriers
    And my personal_agent helps me navigate with minimal burden
    And recognizes that care economy support differs from institutional charity
    And provides dignified alternative to degrading social services
