Scenario: Managing family crisis with supported participation
    Given there's a family emergency requiring quick decisions
    And Jordan's input is important but time is limited
    When the family gathers to respond to the crisis
    Then the personal_agent helps Jordan understand the situation quickly
    And the interface presents information in most accessible format
    And Jordan's voice is heard even under time pressure
    And the family doesn't automatically exclude Jordan from decisions
    And supported decision-making works even in crisis
    And Jordan's family membership is honored in difficult times
