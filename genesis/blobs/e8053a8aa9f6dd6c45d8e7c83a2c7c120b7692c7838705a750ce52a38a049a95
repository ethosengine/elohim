Scenario: Workers democratically hire new team members
    Given ChickenMax needs to hire an additional worker
    And hiring was previously manager's unilateral decision
    When the hiring process begins
    Then workers collectively develop job description and qualifications
    And multiple workers participate in interviewing candidates
    And workers evaluate candidates based on skill fit and values alignment
    And final hiring decision requires worker council approval
    And new hires integrate into democratic culture from day one
