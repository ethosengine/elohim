Feature: District Governance for Board Member
  As a board member serving on a district board in the public_observer system
  Operating at the district governance layer
  I want independent analysis and accessible expertise for district-wide decisions
  So that I can exercise informed judgment on consequential policies affecting thousands of constituents

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the board_member user is registered in the system
    And the district governance context is active
    And I am a volunteer serving on a school board or special district board

  Scenario: Board member receives independent analysis of staff budget recommendation
    Given district superintendent recommends budget with significant program cuts
    And 200-page budget packet emphasizes efficiency and fiscal responsibility
    And board meeting is in 3 days with vote expected
    When the board member requests Observer independent analysis
    Then they receive concise summary identifying key trade-offs staff minimized
    And see comparison of per-student spending across district schools showing disparities
    And access data on community impacts of proposed cuts by demographic group
    And get examples of how similar districts managed budget challenges differently
    And independent analysis reveals information asymmetry in staff presentation

  Scenario: Board member learns accessible expertise on complex water infrastructure decision
    Given water district faces decision on $50M infrastructure upgrade
    And engineering staff presentation uses technical jargon and assumptions
    And board member has no engineering background but must vote responsibly
    When the board member uses Observer to understand the decision
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of technical trade-offs
    And see comparison of infrastructure approaches used by similar districts
    And access key questions to ask staff about cost estimates and alternatives
    And get context on long-term maintenance and rate impacts
    And accessible expertise enables informed decision without full-time study

  Scenario: Board member tracks implementation of previous transportation policy
    Given board voted two years ago to optimize bus routes for efficiency
    And transportation director promised improved reliability and cost savings
    And parents increasingly complain about late buses and long routes
    When the board member checks Observer implementation tracking
    Then they see on-time performance has actually declined since policy change
    And discover cost savings didn't materialize as promised
    And find low-income neighborhoods disproportionately affected by route changes
    And access parent feedback data showing systematic reliability problems
    And impact tracking reveals staff promises diverged from actual outcomes

  Scenario: Board member detects potential conflict of interest in vendor contract
    Given district staff recommends contract with technology vendor
    And recommendation emphasizes vendor qualifications and competitive pricing
    And board will vote on $2M multi-year contract next meeting
    When the board member uses Observer to review the recommendation
    Then they discover vendor donated to superintendent's previous campaigns
    And see vendor's track record in other districts shows implementation problems
    And find contract terms more favorable to vendor than peer district contracts
    And access data showing alternative vendors with better performance
    And capture protection makes conflict of interest and manipulation visible

  Scenario: Board member understands community priorities beyond meeting testimony
    Given board considers policy change to school calendar
    And testimony at meeting is dominated by teachers union advocating position
    And only 15 community members attended to testify
    When the board member seeks community accountability data from Observer
    Then they see survey data from thousands of district families on calendar preferences
    And discover working families have different priorities than those who testified
    And access childcare impact analysis showing consequences for different populations
    And understand community needs beyond who has time to attend meetings
    And community accountability helps board serve diverse constituent interests

  Scenario: Board member compares district performance to jurisdictional peers
    Given board reviews annual student achievement and equity data
    And superintendent presents results emphasizing positive trends
    And board wants to understand if district is truly serving all students well
    When the board member uses Observer cross-district comparison
    Then they see district's achievement gaps larger than similar districts
    And discover other districts closed equity gaps while this one widened
    And access specific practices peer districts used to improve outcomes
    And identify areas where staff presentation masked concerning patterns
    And independent analysis helps board exercise meaningful oversight

  Scenario: Board member prepares for contentious development decision in special district
    Given transit district board must decide on major service expansion
    And developers advocate for routes serving new developments
    And existing riders advocate for frequency improvements on current routes
    And staff recommendation favors expansion over frequency
    When the board member uses Observer decision support
    Then they receive ridership data showing current overcrowding and reliability issues
    And see community benefits analysis comparing expansion versus improvement
    And access transportation equity analysis of who is served by each option
    And get examples of how peer transit districts approached similar trade-offs
    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment balancing competing interests
