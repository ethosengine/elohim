Scenario: Identifying implementation challenges through participant observation
    Given I am embedded in Riverside for six months
    And I observe daily reality of protocol implementation
    When I encounter challenges residents and leaders face
    Then I document: elderly residents struggling with technology
    And I note: three Constitutional Council decisions that residents opposed
    And I observe: recurring tension around adolescent autonomy
    And I identify: gaps between theory and practice
    And I analyze: what enables some communities to thrive while others struggle
    And My research reveals: practical wisdom about implementation
    And Findings help other communities avoid pitfalls Riverside encountered
