Scenario: Ecological care integrated with personal purchasing decisions
    Given Helen uses Value Scanner for shopping
    And her choices have environmental impact
    When Helen makes purchasing decisions
    Then ecological impact should be surfaced at appropriate cognitive level
    And her personal_agent should support environmentally conscious choices
    And information should be presented simply: "Local tomatoes from nearby farm"
    And ecological care should be framed as care for community
    And Helen should be supported in environmental stewardship within her capabilities
    And the protocol should enable ecological values in daily decisions
    And sustainability should be accessible regardless of cognitive limitations
