Scenario: Hearing testimony from Mayor Jamal about implementation reality
    Given I need ground truth about protocol in practice
    And Riverside provides three years of experience
    When Mayor Jamal testifies about community implementation
    Then he shares: what works (community calibration, constitutional oversight)
    And he describes: what struggles (elderly accessibility, controversy)
    And he explains: factors predicting adoption success
    And he provides: evidence countering corporate lobbyist claims
    And his testimony: grounds policy in lived reality
    And I learn: from practitioners not just theory
    And community voices: inform state legislation
