Scenario: Respite visits from neighbors to prevent social isolation
    Given James is profoundly socially isolated by caregiving
    And he desperately needs human connection
    When neighbors provide respite visits
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate visiting schedules
    And neighbors could stay with David briefly while James takes walk
    And they could provide social connection for both James and David
    And brief respite periods should be regular, not just emergency
    And neighborhood should actively prevent caregiver isolation
