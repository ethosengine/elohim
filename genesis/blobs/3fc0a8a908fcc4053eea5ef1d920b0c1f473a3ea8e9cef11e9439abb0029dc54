Scenario: Financial and resource management education for fixed income
    Given Margaret manages limited resources
    And financial literacy supports economic security
    When the educational_elohim provides financial education
    Then senior-specific financial planning should be available
    And budget management on fixed income should be taught
    And education should be empowering, not condescending
    And Margaret should learn strategies for resource optimization
    And financial literacy should support independence
    And education should be practical and immediately applicable
