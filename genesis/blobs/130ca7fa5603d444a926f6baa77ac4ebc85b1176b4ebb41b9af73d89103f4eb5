Scenario: Tracking nutritional needs as dietary requirements change with age
    Given Frank's dietary needs are changing as he ages
    And he needs more protein and fiber, less sodium
    And he's managing early indicators of health conditions
    When Frank shops for groceries on fixed budget
    Then his personal_agent should track nutrition across time
    And it should suggest foods appropriate for aging nutritional needs
    And it should flag items high in sodium or added sugars
    And it should highlight protein and fiber-rich options
    And it should balance health needs with budget constraints
    And nutritional guidance should feel supportive, not controlling
    And Frank should maintain full agency over food choices
