Scenario: Appealing community conflict mediation outcome
    Given Community Elohim mediated a conflict between me and neighbors
    And I believe the proposed resolution is unjust
    When I appeal the mediation outcome
    Then Constitutional Council reviews if mediation process was fair
    And They evaluate if all parties had meaningful voice
    And They examine if constitutional principles guided the resolution
    And They consider if community harmony was balanced with individual justice
    And They assess if cultural conflict resolution norms were respected
    And The appeal can modify the resolution or offer alternative mediation
    And Community learns how to balance harmony with individual rights
