Scenario: Care economy capital accumulation for community standing
    Given Margaret makes substantial community contributions
    And accumulated care tokens represent community standing
    When community decisions are made about resources or priorities
    Then Margaret's care contributions should give her voice
    And care economy should inform community governance
    And those who contribute care should have standing in decisions
    And community should operate on care economy principles
    And Margaret's service should be recognized in community leadership
    And care-based governance should be operational
