Scenario: Testifying about technical feasibility of constitutional minimums
    Given delegates establish universal constitutional minimums
    And technical implementation varies by context
    When I assess whether minimums are technically achievable globally
    Then I evaluate: what infrastructure different minimums require
    And I identify: barriers in low-resource contexts
    And I explore: how to enable universal implementation
    And I avoid: either blocking good governance or ignoring challenges
    And I provide: honest assessment of feasibility
    And I enable: delegates to set minimums wisely
    And I serve: global justice through technical honesty
