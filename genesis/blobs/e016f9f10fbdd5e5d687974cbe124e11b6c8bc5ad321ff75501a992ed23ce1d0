Scenario: State legislator surfaces constituent priorities across diverse district
    Given the politician represents 200,000 residents across urban and rural areas
    And hears disproportionately from organized lobbying campaigns
    When the Observer aggregates constituent intelligence
    Then they see healthcare affordability is top concern across demographics
    And identify rural transportation barriers affecting economic opportunity
    And learn working families struggle with childcare costs statewide
    And understand constituent priorities beyond lobbying group demands
    And align legislative agenda with actual community needs
