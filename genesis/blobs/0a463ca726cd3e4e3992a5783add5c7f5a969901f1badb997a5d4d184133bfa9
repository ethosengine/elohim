Scenario: Responsible developer gains regional competitive advantage
    Given a responsible developer consistently delivers promised benefits
    And has positive track record across multiple jurisdictions
    When the Observer makes regional reputation visible
    Then the developer shows: projects in four counties all met commitments
    And community feedback is consistently positive
    And environmental standards were exceeded not just met
    And regional reputation creates access to better opportunities
    And integrity pays dividends across jurisdictional boundaries
