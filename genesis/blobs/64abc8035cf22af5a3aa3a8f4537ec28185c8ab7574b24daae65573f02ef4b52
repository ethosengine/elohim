Scenario: Community resilience increases through democratic business network
    Given isolated franchise locations were vulnerable to corporate closure decisions
    And closures destroyed community institutions based on distant profit calculations
    When converted locations join EAE network of mutual support
    Then businesses survive economic downturns through network coordination
    And community institutions are protected from arbitrary corporate closure
    And democratic businesses support each other rather than competing for corporate favor
    And neighborhood economic stability improves through resilient democratic business network
    And community_elohim coordinates network support for community economic resilience
