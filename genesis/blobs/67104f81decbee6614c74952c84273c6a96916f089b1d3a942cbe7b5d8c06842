Scenario: Mandating transparency while protecting privacy
    Given public needs visibility into protocol governance
    And individuals need privacy protection
    When I craft transparency requirements
    Then I require: appeal outcomes and patterns be public
    And I mandate: constitutional council precedents accessible
    And I ensure: individual data privacy through anonymization
    And I specify: security audit results must be disclosed
    And I balance: transparency serving accountability with privacy protection
    And requirements: enable democratic oversight without surveillance
