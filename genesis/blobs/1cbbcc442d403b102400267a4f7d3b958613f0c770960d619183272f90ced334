Scenario: Transitioning from primarily receiving to balanced care economy participation
    Given I am moving from acute crisis toward greater stability
    And my capacity to contribute is increasing
    When I rebuild capability to contribute more to community
    Then the Value Scanner supports my transition to greater contribution
    And celebrates increasing capacity without pressuring premature independence
    And helps me find meaningful ways to contribute as I'm able
    And validates that recovery enables greater community participation
    And tracks my evolving care economy participation over time
    And my personal_agent identifies contribution opportunities matching increasing capacity
    And recognizes that care economy support enabled my rebuilding
    And supports gradual shift toward balanced reciprocity
