Scenario: Mentoring younger community members and professionals
    Given Margaret has decades of nursing experience and life wisdom
    And younger professionals and community members can learn from her
    When Margaret mentors or teaches in community
    Then the community_elohim should recognize mentoring as care work
    And it should value intergenerational knowledge transmission
    And it should connect Margaret with mentoring opportunities
    And her wisdom and experience should benefit next generation
    And mentoring should accumulate care tokens
    And community should benefit from elder mentorship
