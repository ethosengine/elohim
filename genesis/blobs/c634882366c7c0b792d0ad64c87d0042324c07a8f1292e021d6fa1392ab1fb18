Scenario: Family boundaries protect Alex from ableist assumptions
    Given family members might have internalized ableist beliefs
    And some might make assumptions about Alex's quality of life or capabilities
    When family interactions occur
    Then the family_elohim should help Alex maintain boundaries
    And it should support Alex in responding to ableist comments
    And it should document patterns of disrespect or boundary violations
    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves from family ableism
    And the system should recognize that family can be source of harm
    And Alex's right to distance from harmful family dynamics should be supported
    And protection should be available even within family relationships
