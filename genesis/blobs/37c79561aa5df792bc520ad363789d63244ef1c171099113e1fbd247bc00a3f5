Scenario: Explaining attack vectors from authoritarian and corporate actors
    Given global protocol faces threats from powerful adversaries
    And delegates need to understand vulnerabilities
    When I present threat assessment to convention
    Then I explain: how authoritarian regimes might compromise agents
    And I describe: corporate strategies for regulatory capture
    And I assess: resilience of distributed architecture
    And I present: defense mechanisms and their limitations
    And I avoid: either creating panic or false confidence
    And I enable: informed deliberation about governance security
    And I demonstrate: that technical design serves democratic protection
