Scenario: Investor discovers community connection through investment network
    Given stock market investing is isolating
    And Patricia managed portfolio individually without community
    When community investment creates investor network
    Then she knows other neighborhood residents who invested in democratic conversions
    And investors share motivations, coordinate for larger projects, build community wealth strategy
    And investment becomes collective political project, not individual portfolio management
    And community connections deepen through shared values and collaboration
    And community_elohim facilitates investor network development and coordination
