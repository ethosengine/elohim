Scenario: Recognition that parenting skills are professional-grade capabilities
    Given Sarah performs developmental psychology, nutritional science, financial management
    And she coordinates logistics, resolves conflicts, and does long-term strategic planning
    When the system assesses Sarah's capabilities
    Then it should recognize parenting as professional-grade work
    And her skills should be valued as marketable expertise
    And the system should translate parenting skills to professional context
    And Sarah should understand she's performing sophisticated labor
    And her care tokens could translate to professional credit
    And parenting should be recognized as skilled professional work
