Scenario: Participating in industry policy advocacy
    Given policy changes can transform industry conditions
    When legislation affecting food service workers is under consideration
    Then the protocol should alert workers to policy opportunities
    And facilitate participation in legislative advocacy
    And coordinate worker testimony and organizing for policy change
    And build political power for worker-supportive policy
