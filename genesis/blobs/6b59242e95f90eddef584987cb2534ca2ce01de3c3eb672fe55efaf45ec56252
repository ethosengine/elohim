Scenario: Aging in place supported by neighborhood care economy
    Given Helen wants to remain in her home and neighborhood
    And successful aging in place requires community support
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates care resources
    Then it should connect Helen to local support services
    And informal care networks should be strengthened
    And volunteer help should be matched to Helen's needs
    And Helen's accumulated contributions should create claims on support
    And care should flow as reciprocity, not charity
    And the protocol should demonstrate that neighborhoods can support aging in place
    And community care economy should enable elders to remain home
