Scenario: Manager participates in democratic ownership as worker-peer
    Given Marcus's coordinator role doesn't exclude him from worker-ownership
    And his governance weight reflects his facilitation contribution
    When major strategic decisions are made (profit distribution, reinvestment, etc.)
    Then Marcus participates as worker-owner with weighted voice
    And his coordination role is valued but doesn't grant special ownership privilege
    And his tokens accumulate based on witnessed contribution like all workers
    And he benefits from collective success he helps facilitate
    And workplace_elohim prevents coordinator role from becoming ownership concentration
