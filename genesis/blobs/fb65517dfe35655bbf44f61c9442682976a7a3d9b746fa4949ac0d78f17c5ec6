Scenario: Community resource directory tailored to single parent needs
    Given Maria needs to know about available resources but has no time to research
    And single parents have specific resource needs different from partnered families
    When Maria seeks community resources
    Then the community_elohim should provide tailored resource directory
    And it should highlight programs specifically supporting single parents
    And it should filter for her family size, income level, and location
    And resource discovery should be efficient, not an exhausting research project
    And Maria should easily find help available to her without extensive searching
