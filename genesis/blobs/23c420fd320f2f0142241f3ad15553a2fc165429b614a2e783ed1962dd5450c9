Scenario: Owner processes identity shift from sole owner to transition supporter
    Given Rosa's identity was tied to business ownership for 15 years
    And letting go triggers real grief and identity crisis
    When EAE provides transition support including peer counseling
    Then Rosa accesses support groups with other converted owners
    And she processes ownership loss with validation and care
    And new identity emerges: founder who chose community over extraction
    And her purpose shifts from ownership burden to legacy stewardship
    And emotional reality is honored throughout transition
