Scenario: Privacy controls for managing sensitive cross-generational information
    Given Robert manages his parents' sensitive health and financial data
    And he coordinates care with his siblings
    And he supports his adult children while respecting their privacy
    When Robert configures privacy settings
    Then he should have granular control over information flows
    And his parents' health data should be protected
    And his children's information should remain private
    And family care coordination should share only relevant data
    And his workplace should not access family health information
    And community governance should see his care contributions without sensitive details
    And privacy boundaries should protect all parties' dignity
