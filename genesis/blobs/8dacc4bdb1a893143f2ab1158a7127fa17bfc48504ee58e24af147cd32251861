Scenario: Preteen's care work made visible with appropriate recognition
    Given Marcus has completed weekly grocery shopping
    And he has managed budget, nutrition, and meal planning
    When the family_elohim processes Marcus's contributions
    Then his care work should be visible on family dashboard
    And Sarah should receive specific recognition prompts
    And the prompt should detail "Marcus managed $75 budget, maintained 92% nutrition, planned 21 meals"
    And care tokens should reflect genuine economic value of his work
    And recognition should communicate that this is substantial labor
    And Sarah should be prompted to acknowledge his capability
    And Marcus should feel valued as major family contributor
