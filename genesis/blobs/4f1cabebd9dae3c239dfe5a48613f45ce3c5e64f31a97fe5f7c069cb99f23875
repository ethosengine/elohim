Scenario: Household food security supported through care token supplements
    Given household income is $65k/year
    And food costs are rising
    When household's economic status qualifies for support
    Then care token supplements should be available
    And the Value Scanner should remain accessible
    And household should not face food insecurity
    And care economy should function as economic support system
    And access should be dignified, not stigmatizing
