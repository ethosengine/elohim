Scenario: Customer gains optional participation pathway in stakeholder processes
    Given corporate businesses treat customers as transaction data, not community members
    And Ms. Johnson wants deeper engagement but had no pathway
    When democratic governance offers optional customer stakeholder participation
    Then she's invited to stakeholder meetings providing input on community programs
    And her suggestion (senior meal program) is seriously considered and implemented
    And participation is optional—she can remain simple customer or engage more deeply
    And voice is advisory not controlling (workers maintain final decision authority)
    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation while protecting worker autonomy
