Scenario: Operator chooses dignified exit over continued extraction role
    Given James is exhausted from 70-hour weeks and moral injury of implementing exploitation
    And complete exit is valid choice deserving support
    When James decides to exit rather than stay as transition steward
    Then he receives acquisition payment plus six months consulting compensation
    And workers appreciate his choice to enable democratic ownership
    And exit is graceful with community gratitude, not corporate-style termination
    And he leaves with dignity, financial security, and moral peace
    And workplace_elohim facilitates knowledge transfer during dignified exit
