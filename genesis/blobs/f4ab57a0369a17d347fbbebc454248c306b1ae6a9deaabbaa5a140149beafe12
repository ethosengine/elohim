Scenario: Workers adapt operations to serve community cultural needs
    Given neighborhood has significant Latino population
    And community expresses interest in traditional menu items
    When workers receive customer feedback through community_elohim
    Then workers investigate culturally appropriate menu additions
    And workers consult community members on authentic recipes
    And workers democratically vote to expand menu with Latino dishes
    And workers hire bilingual staff to serve community better
    And business becomes more deeply embedded in community culture
