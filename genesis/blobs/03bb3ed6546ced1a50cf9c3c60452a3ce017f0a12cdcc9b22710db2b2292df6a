Scenario: Journalist monitors all neighborhood meetings despite being one person
    Given the journalist covers 8 neighborhood associations
    And can only attend one meeting per week physically
    When the Observer monitors all neighborhood meetings simultaneously
    Then the journalist reviews transcripts of all 8 weekly meetings
    And receives alerts for newsworthy developments
    And identifies stories across all neighborhoods efficiently
    And comprehensive hyperlocal coverage becomes sustainable
    And no important neighborhood decision goes unreported
