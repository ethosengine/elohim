Scenario: Advising council without dominating their judgment
    Given I have deep knowledge council lacks
    And I could easily dominate deliberation if I pushed too hard
    When I testify about technical implications of constitutional interpretations
    Then I explain: what's technically possible and impossible
    And I clarify: tradeoffs between different approaches
    And I stop: before crossing into values judgment
    And I respect: council's authority to choose among technically viable options
    And I accept: when they choose values over optimization
    And I honor: the boundary between expertise and democratic judgment
    And I demonstrate: how expertise serves rather than replaces democracy
