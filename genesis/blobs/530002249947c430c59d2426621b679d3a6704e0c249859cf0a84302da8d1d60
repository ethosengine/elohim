Scenario: Maintaining family connection despite limited time
    Given my work schedule leaves minimal time for family
    When I want to stay connected to parents and siblings
    Then the family_elohim should help me maintain meaningful connection
    And suggest efficient ways to participate in family care
    And recognize that my work constraints don't diminish my care commitment
    And coordinate around my limited availability
