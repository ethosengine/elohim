Scenario: Educational design prevents consumer identity formation
    Given consumer capitalism targets children for conditioning
    And Emma is in critical identity formation years
    When Emma learns through the Value Scanner
    Then no gamification should train extraction thinking
    And no points systems should create consumption addiction
    And no rewards should condition acquisition behavior
    And identity should center on stewardship, not consumption
    And she should learn to see herself as contributor, not consumer
    And care-based identity should be cultivated intentionally
