Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Preteen
  As a preteen (ages 11-13) in the value scanner system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want autonomy to manage real household responsibilities with dignity
  So that my substantial care contributions are recognized and I develop capability under real constraints

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the preteen user "Marcus" is registered in the system
    And Marcus is 12 years old
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Marcus's personal_agent is configured for real responsibility support
    And Marcus manages $75 weekly grocery budget for himself and his sister Keisha
    And parental oversight is calibrated for substantial autonomy

  Scenario: Preteen exercises genuine autonomy in real economic decisions
    Given Marcus has $75 budget for weekly groceries
    And the budget is not hypothetical but actual family resource constraint
    When Marcus uses the Value Scanner to plan weekly shopping
    Then he should have full autonomy within budget boundaries
    And his personal_agent should provide adult-level decision support
    And the interface should treat him as capable, not as a child
    And his choices should have real consequences for family survival
    And the system should recognize he's not practicing but performing
    And autonomy should be genuine, not simulated learning

  Scenario: Managing real scarcity without shame or stigma
    Given Marcus's family has limited economic resources
    And $75/week must feed two people adequately
    When Marcus shops under tight budget constraints
    Then the personal_agent should help him maximize value with dignity
    And budget tools should be presented as capability support, not poverty markers
    And the system should never make him feel ashamed of constraints
    And resourcefulness should be framed as valuable skill, not deprivation
    And his capability to manage scarcity should be recognized as sophisticated
    And no patronizing language about "limited budgets" should be used

  Scenario: Personal agent provides collegial support for complex adult work
    Given Marcus is performing work that adults get paid to do
    And he needs sophisticated planning and analysis tools
    When Marcus's personal_agent interacts with him
    Then the relationship should be almost collegial
    And the agent should provide information, analysis, and planning support
    And the agent should say "You've kept nutrition above 90% for three weeks—excellent stewardship"
    And emotional encouragement should acknowledge real difficulty of his work
    And the agent should serve as genuine tool for real work
    And the tone should respect his capability while supporting his needs

  Scenario: Development of conscious values and identity around care
    Given Marcus is forming conscious values and identity
    And he is developing abstract thinking capacity
    When Marcus makes repeated care decisions over time
    Then he should be developing identity as capable caregiver
    And his values around family responsibility should be consciously forming
    And the system should support healthy identity development
    And he should see himself as person who takes care of his family
    And care economy principles should shape his developing worldview
    And his self-concept should be as contributor, not burden

  Scenario: Planning across time with sophisticated coordination tools
    Given Marcus plans weekly meals for himself and Keisha
    And he must coordinate ingredients across multiple meals
    When Marcus uses planning features
    Then he should have access to meal planning with nutritional analysis
    And budget tracking should project across weeks
    And shopping list optimization should be available
    And inventory management should prevent waste
    And multi-store price comparison should support best value finding
    And planning tools should be professional-grade but accessible

  Scenario: Nutrition management with safety net for critical thresholds
    Given Marcus is responsible for his and Keisha's nutrition
    And inadequate nutrition has serious consequences
    When Marcus makes food choices over time
    Then the personal_agent should track nutrition across meals and weeks
    And the system should watch for nutrition falling below safe levels
    And if nutrition drops below critical thresholds, adult intervention should be triggered
    And Marcus should be supported in meeting nutritional needs
    And the agent should proactively suggest nutritious affordable options
    And safety nets should protect without undermining autonomy

  Scenario: Recognition of substantial care labor as economically valuable
    Given Marcus performs household management work
    And similar work by adults would be compensated
    When Marcus completes weekly shopping and meal planning
    Then his care contributions should be valued at realistic economic rates
    And care tokens should reflect genuine value of his work
    And the system should make explicit that his labor is valuable
    And recognition should communicate that he's doing skilled work
    And his contributions should qualify family for community resources
    And his stewardship should be evidence of capability, not exploitation

  Scenario: Developmentally appropriate autonomy with emergency assistance
    Given Marcus has substantial independence
    And he is still only 12 years old
    When Marcus uses the Value Scanner
    Then he should have freedom to make real decisions
    And emergency assistance options should be clearly visible
    And the personal_agent should watch for stress exceeding healthy bounds
    And crisis situations should trigger connection to adult support
    And intervention should preserve his dignity and autonomy
    And the goal should be supporting capability, not taking over

  Scenario: Privacy protection for sensitive household circumstances
    Given Marcus's household situation must be protected
    And his family's economic constraints are private information
    When Marcus's care contributions are tracked
    Then his specific circumstances must not be broadcast
    And data about shopping patterns must remain confidential
    And community resource coordination should use anonymized data
    And his privacy should be protected even while receiving support
    And no stigmatizing exposure of family situation should occur

  Scenario: Building abstract thinking through real economic complexity
    Given Marcus is developing abstract thinking capacity
    And he's managing genuinely complex resource coordination
    When Marcus plans across time and context
    Then he should be building sophisticated cognitive capabilities
    And the personal_agent should support abstract planning
    And he should understand opportunity costs through real experience
    And complex systems thinking should develop through practice
    And his cognitive development should be supported by real challenges
    And abstract economic concepts should be learned through application

  Scenario: Right to disconnect and data sovereignty maintained
    Given Marcus uses the system for critical household functions
    And constitutional constraints apply at all governance layers
    When Marcus or his family choose to disconnect
    Then the system must honor disconnection immediately
    And alternative methods for household management must remain viable
    And no dependency should be created that makes disconnection harmful
    And data sovereignty must be preserved
    And Marcus's right to not participate must be absolute
