Scenario: Local environmental impact visible through neighborhood patterns
    Given Emma is learning ecological care concepts
    And neighborhood aggregate data shows environmental impact
    When Emma makes choices with environmental dimensions
    Then her personal_agent should share community environmental patterns
    And the agent should say "Your neighborhood has reduced plastic waste by choosing reusable bags"
    And she should see how individual choices aggregate to ecological impact
    And environmental stewardship should be connected to care economy
    And she should learn community can collectively care for local environment
    And ecological literacy should develop at appropriate scale
