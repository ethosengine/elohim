Scenario: Building disability community infrastructure as care economy practice
    Given Alex works to connect disabled people to each other
    And peer networks are essential care economy infrastructure
    When Alex facilitates disability community connections
    Then the community_elohim should recognize network-building as care work
    And peer support groups Alex organizes should count as care contribution
    And accessible events Alex coordinates should accumulate tokens
    And disability culture-building should be valued appropriately
    And Alex's infrastructure work strengthens entire care economy
    And the protocol should see that disability community is care infrastructure
    And Alex's organizing makes mutual aid possible for others
