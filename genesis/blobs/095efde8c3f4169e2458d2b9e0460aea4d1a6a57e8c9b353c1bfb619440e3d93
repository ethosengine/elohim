Scenario: Successfully overturning an agent decision through appeal
    Given I appealed a personal autonomy decision
    And the Constitutional Council has reviewed my case
    When the council rules that the agent overstepped constitutional bounds
    Then the agent's decision is immediately overturned
    And my preferences are updated automatically in the system
    And the incident is documented as an error in the agent's record
    And Similar future interventions require higher thresholds
    And I receive notification of the outcome with full reasoning
    And Protocol improvements are proposed based on my case
