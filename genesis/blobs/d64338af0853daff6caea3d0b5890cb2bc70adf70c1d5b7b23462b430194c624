Scenario: Receiving performance feedback with dignity
    Given Jordan's supervisor conducts annual performance reviews
    And feedback helps employees grow professionally
    When Jordan has their performance review
    Then feedback is delivered respectfully and constructively
    And strengths are celebrated authentically (not patronizingly)
    And growth areas are identified with specific, achievable goals
    And the personal_agent helps Jordan understand and process feedback
    And Jordan's performance is evaluated fairly by actual job standards
    And Jordan experiences professional growth through honest feedback
    And Jordan is treated as a real employee, not a perpetual trainee
