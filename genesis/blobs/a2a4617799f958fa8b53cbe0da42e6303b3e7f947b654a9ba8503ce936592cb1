Feature: Liberation from Franchise Debt and Dual Extraction for Franchise Operator
  As a franchise_operator in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want liberation from corporate extraction and debt burden with dignified exit
  So that I escape financial trap without betraying workers or community

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And James owns three ChickenMax franchises under crushing debt and extraction
    And the individual governance context is active
    And EAE offers conversion enabling escape from franchise trap

  Scenario: Operator achieves debt freedom through fair acquisition
    Given James owes $600K in franchise loans after $1M initial investment
    And corporate extracts 40% of revenue before he sees any profit
    When EAE offers $750K acquisition for three franchise locations
    Then James pays off $600K debt completely
    And receives $150K return on $400K family investment over five years
    And debt burden that dominated his life for years is lifted
    And financial freedom comes without worker exploitation or community betrayal
    And workplace_elohim ensures acquisition pricing is fair to all parties

  Scenario: Operator experiences relief from dual extraction trap
    Given corporate extracts from above (fees, mandatory purchasing, controlled pricing)
    And profitability required worker extraction from below (low wages, speedup, surveillance)
    When EAE conversion eliminates corporate extraction entirely
    Then $100K+ annually per location is freed from franchise fees and markups
    And workers receive substantial wage increases without threatening sustainability
    And James escapes impossible position of implementing exploitation he knows is harmful
    And dual extraction trap that made ethical operation impossible is broken
    And workplace_elohim documents liberation from extraction on both levels

  Scenario: Operator confronts honest accounting of value creation
    Given James believed he "built" the business through risk and management
    And honest accounting reveals distributed value creation
    When conversion process makes contributions visible through REA documentation
    Then James sees workers created operational value through daily labor (Maria's training, Emma's optimization)
    And corporate created systems value but extracted far more than systems were worth
    And his coordination and risk-bearing were real but not sole value creation
    And humbling recognition enables fair distribution replacing mythologized ownership
    And workplace_elohim provides transparent value creation documentation

  Scenario: Operator processes identity shift from franchise owner to liberated participant
    Given James's identity was tied to franchise ownership despite its burden
    And exit could trigger identity crisis and sense of failure
    When EAE provides transition support for psychological and social adjustment
    Then James accesses peer counseling with other converted franchise operators
    And new identity emerges: operator who chose workers and community over corporate servitude
    And he discovers purpose beyond ownership—contribution without extraction
    And transition is honored as wisdom and courage, not failure
    And emotional reality of major life change is validated and supported

  Scenario: Operator chooses dignified exit over continued extraction role
    Given James is exhausted from 70-hour weeks and moral injury of implementing exploitation
    And complete exit is valid choice deserving support
    When James decides to exit rather than stay as transition steward
    Then he receives acquisition payment plus six months consulting compensation
    And workers appreciate his choice to enable democratic ownership
    And exit is graceful with community gratitude, not corporate-style termination
    And he leaves with dignity, financial security, and moral peace
    And workplace_elohim facilitates knowledge transfer during dignified exit

  Scenario: Operator experiences moral liberation from implementing harmful policies
    Given franchise agreement required implementing corporate policies James knew harmed workers
    And moral injury from enforcing extraction while knowing it's wrong caused deep stress
    When conversion frees him from corporate mandates
    Then James no longer implements surveillance monitoring workers like criminals
    And he stops enforcing poverty wages and impossible productivity demands
    And stress from moral contradiction (knowing exploitation is wrong but implementing it) dissipates
    And his health improves measurably (lower blood pressure, better sleep, reduced anxiety)
    And workplace_elohim documents health benefits of liberation from moral injury

  Scenario: Operator's family investment is honored and fairly compensated
    Given James's family invested $400K supporting his franchise dream
    And they took real risk and deserve fair treatment
    When acquisition provides $150K return after debt repayment
    Then family receives back substantial portion of investment
    And return reflects their risk and support over five years
    And family can choose to reinvest in community investment pool if desired
    And family investors appreciate dignified resolution protecting workers and James
    And workplace_elohim ensures family investor treatment is transparent and fair

  Scenario: Operator gains autonomy through liberation from franchise agreement constraints
    Given franchise agreement prohibited innovation, local adaptation, and independent decisions
    And James bore all risk while having no autonomy
    When franchise termination succeeds and corporate control ends
    Then (if staying as steward) James finally exercises local knowledge corporate ignored
    And business responds to community needs rather than distant corporate mandates
    And workers implement innovations he suggested but corporate prohibited
    And autonomy is experienced after years of constrained servitude to franchise rules
    And workplace_elohim documents operational improvements from liberation

  Scenario: Operator exits 70-hour work weeks for sustainable life balance
    Given franchise operation demanded constant presence and crushing time commitment
    And James sacrificed family time, health, and personal life to business survival
    When conversion enables his exit or transition to reasonable steward role
    Then 70-hour weeks end, replaced by balanced schedule if staying or complete exit
    And family relationships can heal after years of absence and stress
    And personal health improves through reduced stress and reasonable hours
    And life beyond business becomes possible for first time in years
    And workplace_elohim ensures transition protects his wellbeing

  Scenario: Operator discovers solidarity with workers through shared recognition of exploitation
    Given James and workers both resented each other due to structural positions
    And conversion reveals corporate extracted from both operator and workers
    When honest accounting shows parallel victimization
    Then unexpected solidarity emerges from recognizing common enemy (corporate)
    And workers learn James netted modest income after corporate extraction and debt service
    And James learns workers created value he attributed to his management
    And mutual antagonism transforms to mutual respect through honest accounting
    And workplace_elohim facilitates shared recognition of dual exploitation

  Scenario: Operator's local relationships become valuable instead of corporate brand dominance
    Given franchise model made operator invisible behind corporate brand
    And James's community relationships were obscured by ChickenMax identity
    When conversion makes his choice visible to community
    Then neighbors learn James chose democratic ownership over continuing corporate extraction
    And local relationships previously invisible become valued and recognized
    And community respects his decision to prioritize workers and neighborhood
    And identity shifts from anonymous franchise operator to community member who chose well
    And workplace_elohim helps communicate transition story to community

  Scenario: Operator achieves financial security without requiring worker exploitation
    Given franchise profitability required suppressing wages and pushing workers harder
    And James hated exploiting workers but saw no alternative within franchise structure
    When conversion provides acquisition payment liberating him financially
    Then $150K return plus consulting income provides foundation for next chapter
    And financial security came through fair value recognition, not worker exploitation
    And false choice between operator security and worker dignity is resolved
    And ethical path to personal financial stability becomes real
    And workplace_elohim documents that exploitation is not necessary for operator security
