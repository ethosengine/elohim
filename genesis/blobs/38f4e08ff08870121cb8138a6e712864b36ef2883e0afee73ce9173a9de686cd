Scenario: Teen learns healthy work-life boundaries
    Given Jasmine's employer frequently requests last-minute schedule changes
    And this disrupts her school and family commitments
    When workplace_elohim tracks scheduling patterns
    Then it should recognize the boundary violation
    And help her understand that she has right to reasonable scheduling
    And support her in negotiating better scheduling practices
    And teach her that workers can and should set boundaries
    And build her expectation that work should respect whole life
    And prepare her for adult advocacy for work-life balance
