Scenario: Community care tokens accumulate from sustained volunteer participation
    Given Frank has volunteered consistently over years
    And his contributions are substantial and ongoing
    When the community_elohim calculates care tokens
    Then tokens should accumulate from Frank's volunteer hours
    And skill level should affect token value (skilled trades valued highly)
    And sustained participation should be recognized over time
    And accumulated tokens should represent Frank's community standing
    And tokens should create claims on community resources and support
    And his years of contribution should be visible and valued
