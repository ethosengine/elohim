Scenario: Balancing workplace contribution with personal capacity
    Given Aisha has limited energy and time
    And workplace demands compete with personal needs
    When Aisha allocates her care capacity
    Then the personal_agent should help her balance commitments
    And it should recognize that workplace care is one of multiple obligations
    And it should flag when work encroaches on essential personal care
    And the system should support sustainable allocation of capacity
    And she should learn that professional success requires personal foundation
    And work-life balance should be actively maintained
