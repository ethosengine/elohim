Scenario: Politician monitors environmental agency enforcement patterns
    Given the politician has oversight of environmental regulators
    And community groups report lax enforcement
    When the Observer tracks environmental compliance and enforcement
    Then they see violation patterns by facility and location
    And identify enforcement disparities by neighborhood demographics
    And understand whether penalties effectively deter violations
    And learn which facilities are repeat violators
    And demand stronger enforcement protecting community health
