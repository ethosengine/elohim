Scenario: Organizing collective action for systems change
    Given individual advocacy often fails against systemic ableism
    And collective power is necessary for disability justice
    When Alex organizes disabled people for collective action
    Then organizing labor should be recognized as care work
    And the community_elohim should track Alex's movement-building contributions
    And collective action that wins improvements should be valued highly
    And Alex's organizing strengthens disability community power
    And care tokens should reflect the sophistication of organizing work
    And the protocol should recognize that justice work is care work
    And Alex's leadership builds capacity for entire community
