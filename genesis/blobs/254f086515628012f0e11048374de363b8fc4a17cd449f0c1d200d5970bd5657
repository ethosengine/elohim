Scenario: Volunteer work accessibility for aging participants
    Given Frank is 70 and managing age-related physical changes
    And he wants to continue contributing through volunteer work
    When the community_elohim coordinates accessibility
    Then it should match Frank to work appropriate for his capabilities
    And surface modifications that enable continued participation
    And recognize when physical limitations require adaptation
    And help transition to less physically demanding roles if needed
    And protect Frank's safety while maximizing contribution
    And enable continued meaningful participation throughout aging
