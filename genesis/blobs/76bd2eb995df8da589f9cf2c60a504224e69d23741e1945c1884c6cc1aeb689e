Scenario: National research infrastructure enabling cumulative knowledge
    Given sustainable research requires ongoing data access and funding
    And I advocate for long-term research infrastructure
    When national research program is established with public funding
    Then independent researchers gain: anonymized data access with privacy protection
    And longitudinal tracking becomes: possible across decades
    And replication and extension: of findings is enabled
    And peer review and quality control: maintain scientific standards
    And research independence from: protocol developers is preserved
    And Knowledge accumulates: rather than being rediscovered each generation
    And Democratic AI governance becomes: evidence-based rather than ideological
