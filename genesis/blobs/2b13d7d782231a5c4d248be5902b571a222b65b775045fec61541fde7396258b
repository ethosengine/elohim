Scenario: Household governance as necessary autocracy with age-appropriate child input
    Given Maria is the only adult making every household decision
    And children need appropriate voice based on developmental stage
    When household decisions are made
    Then the household_elohim should support Maria's final authority
    And it should help her gather age-appropriate input from children
    And her 14-year-old should have more voice than younger children
    And her 6-year-old should have simple choices within boundaries
    And household governance should be efficient while respecting all members
    And Maria should maintain control without becoming authoritarian
