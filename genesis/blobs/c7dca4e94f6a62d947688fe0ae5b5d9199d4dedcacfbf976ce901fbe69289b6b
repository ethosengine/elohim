Scenario: Neighborhood emergency response utilizes retired residents' availability
    Given Frank has daytime availability when many neighbors work
    And neighborhoods need emergency response capacity
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates emergency preparedness
    Then it should include Frank in neighborhood emergency plans
    And utilize his construction skills for emergency assessment
    And coordinate check-ins on vulnerable neighbors during crises
    And recognize retired residents as neighborhood resilience resources
    And Frank should feel valuable in emergency response role
    And his availability should serve collective security
    And neighborhood should benefit from his time flexibility
