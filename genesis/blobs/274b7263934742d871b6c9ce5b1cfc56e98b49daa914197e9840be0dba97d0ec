Scenario: Drafting Community AI Infrastructure Act for national funding
    Given poor communities nationwide need infrastructure support
    And I want equitable protocol access
    When I draft national funding legislation
    Then I provide: grants for community nodes and maintenance
    And I fund: research evaluating protocol outcomes
    And I support: technical assistance for poor communities
    And I establish: sliding scale and cross-subsidization
    And I treat: democratic AI governance as public infrastructure
    And I defend: against claims of "picking winners"
    And I argue: this enables democracy not market manipulation
