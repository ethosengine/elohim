Scenario: Parent opposes standardized testing overload
    Given the parent's child faces excessive standardized testing
    And tests create stress without improving learning
    When the parent reviews Observer's testing policy context
    Then they see how many instructional days lost to testing
    And understand which tests are federally required vs optional
    And learn about opt-out policies and parent rights
    And discover other parents concerned about testing burden
    And parent coalition advocates for reducing unnecessary testing
