Scenario: Sustainable protein choices within budget
    Given protein production has varied environmental impact
    And Aisha wants to make sustainable choices
    When Aisha selects protein sources
    Then the bioregional_elohim should show environmental impact differences
    And it should highlight lower-impact protein options
    And it should help her access affordable sustainable proteins
    And plant-based options should be presented when cheaper
    And environmental impact should inform protein decisions
    And sustainable nutrition should be achievable on her budget
