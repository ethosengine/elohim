Scenario: Individual grief processing supported amid ongoing loss
    Given James experiences anticipatory grief constantly
    And he's losing David slowly while providing daily care
    When the personal_agent recognizes James's grief
    Then it should connect him to grief support resources
    And it should acknowledge the unique pain of progressive loss
    And it should support his emotional processing
    And grief should be recognized as ongoing burden, not one-time event
    And the protocol should hold space for James's devastating loss
