Scenario: Coordinating family participation in children's lives during instability
    Given my children's lives are disrupted by housing changes and crisis
    And extended family wants to support children's stability
    When I organize family involvement in children's education, activities, care
    Then the family_elohim coordinates family practical support
    And helps family members contribute according to their capacity
    And maintains my oversight of all family involvement with children
    And ensures family help is consistent with my parenting values
    And tracks family contributions with care token recognition
    And my personal_agent facilitates communication without overwhelming me
    And recognizes coordination of family help as substantial organizational labor
    And validates that family participation strengthens children's support network
