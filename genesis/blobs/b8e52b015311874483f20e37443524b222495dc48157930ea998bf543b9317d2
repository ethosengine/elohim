Scenario: Transitioning from child to adult in family system
    Given Jordan turned 26 and family dynamics are shifting
    And parents are learning to see Jordan as an adult
    When family interactions reveal old patterns (treating Jordan as child)
    Then the family_elohim surfaces the pattern respectfully
    And the system provides education about adult autonomy for IDD people
    And Jordan can express feelings about wanting adult treatment
    And the family receives support for the transition
    And Jordan's growth toward greater autonomy is celebrated
    And the family system evolves to honor Jordan's adult status
