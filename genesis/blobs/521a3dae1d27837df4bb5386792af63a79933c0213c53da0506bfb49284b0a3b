Scenario: Traditional weather knowledge and climate adaptation
    Given Margaret has observed local weather patterns for decades
    And traditional weather knowledge supports climate adaptation
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks traditional climate knowledge
    Then it should recognize Margaret's weather wisdom
    And it should value traditional ecological forecasting
    And it should document climate observation across decades
    And Margaret's knowledge should inform community climate adaptation
    And traditional knowledge should complement scientific understanding
    And elder wisdom should support bioregional resilience
