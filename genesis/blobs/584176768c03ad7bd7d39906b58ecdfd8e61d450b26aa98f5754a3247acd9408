Scenario: Manager's proposals can be rejected without retaliation
    Given Marcus proposes operational change he believes is beneficial
    And workers deliberate and vote to reject the proposal
    When rejection occurs
    Then Marcus accepts worker decision gracefully
    And Marcus does not retaliate through subtle means
    And Marcus proposes alternative approaches respecting worker concerns
    And workers know their democratic power is real, not performative
    And workplace_elohim ensures rejected proposals don't resurface as subtle coercion
