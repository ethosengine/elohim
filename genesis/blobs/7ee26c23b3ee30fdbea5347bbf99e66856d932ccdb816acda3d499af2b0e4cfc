Scenario: Neighborhood care tokens recognize local contributions
    Given Robert contributes to neighborhood care economy
    And his contributions strengthen neighborhood for everyone
    When neighborhood_elohim tracks care tokens
    Then it should recognize his neighborhood care contributions
    And value his help for elderly neighbors, resource sharing, and leadership
    And accumulate tokens that reflect his neighborhood care work
    And connect tokens to neighborhood governance voice
    And demonstrate that care contributions create social capital
    And recognize that neighborhood care is genuine economic contribution
    And build neighborhood through reciprocal care recognition
