Scenario: Advising on national constitutional amendment technical implications
    Given adolescent autonomy amendment is proposed
    And technical implementation is uncertain
    When I explain implementation possibilities to National Council
    Then I clarify: how agents would operationalize new constitutional principle
    And I assess: technical challenges in implementation
    And I identify: what research or development would be needed
    And I avoid: either blocking amendment due to difficulty or ignoring challenges
    And I enable: informed democratic choice about constitutional evolution
    And I serve: constitutional amendment process with technical honesty
