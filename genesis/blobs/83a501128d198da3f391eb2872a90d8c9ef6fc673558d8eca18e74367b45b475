Scenario: Observing Constitutional Council deliberation in real-time
    Given Community Constitutional Council is reviewing Marcus's mental health appeal
    And I have permission to observe their deliberation
    When I document how the council works through the case
    Then I capture: argument patterns, member interactions, uncertainty navigation
    And I analyze: how expertise influences judgment, how dissent gets resolved
    And I examine: quality of deliberation, constitutional reasoning depth
    And I observe: what enables effective citizen governance
    And I document: dynamics that retrospective analysis would miss
    And My research reveals how sortition democracy actually works
    And Findings feed back to improve council support and training
