Feature: Family Layer Multigenerational Care Coordination for Elderly
  As an elderly person in the value scanner system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to maintain my role as valued family member while receiving care
  So that I experience reciprocal care relationships across generations

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elderly user "Helen" is registered in the system
    And Helen is part of a multigenerational family
    And Helen's daughter Sarah provides primary family care
    And Helen has grandchildren and great-grandchildren
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy

  Scenario: Family care labor made visible to prevent invisible burden
    Given Helen's daughter Sarah provides substantial weekly care
    And Sarah also works and has her own children
    When Sarah assists Helen with shopping, appointments, and household tasks
    Then the family_elohim should make this care work visible
    And Sarah's care labor should be recognized with care tokens
    And the family should see Sarah's contribution quantified
    And Sarah should not feel guilty about needing recognition
    And Helen should understand the care Sarah provides
    And the protocol should prevent invisible exploitation of family caregivers
    And care work should be valued, not taken for granted

  Scenario: Elderly person's continued contributions made visible to family
    Given Helen shares family stories with great-grandchildren
    And she provides wisdom from 82 years of experience
    When Helen contributes to family flourishing
    Then her contributions should be visible in care economy tracking
    And family should see that Helen still gives, not just receives
    And care tokens should reflect her mentoring and wisdom sharing
    And reciprocity should be visible even when care flows are asymmetric
    And Helen should experience herself as valued contributor, not burden
    And younger generations should learn that elders have worth
    And the protocol should make visible what market economics erases

  Scenario: Family decision-making includes elderly voice appropriately
    Given family decisions affect Helen's care and wellbeing
    And Helen retains decision-making capacity
    When family governance processes occur
    Then Helen's voice should carry weight in family decisions
    And she should not be decided about, but consulted
    And the family_elohim should ensure her input is heard
    And family should not override her preferences without consent
    And she should experience agency within family governance
    And the protocol should preserve her standing as family elder
    And respect should be maintained even as care needs increase

  Scenario: Family care coordination prevents caregiver burnout
    Given Sarah provides most of Helen's family care
    And unsustainable care burden causes burnout
    When the family_elohim analyzes care patterns
    Then it should identify when Sarah's burden is too heavy
    And it should suggest care distribution across family members
    And it should surface when professional support is needed
    And it should intervene before crisis occurs
    And Sarah should not have to advocate for her own limits
    And the system should protect both Helen and Sarah
    And sustainable multigenerational care should be built proactively

  Scenario: Grandparent-grandchild relationships maintained despite limitations
    Given Helen's mobility and cognitive limitations affect interaction
    And grandchildren want relationship with Helen
    When grandparent-grandchild connection is facilitated
    Then the family_elohim should coordinate visits that don't overwhelm Helen
    And communication should be adapted to her capabilities
    And grandchildren should be guided on how to interact respectfully
    And Helen's contributions to grandchildren should be recognized
    And relationships should be preserved despite changing capabilities
    And the protocol should support connection across limitations
    And grandchildren should learn to value elders through maintained relationship

  Scenario: Family care economy includes elderly in reciprocal network
    Given the family participates in care token economy
    And Helen both receives and gives care
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Helen's contributions should be valued alongside her care receipt
    And her lifetime of family care should be visible
    And current care she receives should be framed as reciprocity
    And family care economy should show mutual support, not one-way dependency
    And Helen should have standing in family based on accumulated contributions
    And the protocol should demonstrate that care flows throughout entire lifespan
    And family economics should value elders as continuing participants

  Scenario: Adult children caring for aging parents receive support
    Given Sarah navigates complex dynamics of caring for her mother
    And role reversal creates emotional challenges
    When Sarah provides care for Helen
    Then the family_elohim should provide guidance on healthy boundaries
    And Sarah should receive recognition for care labor
    And emotional complexity should be acknowledged
    And Sarah should be connected to caregiver support resources
    And Helen's dignity should be preserved through care relationship changes
    And the protocol should support both caregiver and care recipient
    And family care should be sustainable and healthy for all

  Scenario: Family memory preservation through elderly storytelling
    Given Helen holds decades of family history
    And dementia threatens loss of collective memory
    When Helen shares family stories
    Then the family_elohim should help capture and preserve these memories
    And Helen's storytelling should be recognized as valuable contribution
    And great-grandchildren should learn family history from Helen
    And her role as family memory keeper should be honored
    And preservation should happen while she can still share
    And the protocol should recognize cultural value of elder wisdom
    And family heritage should be maintained through elder participation

  Scenario: Family cultural values shape elderly care approach
    Given Helen's family has specific cultural values about elder care
    And different cultures have different expectations
    When family care is coordinated
    Then the family_elohim should respect cultural context
    And care approaches should align with family cultural values
    And Helen should receive care consistent with her cultural expectations
    And family obligations should be understood culturally
    And the protocol should serve diverse family structures and values
    And no single model of "good elder care" should be imposed
    And cultural wisdom about aging should be honored

  Scenario: Multigenerational household coordination when elderly live with family
    Given some families have Helen living with adult children
    And multigenerational households have complex dynamics
    When household governance includes elderly family member
    Then the family_elohim should mediate competing needs
    And Helen's needs should be balanced with other household members
    And her voice should be heard in household decisions
    And privacy should be maintained for all generations
    And care should be coordinated without overwhelming household
    And the protocol should support healthy multigenerational living
    And all family members' flourishing should be considered

  Scenario: End-of-life planning as family governance issue
    Given Helen is facing mortality consciously
    And her death will affect entire family
    When family discusses Helen's end-of-life wishes
    Then the family_elohim should facilitate dignity-preserving conversations
    And Helen's wishes should be documented and shared with family
    And family should understand and commit to honoring her preferences
    And emotional complexity should be supported
    And Helen's voice should be authoritative about her own death
    And family should be prepared to advocate for her wishes
    And the protocol should support family through end-of-life planning

  Scenario: Great-grandchildren learn care economy through elder relationship
    Given Helen's great-grandchildren are young children
    And they observe family caring for Helen
    When great-grandchildren interact with Helen
    Then they should learn that elders deserve care and respect
    And they should see care flowing reciprocally across generations
    And they should experience Helen as person, not problem
    And they should learn that humans need more care as we age
    And they should internalize that caregiving is valuable
    And the protocol should teach care economy through family relationships
    And next generation should grow up assuming care reciprocity is normal
