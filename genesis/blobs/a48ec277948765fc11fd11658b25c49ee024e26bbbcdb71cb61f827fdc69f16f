Scenario: Environmental stewardship practices improve through community accountability
    Given individual ownership limited environmental investment
    And community bears environmental impacts of business operations
    When democratic governance with community input prioritizes sustainability
    Then auto shop invests in proper waste disposal and recycling
    And hazardous materials (oil, antifreeze, batteries) are handled responsibly
    And workers implement environmental improvements community values
    And transparency about environmental practices builds community trust
    And community_elohim documents environmental stewardship for neighborhood benefit
