Scenario: Politician tracks accountability for climate action commitments
    Given the politician pledged to reduce municipal carbon emissions
    And committed to specific climate resilience investments
    When the Observer monitors climate commitment implementation
    Then they see actual emissions trends versus reduction targets
    And identify which climate initiatives launched versus stalled
    And understand budget allocation for climate versus other priorities
    And receive alerts when commitments fall behind schedule
    And maintain accountability for climate action promises
