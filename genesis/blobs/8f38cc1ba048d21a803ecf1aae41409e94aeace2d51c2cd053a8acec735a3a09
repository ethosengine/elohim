Scenario: Cross-municipal coordination with neighboring cities
    Given some challenges extend beyond Riverside boundaries
    And watershed management affects multiple municipalities
    When I coordinate with neighboring community leaders
    Then we convene: inter-municipal deliberative assemblies
    And agents from: different municipalities share analysis
    And we negotiate: agreements serving all communities
    And we respect: each municipality's sovereignty
    And we find: synthesis through democratic deliberation
    And lateral coordination: addresses problems that don't respect boundaries
    And we demonstrate: governance working across jurisdictions
