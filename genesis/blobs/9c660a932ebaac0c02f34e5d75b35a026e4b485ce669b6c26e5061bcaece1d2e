Scenario: Navigating neighborhood with wayfinding support
    Given Jordan is learning the neighborhood geography
    And some streets and locations still confuse Jordan
    When Jordan wants to visit a neighbor or shop
    Then the personal_agent provides visual wayfinding assistance
    And the interface shows landmarks and turn-by-turn pictures
    And Jordan's navigation skills improve with accessible support
    And Jordan gains increasing independence in the neighborhood
    And support workers can reduce assistance as Jordan's capability grows
    And Jordan experiences growing autonomy and confidence
