Scenario: Neighborhood childcare coordination supports working parents
    Given Sarah works full-time as a teacher
    And childcare is expensive and inflexible
    When neighborhood coordinates childcare sharing
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should match schedules and needs
    And it should track reciprocal childcare exchanges
    And it should help parents like Sarah support each other
    And childcare costs should be reduced through cooperation
    And quality care should be accessible to working families
