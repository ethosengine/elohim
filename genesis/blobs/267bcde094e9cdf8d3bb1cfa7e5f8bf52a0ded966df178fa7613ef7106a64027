    Given municipality purchases vehicles and services from private vendors
    And public procurement can support democratic economy development
    When Rosa's Auto bids for city fleet maintenance contracts
    Then municipal procurement gives preference to worker-owned businesses
    And democratic enterprises compete successfully for public contracts
    And taxpayer money supports living wages and community wealth, not corporate extraction
    And procurement policy changes demonstrate municipal commitment to economic democracy
    And municipality_elohim tracks procurement impacts on democratic business viability
