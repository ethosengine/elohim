Scenario: Participate in 7-year Constitutional Convention
    Given the First Global Constitutional Convention convenes
    And 10,000 randomly-selected citizens are delegates
    And Marcus is not selected but his case is referenced
    When delegates deliberate on privacy and mental health amendment
    Then Marcus's appeal precedent is studied by delegates
    And Marcus's experience of violation-despite-care informs understanding
    And researchers present data on appeals like Marcus's
    And delegates hear from appellants worldwide
    And amendment proposal incorporates lessons from appeals
    And constitutional evolution is grounded in lived experience
