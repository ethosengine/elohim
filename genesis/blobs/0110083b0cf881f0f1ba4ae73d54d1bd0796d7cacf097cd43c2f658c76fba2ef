Scenario: Transition and turnover management in student households
    Given student housing is temporary and roommates change
    And Kenji might have different roommates each year
    When roommates transition in and out of household
    Then the household_elohim should document established patterns
    And it should help new roommates integrate into household norms
    And it should preserve institutional knowledge across transitions
    And it should help negotiate new arrangements with new people
    And the system should reduce friction from household turnover
    And care economy patterns should transfer across roommate changes
