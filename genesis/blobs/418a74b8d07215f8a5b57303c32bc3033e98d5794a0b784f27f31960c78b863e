Scenario: Activist exposes wage theft and labor violations
    Given workers report widespread wage theft
    And enforcement seems inadequate
    When the Observer tracks labor violations and enforcement
    Then the activist documents thousands of violations annually
    And shows penalties are minimal and rarely collected
    And identifies which employers are repeat offenders
    And exposes regulatory capture of labor enforcement
    And worker protection becomes political accountability issue
