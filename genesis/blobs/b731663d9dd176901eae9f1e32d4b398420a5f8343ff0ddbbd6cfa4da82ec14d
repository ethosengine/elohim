Feature: Individual Liberation and Purpose for Manager
  As a manager in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want liberation from extraction role and meaningful purpose
  So that I serve rather than dominate, coordinate rather than control

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Marcus has transitioned from corporate manager to democratic coordinator
    And the individual governance context is active
    And his role has fundamentally transformed from command to facilitation

  Scenario: Manager receives liberation from moral injury of implementing exploitation
    Given Marcus previously enforced corporate extraction policies
    And he experienced stress from implementing exploitation he knew was harmful
    When ChickenMax converts to EAE democratic ownership
    Then Marcus is offered choice to transition or exit with dignified severance
    And if he chooses to stay, his role shifts from enforcing extraction to facilitating coordination
    And he no longer implements policies harming workers he knows
    And his stress levels decrease measurably (lower cortisol, better sleep)
    And workplace_elohim documents his transition from extraction to service

  Scenario: Manager's expertise is valued without requiring worker subordination
    Given Marcus has genuine operational expertise from years of experience
    And corporate role required worker subordination to exercise that expertise
    When Marcus transitions to democratic coordinator
    Then his scheduling knowledge becomes proposals, not commands
    And his operations expertise is valued through consultation, not authority
    And workers request his input because it's helpful, not because it's mandated
    And his compensation ($72K) reflects expertise without extraction premium
    And his purpose comes from service, not domination

  Scenario: Manager derives legitimacy from consent rather than hierarchical appointment
    Given Marcus was previously appointed by corporate, not chosen by workers
    And workers resented his authority as imposed
    When democratic governance structures are established
    Then Marcus's coordinator role requires ongoing worker consent
    And workers evaluate his facilitation effectiveness quarterly
    And workers can democratically recall him if he fails to serve collective interests
    And his legitimacy is earned through effective service, not imposed through hierarchy
    And workplace_elohim ensures fair evaluation process

  Scenario: Manager unlearns corporate extraction training through supported transition
    Given Marcus was trained by corporate to minimize labor costs and maximize productivity
    And these extraction skills are actively harmful in democratic context
    When he begins democratic coordinator role
    Then he receives training in facilitation, mediation, and collaborative coordination
    And workplace_elohim provides resources on horizontal organization practices
    And other democratic coordinators mentor him through transition
    And he unlearns surveillance instincts and command reflexes
    And his skill evolution is documented and supported, not demanded instantly

  Scenario: Manager experiences reduced antagonism through structural transformation
    Given Marcus lived in constant tension between workers and corporate
    And workers saw him as enemy implementing exploitation
    When structure changes from extraction to democratic coordination
    Then worker antagonism dissipates as he stops enforcing extraction
    And conflicts become collaborative problem-solving, not power struggles
    And DeShawn's questions become genuine inquiry, not veiled resistance
    And Marcus experiences relief from structural antagonism
    And his relationships with workers transform from adversarial to collaborative

  Scenario: Manager's personal growth shifts from extraction efficiency to facilitation effectiveness
    Given corporate measured Marcus's success by labor cost minimization
    And his career growth meant managing more extraction at larger scale
    When he transitions to democratic coordinator
    Then his growth trajectory shifts to facilitation skill development
    And he learns consensus-building, conflict mediation, transparent communication
    And his expertise becomes transferable to human flourishing, not just profit extraction
    And he can mentor new EAE acquisitions through democratic transition
    And his skills serve life instead of serving only capital

  Scenario: Manager accesses fair compensation without guilt of extraction
    Given Marcus earned $65K as corporate manager implementing exploitation
    And he knew he was paid partly for willingness to harm workers
    When he becomes democratic coordinator earning $72K
    Then his compensation reflects genuine coordination expertise
    And workers democratically approved his salary as fair
    And he earns more than under corporate while feeling morally justified
    And he no longer carries guilt of being paid to extract from colleagues
    And workplace_elohim ensures compensation transparency prevents exploitation

  Scenario: Manager chooses to exit gracefully with dignity and support
    Given Marcus decides democratic coordination isn't the right fit for him
    And corporate would have fired him or demanded resignation
    When he communicates his intention to exit
    Then workers appreciate his honest self-assessment
    And he receives six months severance with glowing reference
    And workplace_elohim facilitates transition support and knowledge transfer
    And he leaves with dignity and community gratitude for attempting transition
    And exit support demonstrates democratic values in practice
