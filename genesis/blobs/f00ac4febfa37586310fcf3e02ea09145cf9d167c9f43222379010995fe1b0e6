Scenario: Investor consumption and investment align supporting same democratic businesses
    Given Patricia's consumption and investment were previously disconnected activities
    And roles as customer and investor didn't integrate
    When she invests in and patronizes same democratic businesses
    Then consumption supports investment supports values supports community
    And economic activities align creating virtuous cycle
    And integrated participation deepens commitment and impact
    And community economic participation becomes holistic, not fragmented
    And community_elohim helps investors see connections between consumption and investment
