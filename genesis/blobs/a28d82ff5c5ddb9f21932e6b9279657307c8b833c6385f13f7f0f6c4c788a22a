Scenario: Building neural pathways for care-based economic thinking
    Given Emma's brain is highly plastic during ages 8-10
    And repeated patterns shape lifelong thinking
    When Emma makes value decisions consistently
    Then she should internalize that resources are for stewardship
    And she should learn that choices affect others' flourishing
    And she should understand that care creates value
    And neural pathways around care economy thinking should form
    And these patterns should serve her entire life
    And she should develop alternative to extraction-based economics
