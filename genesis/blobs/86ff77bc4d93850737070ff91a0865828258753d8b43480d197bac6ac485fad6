Scenario: Family care coordination prevents caregiver burnout
    Given Sarah provides most of Helen's family care
    And unsustainable care burden causes burnout
    When the family_elohim analyzes care patterns
    Then it should identify when Sarah's burden is too heavy
    And it should suggest care distribution across family members
    And it should surface when professional support is needed
    And it should intervene before crisis occurs
    And Sarah should not have to advocate for her own limits
    And the system should protect both Helen and Sarah
    And sustainable multigenerational care should be built proactively
