Scenario: Managing privacy and information sharing on my terms
    Given I have sensitive information about my situation
    And multiple institutions are requesting access to my data
    When I decide what to share and with whom
    Then the Value Scanner gives me granular control over all data sharing
    And defaults to maximum privacy protection
    And clearly explains consequences of sharing vs. not sharing
    And never shares information without my explicit consent
    And helps me understand my rights regarding privacy
    And protects me from institutional coercion to over-share
    And my personal_agent alerts me to privacy risks
    And my safety-critical information remains absolutely protected
