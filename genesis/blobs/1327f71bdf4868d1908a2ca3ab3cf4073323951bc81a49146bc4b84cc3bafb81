Scenario: Parent discovers coalition for youth recreation programs
    Given municipal budget cuts threaten youth sports and rec programs
    And the parent's child participates in city soccer league
    When the Observer detects 180 parents whose children use these programs
    Then parents form rapid coalition to defend youth programs
    And present coordinated data on program participation and benefits
    And show economic value of city programs vs private alternatives
    And municipal budget priorities respond to organized parent power
    And youth recreation programs are preserved
