Scenario: Student community as political and cultural force
    Given students are networked, idealistic, and trend-setting
    And student movements have historically created cultural change
    When student community adopts care economy practices
    Then the community_elohim should recognize students as change agents
    And it should support spread of care economy culture among students
    And it should help students see themselves as building alternative economy
    And student community should be recognized as site for cultural transformation
    And the system should empower students as care economy pioneers
    And student adoption could spread care economy to broader generation
