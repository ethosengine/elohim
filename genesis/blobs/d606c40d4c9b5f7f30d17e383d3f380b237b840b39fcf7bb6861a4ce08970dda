Scenario: Supporting children's social and emotional development through school connections
    Given children need peer relationships and social development
    And school provides important social context during crisis
    When I support children's social development through education
    Then the Value Scanner helps me facilitate children's school friendships
    And coordinates children's participation in social activities (clubs, sports, events)
    And accesses resources for children's social activities despite cost barriers
    And tracks children's social development and peer relationships
    And validates that social development is as important as academics
    And my personal_agent reminds me of school social events children care about
    And recognizes social development facilitation as care work
    And celebrates children's friendships and belonging
