Scenario: Community celebrates farm as democratic institution and food security asset
    Given agricultural institutions are typically invisible or taken for granted
    And democratic farm conversion represents major community achievement
    When farm reaches milestones in democratic governance and community service
    Then community celebrates with public events honoring farmworkers and transformation
    And farm story becomes source of community pride and inspiration
    And successful democratic farm model encourages other agricultural conversions
    And community recognizes farm as essential democratic institution
    And community_elohim coordinates celebration events and community farm storytelling
