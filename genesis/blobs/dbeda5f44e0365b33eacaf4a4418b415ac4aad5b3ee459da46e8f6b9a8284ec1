Scenario: Recognizing my own labor as care contribution
    Given I work 50+ hours per week as a line cook
    And I prepare food for hundreds of people daily
    When I view my work through the care economy lens
    Then the protocol should recognize my labor as care work
    And accumulate care tokens reflecting my contribution to community nourishment
    And show me that my work has dignity and social value
    And reframe my relationship to labor from pure exploitation to meaningful contribution
