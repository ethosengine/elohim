Scenario: Franchise menu constraints are lifted enabling local adaptation
    Given corporate mandated standardized menu prohibiting innovation
    And community requested options (vegan, healthier choices) were impossible to offer
    When menu control transfers to democratic worker governance
    Then workers add menu items responding to neighborhood preferences
    And seasonal offerings use Johnson Farm's available produce
    And cultural preferences of diverse community are reflected in menu
    And innovation serves local needs rather than distant corporate standardization
    And workplace_elohim tracks customer satisfaction with democratized menu
