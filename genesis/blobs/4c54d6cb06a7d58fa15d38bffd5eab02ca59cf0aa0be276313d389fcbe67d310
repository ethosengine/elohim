Scenario: Neighbors checking on elderly without surveillance feeling
    Given Helen lives alone and neighbors are concerned
    And informal neighborhood care networks exist
    When neighbors check on Helen's wellbeing
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate wellness checks
    And neighbors should be guided to check naturally: "Saw you haven't been out"
    And Helen should experience concern, not surveillance
    And her privacy should be respected
    And neighborhood care should feel organic, not institutional
    And connection should preserve dignity
    And the protocol should facilitate genuine community care
