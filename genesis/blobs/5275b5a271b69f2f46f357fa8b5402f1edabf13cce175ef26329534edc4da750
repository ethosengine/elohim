    Given a corporation claims environmental leadership
    And the journalist investigates actual environmental record
    When the Observer analyzes company's violations and emissions
    Then the journalist finds 23 violations in past 5 years
    And verifies emissions increased despite efficiency claims
    And shows company lobbied against stronger pollution regulations
    And identifies millions in fines that were never paid
    And publishes investigation exposing greenwashing
