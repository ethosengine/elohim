Scenario: Personal agent teaches value literacy as foundational life skill
    Given Kenji is shopping for groceries on his $50/week budget
    And he struggles to identify best nutritional value per dollar
    When Kenji's personal_agent analyzes his shopping choices
    Then the agent should teach him to compare nutrition per cost
    And it should explain "Brown rice gives you 8 servings for $3, while instant rice gives 4 for $4"
    And it should help him identify efficient protein sources
    And the agent should build Kenji's capability to make informed choices
    And value literacy should be taught through practice, not lectures
    And Kenji should develop skills that serve him throughout adult life
