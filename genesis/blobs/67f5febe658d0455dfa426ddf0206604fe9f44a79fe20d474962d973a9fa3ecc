Scenario: Parent advocacy for better educational policies
    Given Sarah understands education from both sides
    And she advocates for family-friendly school policies
    When Sarah participates in educational policy discussions
    Then her dual perspective should be recognized as valuable
    And advocacy labor should accumulate care tokens
    And parent organizing for educational improvement should be valued
    And Sarah's work to improve schools should be community contribution
    And the system should recognize education advocacy as care labor
    And parent voices should be amplified in education governance
