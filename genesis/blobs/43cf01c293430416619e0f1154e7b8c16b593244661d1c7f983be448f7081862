Scenario: Parent educational labor outside formal schooling hours
    Given Sarah teaches Tommy and Emma during evenings and weekends
    And homework support, life skills, critical thinking happen at home
    When the educational_elohim tracks Sarah's teaching time
    Then it should quantify hours spent on educational labor
    And it should recognize teaching homework as skilled instructional work
    And it should value informal education alongside formal instruction
    And Sarah's non-school teaching should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should make invisible educational labor visible
    And parent teaching should be recognized as professional-grade work
