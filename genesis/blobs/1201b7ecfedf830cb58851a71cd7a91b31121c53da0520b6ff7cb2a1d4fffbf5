Scenario: Balancing environmental responsibility with budget constraints
    Given Aisha has limited financial resources
    And sustainable options often cost more
    When Aisha makes purchasing decisions
    Then the personal_agent should help navigate trade-offs
    And it should identify affordable sustainable choices
    And it should explain when spending more reduces environmental impact
    And it should validate doing her best within constraints
    And the system should never shame financial limitations
    And environmental responsibility should be accessible at all income levels
