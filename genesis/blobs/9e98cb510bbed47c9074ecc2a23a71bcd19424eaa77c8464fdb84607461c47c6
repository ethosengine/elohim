Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Adult
  As an adult in the sandwich generation
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to coordinate care across multiple generations
  So that care flows effectively upward, downward, inward, and outward

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the adult user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah is mother to Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And Sarah has a partner
    And Sarah's parents are in their 60s and beginning to need support
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim coordinates multi-generational care economy

  Scenario: Coordinating care across multiple generations simultaneously
    Given Sarah provides care to her children, her partner, and increasingly to her parents
    And she is in the sandwich generation
    When the family_elohim tracks care flows
    Then it should map care moving upward to parents
    And it should track care downward to children
    And it should recognize care inward for Sarah's own well-being
    And it should value care outward to community
    And Sarah should see the full complexity of her care work
    And multi-generational care patterns should be visible

  Scenario: Differentiating children's developmental stages in family care
    Given Tommy (5) needs wonder-preservation and tight boundaries
    And Emma (8) needs guided autonomy and increasing responsibility
    When Sarah coordinates family care activities
    Then the family_elohim should maintain different permission levels
    And Tommy's interactions should preserve developmental appropriateness
    And Emma's interactions should support growing independence
    And Sarah should manage each child's needs specifically
    And developmental stages should be respected within family context

  Scenario: Making Sarah's care contributions visible to extended family
    Given Sarah performs enormous care labor across family contexts
    And extended family may not see the full scope
    When family care contributions are tracked
    Then Sarah's care for children should be quantified
    And her care for aging parents should be visible
    And her household coordination should be recognized
    And extended family should see Sarah's contributions specifically
    And visibility should enable fair family labor distribution

  Scenario: Coordinating care for aging parents across distance
    Given Sarah's parents are in their 60s
    And they live in a different location
    And they're beginning to need support
    When Sarah provides care to her parents
    Then the family_elohim should track care contributions across distance
    And it should coordinate with siblings if present
    And it should help Sarah balance care for parents with care for children
    And elder care should be recognized as substantial care work
    And Sarah should not be overwhelmed by competing family demands

  Scenario: Teaching children value literacy through family care participation
    Given Sarah is raising Tommy and Emma in care economy
    And she wants them to learn value literacy
    When children participate in family care activities
    Then the family_elohim should recognize their age-appropriate contributions
    And Sarah should model care economy principles
    And children should learn by doing within family context
    And family should be primary site of care economy education
    And next generation should assume care economy is normal

  Scenario: Family care tokens accumulate across all members' contributions
    Given family participates in care token economy
    And Sarah, partner, Tommy, and Emma all contribute
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Sarah's extensive contributions should be valued highly
    And children's age-appropriate work should count
    And partner's contributions should be recognized
    And extended family care should be tracked
    And family care tokens should reflect collective contributions
    And tokens should be available for family resource access

  Scenario: Preventing Sarah's burnout through family care coordination
    Given Sarah is at high risk for caregiver burnout
    And she tends to sacrifice herself for family needs
    When the family_elohim monitors care patterns
    Then it should detect when Sarah is giving unsustainably
    And it should surface imbalances before crisis
    And it should prompt other family members to contribute more
    And it should connect Sarah to family support resources
    And the protocol should protect Sarah's capacity to care

  Scenario: Family culture of visible, valued, reciprocal care
    Given Sarah is building family culture around care economy
    And she wants care to be visible and valued by all members
    When family care patterns develop over time
    Then the family_elohim should make all contributions visible
    And recognition should flow in all directions
    And family culture should value care labor explicitly
    And reciprocity should be practiced, not just preached
    And family should become care economy demonstration site

  Scenario: Coordinating family care with partner in equitable partnership
    Given Sarah and partner share parenting responsibilities
    And they're raising children together
    When family care labor is distributed
    Then the family_elohim should track both partners' contributions
    And labor should be distributed equitably
    And neither partner should bear unfair burden
    And children should see modeled equitable partnership
    And family governance should be genuinely shared

  Scenario: Extended family care reciprocity across generations
    Given Sarah's parents provided care for her as a child
    And she's now providing care to them as they age
    When multi-generational care patterns are tracked
    Then the family_elohim should recognize reciprocal care flows
    And care should be seen as flowing both ways across time
    And Sarah's care for parents should be valued
    And parents' previous care for Sarah should be acknowledged
    And multi-generational reciprocity should be visible

  Scenario: Family resource allocation reflects all members' contributions
    Given family makes decisions about major resource allocation
    And multiple members contribute in different ways
    When family decisions are made
    Then all members' care contributions should be considered
    And Sarah's care work should give her legitimate standing
    And children's contributions should be recognized appropriately
    And resource decisions should reflect visible care patterns
    And family economics should honor care creates value

  Scenario: Family privacy protected while coordinating across contexts
    Given family care economy involves multiple family members
    And privacy needs differ across individuals
    When family data is managed
    Then Sarah should control what's shared with extended family
    And children's privacy should be protected by parental oversight
    And partner's privacy should be respected
    And extended family should only see what Sarah chooses to share
    And family privacy should be complex, nuanced, and protected
