Scenario: Community resource allocation recognizes volunteer contributions
    Given Frank provides substantial volunteer labor
    And community resources are limited
    When the community_elohim influences resource allocation
    Then Frank's contributions should be visible in allocation decisions
    And his care tokens should provide access to community resources
    And volunteers should not face additional burden from low income
    And community resources should flow to contributors equitably
    And Frank's volunteer work should be recognized through material support
    And care economy should function as mutual aid, not charity
