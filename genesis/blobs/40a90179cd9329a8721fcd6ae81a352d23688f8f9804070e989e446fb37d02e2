Scenario: Appeal reveals systematic bias across multiple communities
    Given similar appeals have been filed across many communities in the region
    And a pattern suggests systematic issue not isolated incidents
    When I file my appeal as part of this broader pattern
    Then Regional Constitutional Council treats this as systemic review
    And Researcher provides analysis of the appeal pattern data
    And They investigate if protocol implementation has regional bias
    And They examine if certain demographics are disproportionately affected
    And They may order regional protocol audit or recalibration
    And My individual appeal becomes part of systemic justice work
    And Constitutional accountability operates at scale not just individual cases
