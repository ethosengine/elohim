Scenario: Recognizing resource constraint as ecological practice
    Given Kenji's $180/week budget forces minimal consumption
    And ecological sustainability requires reduced consumption
    When the bioregional_elohim reframes Kenji's scarcity
    Then it should recognize that living on limited resources is low ecological impact
    And it should validate "Your minimal consumption is ecological stewardship"
    And it should show how his constrained lifestyle aligns with sustainability
    And resource constraint should be recognized as ecological care
    And the system should honor scarcity as ecological practice
    And Kenji should understand his poverty as inadvertently sustainable
