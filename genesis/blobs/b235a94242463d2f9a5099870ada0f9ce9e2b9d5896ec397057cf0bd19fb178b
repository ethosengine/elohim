Scenario: Navigating medical equipment needs with dignity
    Given Alex requires various medical equipment and devices
    And equipment access is often bureaucratic and dehumanizing
    When Alex needs medical equipment
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex navigate equipment systems
    And it should track equipment needs and maintenance schedules
    And it should help Alex advocate for appropriate equipment
    And it should document when insurance denies necessary equipment
    And Alex should maintain dignity throughout equipment acquisition
    And the protocol should reduce bureaucratic burden
    And equipment should be framed as essential tools, not medical devices
