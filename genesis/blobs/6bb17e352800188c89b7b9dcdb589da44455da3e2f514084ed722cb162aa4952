Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent
  As a single parent managing solo household responsibilities
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want to maintain personal autonomy and identity despite overwhelming care demands
  So that I can sustain myself while providing superhuman care for my family

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the single parent user "Maria" is registered in the system
    And Maria is a 38-year-old single mother of three children (ages 6, 9, and 14)
    And Maria works full-time as a medical assistant earning $42k/year
    And Maria carries 100% of household care labor with no co-parent support
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Maria's personal_agent provides cognitive partnership support

  Scenario: Personal agent serves as thinking partner for overwhelming decisions
    Given Maria faces countless decisions daily with no co-parent to consult
    And she manages children's needs, household economics, work schedule, and logistics alone
    When Maria needs to make a complex decision
    Then her personal_agent should function as cognitive co-parent
    And it should help her think through decisions systematically
    And it should surface important factors she might miss in exhaustion
    And it should track patterns and provide analysis
    And it should support her sovereignty without imposing its own agenda
    And Maria should have the thinking partnership that coupled parents get from each other

  Scenario: Protecting tiny spaces for Maria's personal identity and flourishing
    Given Maria's life is consumed by parenting and work demands
    And she has almost no time or energy for herself
    When the personal_agent monitors Maria's well-being
    Then it should identify and protect small moments for personal care
    And it should remind Maria that she exists beyond her parenting role
    And it should help her maintain individual identity despite overwhelming demands
    And it should advocate for her personal needs, not just children's needs
    And Maria should be supported in being a person, not just a parent

  Scenario: Crisis detection when Maria approaches physical or emotional breakdown
    Given Maria operates at unsustainable intensity with no backup
    And she cannot afford to collapse because there's no one else
    When the personal_agent monitors Maria's health and stress levels
    Then it should detect warning signs of approaching breakdown
    And it should alert Maria before crisis becomes emergency
    And it should proactively surface support options
    And it should connect her to emergency resources if needed
    And it should treat Maria's well-being as critical infrastructure for family survival

  Scenario: Validating Maria's superhuman efforts without toxic positivity
    Given Maria performs extraordinary care labor daily
    And society often dismisses or pities single parents
    When the personal_agent provides feedback to Maria
    Then it should genuinely recognize her superhuman work
    And it should validate the weight of solo parenting
    And it should avoid toxic positivity that dismisses her struggles
    And it should acknowledge both her strength and her legitimate exhaustion
    And Maria should feel truly seen, not patronized

  Scenario: Supporting Maria's boundaries against impossible external demands
    Given everyone wants more from Maria—employers, schools, children, family, community
    And she has finite capacity with no partner to share load
    When external demands are placed on Maria
    Then the personal_agent should monitor her total commitments
    And it should help her evaluate what she can realistically handle
    And it should support her in saying no when necessary
    And it should remind her that she's already doing more than humanly sustainable
    And Maria should have AI support for boundary-setting

  Scenario: Cognitive load management when mental labor is overwhelming
    Given Maria tracks countless details across three children's lives plus household plus work
    And she has no partner to share the mental load
    When Maria's cognitive load becomes unsustainable
    Then the personal_agent should actively hold complexity for her
    And it should remember what she can't
    And it should surface important details at the right time
    And it should reduce rather than increase mental labor
    And Maria should have external cognitive support that makes solo parenting more manageable

  Scenario: Decision fatigue support when every choice drains limited capacity
    Given Maria makes hundreds of decisions daily with no co-parent
    And decision fatigue is real and debilitating
    When the personal_agent detects decision fatigue
    Then it should simplify choices where possible
    And it should provide clear recommendations based on her values and constraints
    And it should reduce decision burden without removing her autonomy
    And it should help her conserve decision-making capacity for critical choices
    And Maria should experience reduced cognitive drain from constant choices

  Scenario: Sleep deprivation monitoring and intervention
    Given Maria wakes at 5am and collapses near midnight daily
    And chronic sleep deprivation damages health and capacity
    When the personal_agent tracks Maria's sleep patterns
    Then it should monitor for dangerous sleep deprivation
    And it should advocate for more rest when possible
    And it should help her find efficiency that creates sleep time
    And it should alert her when sleep deprivation threatens her health
    And Maria should have support for this basic but often impossible need

  Scenario: Financial anxiety management with realistic resource planning
    Given Maria constantly calculates whether she can afford necessities
    And financial stress pervades every decision
    When Maria faces financial decisions
    Then the personal_agent should provide clear financial analysis
    And it should help her see trade-offs and options
    And it should reduce anxiety through better planning and visibility
    And it should help her make informed choices within severe constraints
    And Maria should feel more financial agency despite limited resources

  Scenario: Preventing isolation through connection to support networks
    Given solo parenting is profoundly isolating
    And Maria has no co-parent for adult connection and support
    When the personal_agent monitors Maria's social connections
    Then it should detect isolation and loneliness
    And it should help her connect to other single parents
    And it should facilitate community support without requiring more labor from her
    And it should treat social connection as essential, not optional
    And Maria should have pathways out of isolation despite time constraints

  Scenario: Personal care token accumulation reflects superhuman solo work
    Given Maria performs the work of two parents plus household management plus breadwinning
    And her care contributions are extraordinary
    When Maria's care tokens are calculated
    Then they should reflect that she's doing multiple full-time jobs
    And solo parenting should be valued higher than partnered parenting
    And her care tokens should accumulate at accelerated rate
    And the protocol should make undeniable her superhuman care labor
    And Maria should see quantified recognition of work society often dismisses

  Scenario: Maintaining hope and forward vision despite overwhelming present
    Given Maria's daily reality is exhausting and relentless
    And it's easy to lose hope when drowning in impossible demands
    When the personal_agent provides long-term perspective
    Then it should help Maria see beyond today's crisis
    And it should remind her that children grow and demands will eventually shift
    And it should celebrate progress and acknowledge her endurance
    And it should maintain realistic hope without minimizing current struggles
    And Maria should be supported in keeping vision of a sustainable future
