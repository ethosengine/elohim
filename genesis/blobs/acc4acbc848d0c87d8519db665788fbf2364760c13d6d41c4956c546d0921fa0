Scenario: Organizer creates accessible materials on community benefits agreement
    Given developer seeks public subsidy for major project
    And promises to "create jobs" but history shows otherwise
    When the organizer requests education materials from Observer
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of community benefits agreements
    And see developer's labor track record from past projects
    And get template for CBA with binding labor standards
    And access wage and hiring data to counter developer claims
    And complex economic development becomes community organizing opportunity
