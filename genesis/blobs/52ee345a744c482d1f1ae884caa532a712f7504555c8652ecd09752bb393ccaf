Scenario: Politician navigates high-stakes testing debate with outcome focus
    Given testing requirements create political controversy
    And both supporters and critics make competing claims
    When the Observer analyzes testing data and educational impacts
    Then they see how much instructional time testing consumes
    And understand what testing reveals versus distorts about learning
    And identify schools where testing drives harmful practices
    And review alternative assessment models in other states
    And balance accountability needs with teaching and learning quality
