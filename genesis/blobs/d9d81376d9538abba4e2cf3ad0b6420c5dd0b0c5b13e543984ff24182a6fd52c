Scenario: Fair compensation based on witnessed value creation
    Given Maria's 8 years of invisible contributions are now documented
    And her REA profile shows training, conflict prevention, and optimization work
    When the democratic workplace calculates compensation
    Then Maria receives $28/hour instead of previous $11/hour
    And her training contributions (47 hours) are compensated
    And her conflict resolution (12 incidents prevented) generates recognized value
    And her efficiency gains (2.3 hours daily saved) benefit her, not just corporate
    And transparent algorithms show exactly how her compensation is calculated
