Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent
  As a single parent managing solo household operations
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want efficient household management with AI support replacing missing co-parent
  So that my household thrives despite having only one adult making all decisions

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the single parent user "Maria" is registered in the system
    And Maria manages a household of four (herself and three children ages 6, 9, and 14)
    And Maria has no co-parent to share decision-making or household labor
    And household income is $42k/year from Maria's sole employment
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim coordinates household operations

  Scenario: Household governance as necessary autocracy with age-appropriate child input
    Given Maria is the only adult making every household decision
    And children need appropriate voice based on developmental stage
    When household decisions are made
    Then the household_elohim should support Maria's final authority
    And it should help her gather age-appropriate input from children
    And her 14-year-old should have more voice than younger children
    And her 6-year-old should have simple choices within boundaries
    And household governance should be efficient while respecting all members
    And Maria should maintain control without becoming authoritarian

  Scenario: Extreme budget management with $42k for four people
    Given Maria supports four people on $42k annual income
    And this requires maximizing every dollar
    When Maria makes purchasing decisions
    Then the household_elohim should track spending against severe constraints
    And it should help her find the efficiency frontier for every category
    And it should identify savings opportunities across housing, food, utilities, necessities
    And it should help her make informed trade-offs between competing needs
    And Maria should have sophisticated support for household economics under constraint

  Scenario: Grocery management with $175 per week for four people
    Given Maria feeds four people on $175/week budget
    And this requires strategic planning and waste prevention
    When Maria plans grocery shopping
    Then the household_elohim should optimize for maximum nutrition per dollar
    And it should coordinate strategic shopping across stores based on sales
    And it should plan meals that stretch ingredients efficiently
    And it should prevent food waste she cannot afford
    And Maria should achieve remarkable efficiency with AI support

  Scenario: Solo household labor tracking shows work of two parents
    Given Maria performs all household labor alone
    And she does cooking, cleaning, laundry, maintenance, logistics, planning
    When household labor is tracked
    Then the household_elohim should quantify all of Maria's work
    And it should make visible that she's doing work normally split between two adults
    And tracking should validate that solo parenting is literally double the labor
    And Maria's care token accumulation should reflect superhuman household contribution
    And society should see quantified proof of single parents' extraordinary work

  Scenario: Coordinating three children's different developmental needs simultaneously
    Given Maria parents a 6-year-old, 9-year-old, and 14-year-old alone
    And each child has completely different needs, schedules, and emotional requirements
    When Maria manages children's needs
    Then the household_elohim should help her track each child's developmental stage
    And it should coordinate different school schedules and activities
    And it should remind her of each child's unique needs
    And it should prevent younger children from being neglected due to teen's demands
    And Maria should have AI support for impossible multi-child coordination

  Scenario: Emergency household backup when Maria is sick or overwhelmed
    Given Maria has no co-parent to tag in during crisis
    And she must parent even when sick or exhausted
    When Maria faces personal emergency or is at breaking point
    Then the household_elohim should detect crisis situation
    And it should activate emergency backup networks
    And it should connect to neighbors who can provide temporary support
    And it should help coordinate emergency meal provision or childcare
    And Maria should have safety net for the inevitable times she cannot function alone

  Scenario: Oldest child becoming household partner without losing childhood
    Given Maria's 14-year-old is becoming a genuine household contributor
    And this is necessary given their circumstances
    When the household_elohim tracks the teen's contributions
    Then it should recognize his age-appropriate household help
    And it should warn if he's taking on too much adult responsibility
    And it should help Maria preserve his childhood while accepting necessary help
    And it should prevent parentification while valuing legitimate contribution
    And the protocol should navigate this concerning but realistic dynamic carefully

  Scenario: Household maintenance with no partner to share repairs and tasks
    Given Maria handles all household repairs, maintenance, and problem-solving alone
    And she has limited time, money, and often limited technical knowledge
    When household maintenance needs arise
    Then the household_elohim should provide decision support for repairs
    And it should help her evaluate DIY versus hiring professionals
    And it should connect her to affordable service providers when needed
    And it should coordinate with neighbors for skill-sharing and tool-borrowing
    And Maria should have support for household maintenance without a partner

  Scenario: Logistics coordination nightmare with three children's schedules
    Given Maria coordinates school, after-school care, activities, appointments for three children
    And she manages this alone while working full-time
    When daily logistics need coordination
    Then the household_elohim should integrate all schedules
    And it should identify conflicts before they become crises
    And it should suggest solutions for impossible timing situations
    And it should coordinate with other parents for pickup/dropoff sharing
    And Maria should have AI co-parent for logistical complexity

  Scenario: Household resilience planning for single-adult vulnerability
    Given Maria's household depends entirely on her continued functioning
    And there's no backup adult if something happens to her
    When the household_elohim assesses resilience
    Then it should help Maria create emergency plans for if she's incapacitated
    And it should identify emergency contacts for children
    And it should coordinate with extended family or community for backup care
    And it should ensure children know what to do in various emergencies
    And Maria should have peace of mind that children will be cared for if she can't

  Scenario: Bedtime routine for three different ages managed solo
    Given Maria manages three different bedtime routines alone
    And she handles 6-year-old's needs, 9-year-old's independence, and teen's later schedule
    When evening household operations occur
    Then the household_elohim should coordinate efficient bedtime sequences
    And it should help Maria provide age-appropriate attention to each child
    And it should prevent exhaustion from serial one-on-one bedtime needs
    And it should preserve connection time with each child despite time constraints
    And Maria should manage impossible evening demands with better coordination

  Scenario: Household care tokens include supplements for single-parent resource constraints
    Given Maria's household operates on severely limited income
    And the Value Scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then Maria should receive care token supplements based on income level
    And her single-parent status should qualify for enhanced support
    And supplements should enable continued participation without financial barrier
    And care economy should function as economic support system
    And access should be dignified, never requiring means-tested humiliation
