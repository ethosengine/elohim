Scenario: Participating in composting and food waste reduction
    Given restaurants generate significant compostable waste
    And composting returns nutrients to soil and supports local ecology
    When I want to participate in composting initiatives
    Then the protocol should connect me to composting programs
    And recognize participation in waste reduction as care work
    And support workplace implementation of composting
    And contribute to bioregional nutrient cycling and soil health
