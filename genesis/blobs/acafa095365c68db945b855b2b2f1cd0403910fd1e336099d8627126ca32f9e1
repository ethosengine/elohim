Scenario: Privacy protection for sensitive household circumstances
    Given Marcus's household situation must be protected
    And his family's economic constraints are private information
    When Marcus's care contributions are tracked
    Then his specific circumstances must not be broadcast
    And data about shopping patterns must remain confidential
    And community resource coordination should use anonymized data
    And his privacy should be protected even while receiving support
    And no stigmatizing exposure of family situation should occur
