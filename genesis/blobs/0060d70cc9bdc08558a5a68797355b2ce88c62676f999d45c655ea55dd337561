Scenario: Educational design prevents formation of consumer identity
    Given consumer capitalism targets children for identity formation
    And Tommy is highly vulnerable to conditioning
    When Tommy learns through the Value Scanner
    Then no gamification should train extraction thinking
    And no points systems should create achievement addiction
    And no rewards should condition consumption behavior
    And identity formation should center on care, not acquisition
    And Tommy should learn to see himself as contributor, not consumer
