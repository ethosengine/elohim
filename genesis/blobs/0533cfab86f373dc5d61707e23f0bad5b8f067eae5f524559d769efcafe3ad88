Scenario: Preventing workplace stress from undermining academic success
    Given Kenji's work adds stress to already-intense academic load
    And excessive work hours can threaten educational outcomes
    When the workplace_elohim monitors Kenji's work-study balance
    Then it should flag when work hours threaten academic performance
    And it should help him identify when to reduce hours
    And it should validate that education is his primary work right now
    And it should support him prioritizing school over work when necessary
    And the system should prevent work from derailing educational investment
    And Kenji's long-term development should take precedence over immediate income
