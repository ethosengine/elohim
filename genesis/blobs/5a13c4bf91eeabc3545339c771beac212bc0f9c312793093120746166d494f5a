Scenario: Investigate whether protocol governance quality degrades as it scales
    Given protocol expanded from dozens to thousands of communities
    When James examines governance quality metrics over scale

    And he examines whether coordination complexity overwhelms benefits
    And he finds quality generally sustains but identifies scaling challenges
    And research informs protocol architecture improvements
