Scenario: Farm transitions from private land to community food security institution
    Given Johnson Farm was Tom's private property serving his individual livelihood
    And community depended on farm but had no governance participation
    When farm converts to democratic ownership with community investment
    Then community investors gain stake in local food production
    And farm governance includes community voice alongside farmworker control
    And food security becomes community priority, not just individual profit
    And farmland is protected from development through community commitment
    And community_elohim facilitates community participation in farm governance
