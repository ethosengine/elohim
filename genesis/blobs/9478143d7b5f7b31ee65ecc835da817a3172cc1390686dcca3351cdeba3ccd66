Scenario: Planning commissioner understands community concerns beyond testimony
    Given commission considers rezoning to allow commercial development in residential area
    And supporters include business owners and economic development advocates who testified
    And only 8 residents attended meeting to oppose
    When the commissioner seeks community accountability data from Observer
    Then they see survey data from neighborhood residents showing strong opposition
    And discover working families couldn't attend evening meeting to testify
    And access analysis showing traffic and noise impacts on residential area
    And understand broader community concerns beyond who had time to testify
    And community accountability helps commissioner serve constituent interests
