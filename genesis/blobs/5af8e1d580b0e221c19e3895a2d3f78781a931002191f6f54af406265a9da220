Scenario: Household governance includes children at appropriate developmental levels
    Given Tommy (5) and Emma (8) are household members
    And they contribute care labor at age-appropriate levels
    When household decisions are made
    Then children should have voice appropriate to their development
    And Emma should have more input than Tommy
    And both should experience participating in household governance
    And the household_elohim should coordinate different permission levels
    And family democracy should be practiced, not just taught
