Scenario: Homework support expectations realistic for single parent households
    Given Maria manages homework support for three children across different grade levels
    And she does this after full workday while managing dinner, household, and bedtime
    When schools assign homework requiring parent support
    Then the educational_elohim should advocate for realistic homework expectations
    And assignments should not assume extensive parent availability or expertise
    And schools should recognize single parents have limited capacity to support homework
    And children should not be penalized for single parent's time constraints
    And homework policies should account for diverse family circumstances
