Scenario: Margaret's own elder care work made visible to family
    Given Margaret coordinates care for her 92-year-old mother
    And she navigates "sandwich generation" care obligations
    When the family_elohim tracks Margaret's elder care
    Then it should recognize this as substantial care labor
    And it should show Margaret is caring across three generations
    And Sarah should see Margaret's total care burden
    And grandchildren should see Margaret modeling elder care
    And elder care should accumulate care tokens alongside grandparenting
    And family should understand Margaret's comprehensive care work
    And her care for her own mother should be visible and valued
