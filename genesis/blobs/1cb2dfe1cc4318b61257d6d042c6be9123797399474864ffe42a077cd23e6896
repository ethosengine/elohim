Scenario: Natural experiment comparing communities with vs without protocol
    Given some adjacent communities adopted protocol while neighbors didn't
    And these communities are similar in demographics and economics
    When I study outcomes comparing adopters to non-adopters
    Then I isolate: protocol effects from confounding factors
    And I measure: differences in wellbeing, crisis response, social cohesion
    And I examine: spillover effects across community boundaries
    And I analyze: why some communities adopted and others resisted
    And I provide: quasi-experimental evidence about causality
    And My findings distinguish: correlation from causation in protocol effects
    And Evidence serves policymakers deciding whether to support adoption
