Scenario: Customizable interaction modes support diverse capabilities
    Given Alex's capabilities vary day to day
    And fatigue, pain, or other factors affect what's accessible
    When Alex uses the Value Scanner on different days
    Then Alex should be able to switch between interaction modes easily
    And voice, touch, keyboard, and switch access should all be available
    And the system should remember Alex's preferences per context
    And Alex should not have to repeatedly explain needs
    And flexible modes should accommodate fluctuating capabilities
    And the interface should adapt to Alex, not force Alex to adapt
