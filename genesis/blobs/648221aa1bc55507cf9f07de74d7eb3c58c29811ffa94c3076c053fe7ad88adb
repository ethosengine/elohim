Scenario: Appealing family emergency decision in crisis
    Given during a family emergency Family Elohim made rapid decisions
    And I believe the urgency didn't justify the privacy violations
    When I file an appeal after the crisis has passed
    Then the Constitutional Council evaluates if emergency protocols were properly invoked
    And They examine if the agent demonstrated proportionality under urgency
    And They consider if less invasive emergency responses were available
    And They assess if family members were informed as quickly as possible
    And The appeal establishes precedent for emergency intervention thresholds
    And Protocol improvements address crisis decision-making procedures
