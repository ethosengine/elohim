Scenario: Young child's care work made visible to family
    Given Tommy has chosen strawberries for his sister Emma
    And the care contribution has been recorded by personal_agent
    When the family_elohim processes the contribution
    Then Tommy's care work should be visible on the family dashboard
    And parent Sarah should receive specific prompts
    And the prompt should say "Tommy chose strawberries for Emma"
    And the care contribution should be attributed to Tommy by name
    And family care tokens should reflect his contribution
    And the visibility should enable parental recognition
