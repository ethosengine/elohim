Scenario: Journalist tracks climate commitments to accountability
    Given city and state announced climate action plans
    And the journalist covered initial announcements
    When the Observer monitors climate policy implementation
    Then the journalist finds emissions reduction targets are not being met
    And sees policies that would reduce emissions remain unimplemented
    And identifies budget cuts to climate programs despite commitments
    And documents gap between climate rhetoric and action
    And publishes accountability story on broken climate promises
