Scenario: Learning from protocol outcomes to improve legislation
    Given Constitutional Convention passed adolescent autonomy amendment
    And this reflects accumulated precedents and appeals
    When I translate constitutional evolution into state law
    Then I craft: legislation operationalizing the amendment
    And I update: state family law to reflect constitutional principle
    And I modify: education policy honoring developing autonomy
    And constitutional evolution: informs statutory law
    And I demonstrate: how different democratic forms work together
