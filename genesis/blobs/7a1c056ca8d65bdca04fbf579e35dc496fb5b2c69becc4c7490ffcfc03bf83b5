Scenario: Child blocked from exposure to harmful content
    Given Emma's uncle shares a news article about violence
    And the content is appropriate for adults but not children
    When the article is contributed to the family space
    Then the guardian agent evaluates age-appropriateness
    And Emma's view is automatically filtered or summarized
    And her parents can choose to discuss the topic with her directly
    And Emma never sees graphic or traumatizing content
    And family communication continues without disruption
