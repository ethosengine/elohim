Scenario: Teen's worker rights protected through municipal care economy
    Given Jasmine works part-time in retail
    And municipal labor regulations apply to her employment
    When municipal_elohim monitors workplace conditions
    Then it should track whether young workers are fairly treated
    And flag systematic exploitation of teen labor
    And surface if employers violate youth labor laws
    And aggregate data about teen working conditions
    And inform municipal labor policy enforcement
    And protect young workers through care economy transparency
