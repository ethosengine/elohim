Scenario: Care tokens flow between independent adult and family
    Given Aisha both contributes to and receives from family
    And care flows in multiple directions
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Aisha's contributions should generate tokens
    And she should be able to use tokens for family support when needed
    And parents' ongoing care should be recognized
    And reciprocal care should be tracked transparently
    And the family care economy should adapt to her independence
    And adult family relationships should involve mutual care
