Scenario: Fair compensation and wage theft prevention
    Given Kenji depends on every dollar he earns
    And low-wage employers sometimes violate wage laws
    When the workplace_elohim monitors Kenji's compensation
    Then it should verify he's paid for all hours worked
    And it should flag if he's working off-clock or unpaid
    And it should teach him to recognize wage theft
    And it should help him assert right to legal minimum wage
    And the system should protect vulnerable student workers from exploitation
    And Kenji should receive every penny he earns
