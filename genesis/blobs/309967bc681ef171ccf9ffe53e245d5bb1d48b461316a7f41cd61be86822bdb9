Scenario: Receiving community support framed as reciprocal care, not charity
    Given I need substantial support with resources, childcare, and crisis navigation
    And I worry about being seen as "taker" or burden
    When I access community support through care economy network
    Then the Value Scanner frames support as reciprocal care, not charity
    And recognizes my parenting labor as valuable care contribution
    And validates that everyone needs support during vulnerability
    And connects me to support based on my care economy participation
    And ensures support is offered with dignity and respect
    And my personal_agent helps me access help without shame
    And tracks my ongoing care contributions even during crisis
    And validates that receiving support when needed is how care economy works
