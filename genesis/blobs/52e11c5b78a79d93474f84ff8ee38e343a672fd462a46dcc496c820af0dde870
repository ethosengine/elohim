Scenario: Identifying need for capability limits until problems solved
    Given agents approach human comprehension limits
    And National Council questions if oversight remains meaningful
    When I assess whether democratic governance can continue
    Then I honestly acknowledge: limits of our technical understanding
    And I clarify: what can and cannot be verified currently
    And I explore: research pathways to better explainability
    And I may recommend: limiting agent capability until oversight works
    And I accept: that this may slow AI development
    And I prioritize: democratic governance over technical optimization
    And I demonstrate: humility about technological limits
