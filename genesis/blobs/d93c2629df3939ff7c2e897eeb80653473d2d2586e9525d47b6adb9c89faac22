Scenario: Activist prevents movement co-optation by bad actors
    Given a corporate-funded organization tries to join the network
    And they claim to support climate action but oppose systemic change
    When they attempt to participate in network coordination
    Then their limited community trust becomes visible
    And their ties to fossil fuel funding are surfaced through documentation
    And the network collectively evaluates the participation request
    And communities share experiences with similar co-optation attempts
    And the network maintains boundaries while remaining open to good-faith participation
    And the movement's integrity is protected through transparent evaluation
