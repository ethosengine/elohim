Scenario: Activist connects workplace justice to municipal budget
    Given city approved $5M tax break for developer
    But refused to fund $500K worker center
    When the Observer makes budget trade-offs visible
    Then the activist exposes value priorities (corporate welfare vs worker support)
    And shows developer already profitable without subsidy
    And demonstrates worker center's community economic impact
    And organizes campaign to redirect public resources
    And municipal priorities become labor justice battleground
