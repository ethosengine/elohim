Scenario: Teacher advocates for evidence-based special education practices
    Given students with learning differences need specialized support
    And current special education approach is compliance-focused not learning-focused
    When teachers coordinate around special education reform through Observer
    Then teachers document what actually helps students with diverse needs
    And share successful inclusive practices across schools
    And identify barriers to effective special education (caseloads, resources, training)
    And build coalition with parents of students with disabilities
    And special education becomes about student learning not just paperwork
