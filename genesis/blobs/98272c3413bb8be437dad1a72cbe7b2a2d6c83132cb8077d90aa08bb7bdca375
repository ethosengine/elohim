Scenario: Recognizing food systems care work from field to table
    Given my restaurant work is one link in food systems care chain
    And farmers, distributors, and preparers all contribute care labor
    When I view food systems through care economy lens
    Then the protocol should make visible the care work in entire food chain
    And help me understand my connection to farmers and food producers
    And recognize that all food work is care labor serving human nourishment
    And build consciousness about care economy in food systems
