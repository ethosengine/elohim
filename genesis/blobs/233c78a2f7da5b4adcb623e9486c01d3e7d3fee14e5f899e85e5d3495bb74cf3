Scenario: Rebuilding family identity and culture after leaving abuse
    Given my family culture was defined by abusive dynamics
    And I am creating new family identity with my children
    When I establish new family values, traditions, and norms
    Then the family_elohim helps me articulate our family values
    And supports creation of new family traditions that reflect our healing
    And helps children understand our family transformation
    And tracks what family practices we want to keep vs. change
    And validates that redefining family is important work
    And my personal_agent helps me communicate family values consistently
    And recognizes family culture creation as substantial care work
    And celebrates our family becoming who we want to be
