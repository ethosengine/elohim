Scenario: Activist creates cross-geographic climate justice network
    Given activists in 40 cities are working on climate action
    And they share commitment to Indigenous leadership and just transition
    When a founding group creates a climate justice affinity network
    And they establish network charter emphasizing subsidiarity and equity
    And they invite activists from participating communities
    Then the affinity network space is created
    And participants maintain connection to their local communities
    And the network provides coordination without centralized control
    And local autonomy is preserved while enabling collective action
    And shared resources, tactics, and patterns flow through the network
