Scenario: Navigating sibling relationships as equals
    Given Jordan has two younger siblings who are now adults
    And sibling relationships are evolving
    When Jordan's siblings gather for a family event
    Then Jordan participates as a peer adult sibling
    And the Value Scanner helps coordinate sibling care exchanges
    And Jordan's contributions to siblings are recognized (encouragement, presence)
    And siblings treat Jordan as brother/sister, not as someone to manage
    And the family_elohim helps siblings navigate appropriate support
    And Jordan experiences adult sibling relationships
