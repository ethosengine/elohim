Scenario: Bioregional food networks could serve families like Marcus's
    Given Marcus's family struggles with food budget
    And bioregional food networks could provide affordable access
    When the community_elohim identifies bioregional opportunities
    Then it should connect Marcus to local food networks
    And it should help him access CSA programs, food cooperatives, gleaning
    And bioregional connection should reduce his economic burden
    And local food systems should serve food security goals
    And care economy should operate at bioregional scale
    And connection to land and farmers should benefit all parties
