Scenario: Farm becomes community educational site for agricultural literacy
    Given urban and suburban residents are disconnected from food production
    And children don't understand where food comes from or how it's grown
    When democratic farm opens to community for education
    Then school groups visit farm learning about agriculture and ecology
    And community members participate in volunteer farm days
    And workshops teach home gardening, food preservation, and nutrition
    And agricultural literacy increases throughout community
    And community_elohim coordinates educational programming at democratic farm
