Scenario: Advocating for protocol sovereignty in international forums
    Given international organizations discuss AI regulation
    And some proposals would mandate centralization
    When I advocate for democratic governance principles
    Then I argue: governments shouldn't mandate protocol architecture
    And I promote: community sovereignty as democratic principle
    And I defend: right of communities to adopt or reject protocol
    And I present: evidence that protocol sovereignty works
    And I resist: international regulation enabling authoritarian capture
    And I build: coalition of democratic nations supporting autonomy
    And I protect: space for democratic AI governance globally
