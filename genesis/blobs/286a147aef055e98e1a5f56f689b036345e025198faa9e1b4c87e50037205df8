Scenario: Municipal business licensing and regulation adapt to democratic ownership
    Given regulations were designed for traditional hierarchical businesses
    And democratic governance may not fit standard regulatory categories
    When Rosa's Auto navigates municipal licensing as democratic enterprise
    Then business license accurately reflects worker-owned cooperative structure
    And regulatory compliance is streamlined for democratic businesses
    And municipal officials learn how to support rather than obstruct conversions
    And regulatory framework evolves to accommodate democratic governance
    And municipality_elohim coordinates with officials to develop supportive policies
