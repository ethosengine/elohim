Scenario: Democratic food service becomes recognized industry sector category
    Given food service is categorized as: fast food chains, casual dining, fine dining, etc.
    And democratic ownership is not recognized as distinct sector category
    When democratic conversions reach critical mass and visibility
    Then "democratic food service" becomes recognized industry category
    And industry publications, conferences, and research treat it as distinct sector
    And consumers seek out democratic establishments, creating market demand
    And sector identity builds pride and coordination among democratic food service workers and operators
    And industry_sector_elohim advocates for democratic food service sector recognition and support
