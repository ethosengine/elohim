Scenario: Privacy protection in community care participation
    Given Marcus participates in community care economy
    And his family's specific circumstances are sensitive
    When community resource coordination occurs
    Then Marcus's privacy must be absolutely protected
    And only anonymized data should be visible to community coordinators
    And his specific situation should not be broadcast
    And community support should flow without exposing private struggles
    And dignity requires privacy even while participating in networks
    And the protocol should enable solidarity without surveillance
