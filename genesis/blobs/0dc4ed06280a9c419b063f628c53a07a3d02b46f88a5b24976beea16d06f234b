Scenario: Citizen decodes education policy jargon
    Given the school board discusses "instructional efficiency optimization"
    And the citizen attends or reviews the meeting
    When the Observer translates the education-ese
    Then the citizen learns this means cutting teaching assistants
    And understands the impact is larger class sizes
    And sees the real effect on children's learning
    And can respond to actual impacts vs bureaucratic language
    And education policy becomes accessible to non-experts
