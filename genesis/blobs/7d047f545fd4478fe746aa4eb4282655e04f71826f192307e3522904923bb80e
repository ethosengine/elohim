Scenario: Developer community benefits agreement gains enforcement mechanism
    Given a developer negotiated affordable housing units as approval condition
    And promised childcare facility and public greenspace
    When the Observer tracks commitment delivery
    Then community members monitor construction and occupancy
    And see whether affordable units are actually rented to qualifying residents
    And track whether childcare facility opens as promised
    And developer reputation depends on honoring commitments
    And binding accountability replaces unenforceable promises
