Scenario: Student voice in educational governance and policy
    Given students are primary stakeholders in education
    And educational policies directly affect student well-being
    When students participate in educational governance
    Then the educational_elohim should recognize advocacy as care contribution
    And it should value student organizing for better policies
    And it should accumulate care tokens for participating in governance
    And student voice should be central to educational decision-making
    And the system should amplify student participation in education policy
    And students should govern their educational institutions democratically
