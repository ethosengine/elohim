Scenario: Elder care financial coordination across family
    Given Robert's parents' care costs are increasing
    And long-term care may eventually be needed
    And financial planning needs to involve siblings
    When family_elohim coordinates elder care financing
    Then it should help siblings discuss financial responsibility
    And surface each sibling's capacity to contribute financially
    And track actual financial contributions to parent care
    And help coordinate long-term care insurance, Medicare, and family support
    And ensure parents' dignity is protected in financial discussions
    And prevent financial burden from falling entirely on one sibling
    And support transparent, equitable financial planning
