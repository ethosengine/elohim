Scenario: Lifecycle consumption awareness from birth through end-of-life
    Given Robert has observed full lifecycle from grandchildren to aging parents
    And he recognizes consumption patterns across lifespan
    And lifecycle awareness can inform sustainable choices
    When bioregional_elohim supports lifecycle consumption awareness
    Then it should help Robert understand consumption across full lifecycle
    And surface how current choices affect future generations' ecological inheritance
    And recognize: "Reducing consumption now preserves resources for grandchildren's future"
    And connect present choices to long-term bioregional health
    And support sustainable consumption motivated by intergenerational care
    And demonstrate that ecological stewardship is care for future generations
    And build consumption patterns that serve lifecycle sustainability
