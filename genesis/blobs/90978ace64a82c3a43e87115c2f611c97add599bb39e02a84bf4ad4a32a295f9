Scenario: Journalist fact-checks superintendent claims on achievement
    Given the superintendent presents glowing achievement data
    And the journalist provides accountability coverage
    When the Observer analyzes district outcome data
    Then the journalist verifies overall test score increase (true)
    And finds achievement gap between white and Black students widened
    And shows gains concentrated in already-high-performing schools
    And identifies selective data presentation masking inequity
    And publishes fact-check revealing hidden disparities
