Scenario: Bioregional care economy networks reduce consumption through sharing
    Given many resources are underutilized in individual households
    And sharing reduces consumption while building care networks
    And bioregional resilience requires resource cooperation
    When bioregional_elohim facilitates resource sharing
    Then it should connect Robert to bioregional sharing networks
    And support participation in tool libraries, car sharing, and resource exchange
    And recognize that sharing reduces ecological impact and builds care economy
    And track ecological benefits of sharing: "Tool sharing prevented 8 redundant purchases"
    And demonstrate that care economy and ecological sustainability are aligned
    And build bioregional resilience through sharing economy
    And reduce consumption through care economy participation
