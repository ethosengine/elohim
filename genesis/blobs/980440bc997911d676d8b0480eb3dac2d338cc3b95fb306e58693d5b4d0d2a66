Scenario: Farm equipment investment decisions become democratically governed
    Given equipment purchases previously were Tom's sole decision
    And workers who use equipment daily had no input on purchases
    When democratic governance includes workers in equipment decisions
    Then farmworkers evaluate equipment options based on usability and safety
    And purchases prioritize worker wellbeing alongside productivity
    And equipment maintenance improves through worker ownership and care
    And investment decisions reflect users' expertise and long-term thinking
    And workplace_elohim facilitates democratic equipment planning and budgeting
