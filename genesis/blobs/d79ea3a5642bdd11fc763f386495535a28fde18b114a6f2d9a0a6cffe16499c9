Scenario: Water systems and food production understanding
    Given food production requires water resources
    And Marcus is learning about ecological systems
    When Marcus learns about food origins
    Then the personal_agent should teach about water in agriculture
    And it should explain water footprint of different foods
    And it should connect food choices to watershed health
    And bioregional water systems should be part of his literacy
    And he should understand water as precious resource
    And care economy should include stewardship of water
