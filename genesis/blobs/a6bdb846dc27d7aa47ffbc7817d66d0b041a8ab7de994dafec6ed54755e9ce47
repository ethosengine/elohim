Scenario: Politician navigates development pressure with environmental accountability
    Given developer proposes project with environmental impacts
    And campaign contributions create perception of conflict
    When the Observer documents environmental impacts and relationships
    Then they see project's environmental footprint objectively analyzed
    And identify developer's environmental track record
    And understand campaign finance relationships made publicly visible
    And review community environmental concerns systematically
    And make transparent decision accountable to environmental and community interests
