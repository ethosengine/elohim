Scenario: Learning about ecological carrying capacity and limits
    Given ecosystems have finite carrying capacity
    And consumption must stay within ecological limits
    When the personal_agent teaches environmental concepts
    Then it should explain ecological limits and boundaries
    And it should help her understand planetary boundaries
    And it should frame consumption within ecological context
    And she should learn that infinite growth is impossible
    And ecological literacy should include limits and constraints
