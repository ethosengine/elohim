Scenario: Maintaining family care relationships despite geographic distance
    Given Kenji lives 300 miles from family
    And he cannot provide daily in-person care or support
    When the family_elohim tracks Kenji's family contributions
    Then it should recognize remote emotional support as care work
    And it should value video calls with parents as connection labor
    And it should track time spent supporting younger siblings remotely
    And geographic distance should not make contributions invisible
    And the system should recognize digital care as real care
    And family connection across distance should be valued
