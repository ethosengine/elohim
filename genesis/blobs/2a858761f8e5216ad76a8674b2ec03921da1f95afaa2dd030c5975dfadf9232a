Scenario: Carbon sequestration through farming is measured and valued
    Given industrial agriculture is net carbon emitter through fossil inputs and soil degradation
    And regenerative agriculture sequesters carbon through soil building
    When democratic network values and compensates carbon sequestration
    Then soil carbon is measured showing annual sequestration increases
    And carbon sequestration is compensated through premium pricing or carbon credits
    And farm becomes climate solution, not climate problem
    And documented carbon impacts inform bioregional climate strategy
    And bioregional_elohim tracks carbon sequestration across democratic farm network
