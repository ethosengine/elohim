Scenario: Creator receives sustainable support from communities
    Given Jordan has consistently produced valuable climate education content
    And multiple educational communities appreciate the work
    When these communities decide to support Jordan's work
    Then they can contribute to Jordan's sustainability directly
    And support flows from communities who receive value
    And Jordan can continue creating without platform advertising
    And no surveillance or data extraction occurs
    And sustainable creator economy emerges from mutual value
