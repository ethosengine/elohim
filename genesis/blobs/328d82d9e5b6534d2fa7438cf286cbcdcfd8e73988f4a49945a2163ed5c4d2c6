Scenario: Concrete operations stage supports numerical comparison
    Given Emma can handle basic math at age 8
    And she is developing numerical reasoning
    When Emma compares prices or quantities
    Then the personal_agent should support mathematical thinking
    And the agent should ask "How much money would we save?"
    And simple calculations should be scaffolded
    And Emma should practice applying math to real decisions
    And numerical literacy should be built through authentic use
    And abstract concepts should be grounded in concrete comparisons
