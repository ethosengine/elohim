Scenario: Coordinate with county and state on cross-boundary issues
    Given Riverside is part of larger regional ecosystem
    And watershed management crosses municipal boundaries
    When Jamal works on water allocation issues
    Then he coordinates with upstream and downstream municipalities
    And Municipal Elohim shares data with regional agents
    And multi-municipal deliberative assembly convenes
    And solution serves multiple jurisdictions
    And municipal leaders demonstrate lateral coordination
    And subsidiarity enables appropriate-scale problem solving
