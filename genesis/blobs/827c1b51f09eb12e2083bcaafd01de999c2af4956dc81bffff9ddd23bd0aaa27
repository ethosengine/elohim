Feature: Municipal Governance for Elected Representative
  As a politician in the public_observer system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want to understand constituent needs and make informed decisions
  So that I can genuinely represent my community despite information asymmetry and capture pressures

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the politician user is registered in the system
    And the municipality governance context is active

  Scenario: Council member surfaces constituent intelligence at scale
    Given the politician represents 50,000 residents
    And only 20 constituents typically attend council meetings
    When the Observer aggregates constituent patterns from civic engagement
    Then the politician sees 230 families losing 90 minutes daily to bus delays
    And identifies senior centers underutilized due to access barriers
    And learns small businesses struggle with permit complexity
    And hears from working parents and shift workers who can't attend meetings
    And understands actual constituent needs beyond loudest voices

  Scenario: Mayor evaluates development proposal with comprehensive impact analysis
    Given a developer proposes mixed-use project with rosy projections
    And activists present worst-case scenarios in opposition
    When the politician requests Observer impact analysis
    Then they see developer's track record on past projects in other cities
    And review infrastructure capacity data (traffic, water, schools)
    And understand economic benefits distribution (jobs for whom, tax revenue timing)
    And identify community costs and trade-offs objectively
    And make informed decision beyond political calculations

  Scenario: Council member tracks accountability commitments systematically
    Given the politician made campaign promises to constituents
    And committed to specific actions in community meetings
    When the Observer monitors commitment tracking
    Then they receive alerts when deadlines approach
    And see status of all promises made across forums
    And get nudges to follow through on community pledges
    And build constituent trust through documented delivery
    And maintain integrity against overwhelming office demands

  Scenario: Council member distinguishes grassroots from astroturf campaign
    Given the politician receives flood of emails opposing rent control
    And campaigns look like authentic constituent concern
    When the Observer analyzes communication patterns
    Then they see template messages from industry lobbying firm
    And identify coordinated timing and identical language
    And distinguish 5 genuine constituent concerns from 200 manufactured messages
    And understand actual constituent sentiment versus manipulation
    And make decisions based on real community needs

  Scenario: Mayor builds coalition for affordable housing initiative
    Given the politician champions affordable housing policy
    And needs support from diverse stakeholders
    When the Observer surfaces coalition potential
    Then they see tenant organizations share policy interest
    And identify labor unions, faith communities, and senior advocates as allies
    And facilitate bringing stakeholders to table for policy design
    And track negotiation positions and evolution
    And build multi-stakeholder coalition for policy passage

  Scenario: Council member exposes budget priorities misaligned with constituent needs
    Given the politician suspects budget doesn't reflect community priorities
    When the Observer analyzes municipal spending patterns
    Then they see infrastructure investment concentrated in affluent neighborhoods
    And identify underinvestment in working-class areas
    And calculate service delivery disparities by district
    And present evidence-based budget amendments
    And advocate for equitable resource distribution

  Scenario: Mayor verifies lobbyist claims with independent evidence
    Given business lobbyists claim regulations will kill jobs
    And present alarming economic projections
    When the Observer fact-checks lobbying claims
    Then they see similar regulations in comparable cities
    And review actual economic impacts versus predicted disasters
    And identify which lobbyist projections proved accurate historically
    And evaluate claims against track record
    And resist manipulation through evidence-based analysis

  Scenario: Council member understands constituent priorities across diverse neighborhoods
    Given the politician represents economically and ethnically diverse district
    And different communities have different needs
    When the Observer aggregates constituent sentiment
    Then they see working parents prioritize after-school programs
    And learn seniors need meal delivery and transit access
    And understand immigrant communities face language barriers in services
    And identify disabled residents struggle with accessibility
    And balance diverse constituent needs in policy positions

  Scenario: Mayor monitors policy implementation against intended outcomes
    Given the politician voted for homelessness intervention program
    And expected specific outcomes from policy
    When the Observer tracks implementation
    Then they see which programs launched versus stalled
    And learn actual outcomes compared to projections
    And identify bureaucratic barriers to implementation
    And intervene to align execution with legislative intent
    And ensure votes translate to real community impact

  Scenario: Council member faces developer donation pressure with transparency
    Given the politician received campaign contributions from developers
    And developer seeks vote on controversial project
    When the Observer documents the relationship publicly
    Then they see their campaign finance connections made visible
    And understand constituents can track voting patterns
    And face accountability for aligning votes with donors versus community
    And navigate pressure with transparent decision-making
    And explain vote rationale with evidence regardless of decision
