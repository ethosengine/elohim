Scenario: Student labor contributions to educational institutions
    Given Kenji might do research work, TA work, or other academic labor
    And universities benefit from student labor beyond tuition
    When the educational_elohim tracks student labor
    Then it should recognize unpaid or underpaid student work for institution
    And it should help Kenji understand fair compensation for academic labor
    And it should accumulate care tokens for labor that benefits university
    And student labor should be recognized and fairly compensated
    And the system should help students identify labor exploitation
    And educational institutions should not extract uncompensated labor
