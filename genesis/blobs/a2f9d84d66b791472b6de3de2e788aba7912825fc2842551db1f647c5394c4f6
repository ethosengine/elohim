Scenario: Detecting when work demands destroy self-care capacity
    Given my personal_agent monitors my nutrition and rest patterns
    When my meal quality decreases for multiple consecutive days
    And my sleep falls below healthy minimums
    And I show signs of chronic exhaustion
    Then the protocol should surface a crisis alert
    And provide resources for immediate support
    And suggest workplace advocacy options
    And connect me to community care resources
