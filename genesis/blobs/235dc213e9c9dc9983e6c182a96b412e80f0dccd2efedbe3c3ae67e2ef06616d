Scenario: Operator achieves financial security without requiring worker exploitation
    Given franchise profitability required suppressing wages and pushing workers harder
    And James hated exploiting workers but saw no alternative within franchise structure
    When conversion provides acquisition payment liberating him financially
    Then $150K return plus consulting income provides foundation for next chapter
    And financial security came through fair value recognition, not worker exploitation
    And false choice between operator security and worker dignity is resolved
    And ethical path to personal financial stability becomes real
    And workplace_elohim documents that exploitation is not necessary for operator security
