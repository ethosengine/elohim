Scenario: Advocating for children's educational needs when institutional responses are inadequate
    Given school is not providing appropriate support for my children
    And I need to advocate more forcefully for services
    When school fails to meet children's educational needs
    Then the Value Scanner helps me understand escalation options
    And provides resources on children's educational rights
    And connects me to educational advocacy organizations
    And helps me document inadequate services for advocacy purposes
    And my personal_agent drafts advocacy communications
    And recognizes forceful advocacy as necessary parenting work
    And validates that schools should serve all children appropriately
    And supports me in demanding what my children deserve
