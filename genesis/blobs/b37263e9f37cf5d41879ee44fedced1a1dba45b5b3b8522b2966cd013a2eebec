Scenario: Fair distribution of household labor among roommates
    Given Kenji does most cooking but little cleaning
    And roommates have different strengths and available time
    When the household_elohim tracks all household labor
    Then it should measure cooking, cleaning, shopping, maintenance, and organizing
    And it should show each roommate's contribution: "Kenji: 18hrs, Maya: 6hrs, Sam: 8hrs, Jordan: 4hrs"
    And it should surface imbalances explicitly
    And it should facilitate conversation about fair redistribution
    And the system should prevent exploitation through visibility
    And household equity should be measurable and adjustable
