    And they will increasingly need to care for each other
    When the household_elohim tracks household care patterns
    Then it should recognize reciprocal care between partners
    And it should show how they support each other's well-being
    And it should value care they provide to each other
    And household care economy should include partner care
    And both should accumulate care tokens for caring for each other
    And the system should support their aging together with dignity
