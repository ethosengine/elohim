Scenario: Accessing community resources as independent adult
    Given Aisha is now an independent adult community member
    And community resources are available based on contribution
    When Aisha accesses community care economy resources
    Then the community_elohim should recognize her adult status
    And she should access resources based on care contributions
    And her participation should be tracked at community level
    And she should have different access than dependent children
    And the system should treat her as autonomous adult participant
    And community resources should support her independence
