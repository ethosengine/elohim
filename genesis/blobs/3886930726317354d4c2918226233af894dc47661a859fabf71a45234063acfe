Scenario: Financial constraint management without stigma
    Given Helen's fixed income is $24k/year
    And this is severe resource constraint
    When Helen uses the Value Scanner for purchasing decisions
    Then the system should help her navigate financial limits
    And budget assistance should be provided with dignity
    And no shame should be attached to limited resources
    And community care economy connections should be surfaced
    And food assistance should be presented as legitimate reciprocity
    And her lifetime of contributions should create valid claims on support
    And assistance should flow with respect, not charity
