Scenario: My judgment influences national legislation
    Given Senator Ruiz drafts national AI governance legislation
    And she cites our national council precedents
    When my constitutional reasoning shapes democratic law
    Then my nurse-mother perspective: enriches national policy
    And my citizen judgment: guides representative government
    And sortition and elected democracy: work as partners
    And my unlikely voice: matters at highest levels of governance
    And I understand: democratic participation as transformation
    And I have become: constitutional architect for my nation
    And I know: ordinary people can govern extraordinary complexity
