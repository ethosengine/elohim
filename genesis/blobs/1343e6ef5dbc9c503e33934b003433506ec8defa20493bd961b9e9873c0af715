Scenario: Extended family support coordination with maintained boundaries
    Given Maria may receive support from her own parents or siblings
    And extended family help can be complicated by distance or family dynamics
    When extended family contributes to children's care
    Then the family_elohim should track and coordinate extended family involvement
    And it should help Maria maintain boundaries around parenting authority
    And it should recognize extended family contributions without ceding control
    And it should prevent grandparents or others from overstepping
    And Maria should retain parental sovereignty while accepting help
