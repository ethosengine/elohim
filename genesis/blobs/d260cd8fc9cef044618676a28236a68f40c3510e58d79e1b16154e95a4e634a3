Scenario: Crisis coordination across municipal infrastructure
    Given opioid overdose cluster occurs in downtown
    When Municipal Elohim detects crisis pattern
    Then agent coordinates emergency services, health services, and social support
    And agent identifies who needs help across multiple systems
    And agent enables rapid mutual aid mobilization
    And Jamal maintains human judgment for crisis decisions
    And agents inform while humans decide under uncertainty
    And coordinated response saves lives
