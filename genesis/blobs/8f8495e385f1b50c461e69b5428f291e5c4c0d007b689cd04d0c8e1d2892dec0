Scenario: Making household contributions visible
    Given I contribute to household care when my schedule allows
    Including shopping, cooking, cleaning, and bills management
    When household members want to understand contribution distribution
    Then the protocol should make all care work visible
    And show my contributions relative to available time
    And recognize that my irregular schedule affects participation
    And facilitate fair distribution accounting for work constraints
