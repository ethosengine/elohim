Scenario: Tracking changing nutritional needs for health management
    Given Margaret is managing early-stage diabetes
    And she needs more protein and calcium, less sodium
    And medications affect her appetite and digestion
    When Margaret shops for groceries
    Then her personal_agent should track nutrition across time
    And it should suggest foods appropriate for her health conditions
    And it should flag items high in sodium or sugar
    And it should highlight protein and calcium-rich options
    And it should help her balance health needs with budget constraints
    And nutritional guidance should feel supportive, not controlling
    And Margaret should maintain agency over food choices
