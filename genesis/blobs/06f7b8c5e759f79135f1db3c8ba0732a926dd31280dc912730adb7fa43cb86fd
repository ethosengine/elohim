Scenario: Workers demonstrate transparency building community trust
    Given community members want to understand democratic business model
    And workers value transparency about operations and values
    When workers publish quarterly community impact report
    Then report shows wages paid to workers ($72K quarterly)
    And report documents community programs funded ($3K senior meals)
    And report shares environmental benefits (1,200 lbs local produce)
    And report includes challenges and learnings honestly
    And community_elohim makes report accessible and understandable
    And transparency builds community trust and support
