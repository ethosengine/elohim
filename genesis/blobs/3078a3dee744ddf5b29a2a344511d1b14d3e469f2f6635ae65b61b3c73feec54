Scenario: Activist fights for paid sick leave policy
    Given workers lack basic workplace protections
    And the activist campaigns for paid sick leave ordinance
    When the Observer shows public health and economic impacts
    Then the activist demonstrates workers go to work sick
    And spread illness because they can't afford to stay home
    And public health costs of no sick leave
    And presents evidence from cities with successful sick leave policies
    And worker protection becomes public health imperative
