Scenario: Sharing implementation wisdom with other community leaders
    Given I have three years experience implementing protocol in Riverside
    And other mayors considering adoption seek my advice
    When I share honest assessment of benefits and challenges
    Then I describe: what worked (community calibration, Constitutional Council)
    And I acknowledge: what struggled (elderly accessibility, some controversy)
    And I explain: factors predicting success (community buy-in, resources, patience)
    And I provide: practical implementation guidance
    And I offer: not utopia but better than what we had
    And I emphasize: communities control adoption speed and approach
    And peer network: enables learning across communities
