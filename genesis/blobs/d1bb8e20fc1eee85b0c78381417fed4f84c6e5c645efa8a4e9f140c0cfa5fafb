Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Preteen
  As a preteen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to contribute to and benefit from neighborhood-scale coordination
  So that my family's needs are met through reciprocal care networks and local resource sharing

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the preteen user "Marcus" is registered in the system
    And Marcus's family participates in neighborhood care economy
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim is coordinating local care patterns
    And Marcus shops at stores within his neighborhood

  Scenario: Shopping patterns contribute to neighborhood food access insights
    Given Marcus shops regularly at neighborhood stores
    And he tracks prices and availability across locations
    When Marcus's anonymized shopping data is aggregated
    Then it should contribute to neighborhood food access mapping
    And the neighborhood_elohim should identify food deserts
    And pricing patterns should be visible at neighborhood scale
    And Marcus's data should help others navigate local food systems
    And collective knowledge should reduce individual burden
    And his contributions should improve neighborhood food security

  Scenario: Neighborhood food cooperative formation includes preteen family
    Given a food cooperative is forming in Marcus's neighborhood
    And cooperative buying could reduce his family's grocery costs
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies the opportunity
    Then Marcus's family should be informed about the cooperative
    And the notification should say "A food cooperative is forming—your participation would strengthen it"
    And Marcus's care contributions should qualify family for membership
    And cooperative participation should reduce his budget constraints
    And neighborhood coordination should reduce individual family burden
    And Marcus should learn that collective action creates better outcomes

  Scenario: Local store relationships built through consistent presence
    Given Marcus shops weekly at neighborhood stores
    And he is a regular, recognizable customer
    When Marcus builds relationships with store workers
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate positive recognition
    And store workers should see Marcus's care contributions
    And they should understand he's feeding his family, not just shopping
    And informal support networks should develop
    And local relationships should provide informal safety net
    And Marcus should be known and looked after in his neighborhood

  Scenario: Neighborhood mutual aid networks recognize preteen contributions
    Given Marcus's family both needs and provides care
    And neighborhood mutual aid operates on reciprocity
    When neighborhood care networks are coordinated
    Then Marcus's household labor should be visible to mutual aid networks
    And his contributions should qualify family for receiving support
    And the framing should be reciprocal care, not charity
    And Marcus gives care (household management); community gives care (support)
    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate these exchanges
    And dignity should be preserved through reciprocity framework

  Scenario: Multi-store price comparison supports budget optimization
    Given Marcus has limited budget and multiple store options
    And different stores have different prices for same items
    When Marcus plans his shopping across stores
    Then the personal_agent should provide multi-store price comparison
    And it should aggregate data from neighborhood stores
    And it should optimize shopping list across locations
    And it should help Marcus get best value from his $75 budget
    And neighborhood-scale data should reduce his individual burden
    And collective price intelligence should benefit all families

  Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces household costs
    Given many families have similar needs
    And resource sharing could reduce individual costs
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies sharing opportunities
    Then Marcus's family should be connected to sharing networks
    And bulk buying cooperatives should be suggested
    And tool libraries and resource sharing should be facilitated
    And neighborhood coordination should stretch Marcus's budget further
    And collective consumption should reduce individual scarcity
    And care economy should operate at neighborhood scale

  Scenario: Safety through neighborhood awareness and care
    Given Marcus is a 12-year-old shopping independently
    And neighborhood safety is important for his autonomy
    When Marcus moves through his neighborhood
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate informal care networks
    And local adults should be aware of children shopping independently
    And community care should provide informal oversight
    And Marcus should be safer through neighborhood relationships
    And his independence should be supported by community awareness
    And the protocol should build village-scale child protection

  Scenario: Identifying food waste reduction opportunities at neighborhood scale
    Given Marcus must maximize value from limited budget
    And food waste represents lost resources
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies waste patterns
    Then it should connect Marcus to gleaning opportunities
    And it should facilitate food rescue programs
    And it should help him access surplus food from stores
    And neighborhood coordination should reduce waste while addressing need
    And Marcus's family should benefit from systematic waste reduction
    And ecological and economic goals should align

  Scenario: Seasonal and local food availability at neighborhood level
    Given Marcus shops in specific geographic area
    And seasonal local food is often cheaper
    When Marcus plans meals
    Then the personal_agent should highlight seasonal local options
    And it should show what's available from neighborhood sources
    And it should help him find affordable local produce
    And neighborhood farmers' markets should be integrated
    And local food systems should benefit Marcus's budget
    And bioregional awareness should develop through practice

  Scenario: Neighborhood solidarity in resource scarcity
    Given Marcus's family faces economic constraints
    And other neighborhood families have similar struggles
    When neighborhood care patterns are visible
    Then Marcus should understand his family is not alone
    And collective challenges should be visible at neighborhood scale
    And solidarity should develop among families facing scarcity
    And the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate mutual support
    And isolation should be reduced through shared understanding
    And political consciousness about systemic issues should begin to form

  Scenario: Privacy preserved while participating in neighborhood networks
    Given Marcus's household circumstances are sensitive
    And participation in neighborhood networks requires some visibility
    When Marcus's data contributes to neighborhood coordination
    Then his specific situation must remain private
    And only anonymized aggregate data should be used
    And neighborhood support should flow without stigmatizing exposure
    And his dignity should be protected while receiving benefits
    And privacy should be balanced with community participation
    And the protocol should enable solidarity without surveillance
