Scenario: Successful franchise conversion demonstrates sector-wide alternative to extraction
    Given franchise model dominates food service through extraction and control
    And industry assumes extraction is necessary for operational efficiency
    When James's conversions prove democratic operation outperforms franchise
    Then food service sector sees concrete evidence of viable alternative
    And higher worker wages, better quality, and lower prices coexist through eliminating extraction
    And industry narrative shifts from "franchise is only scalable model" to "democratic is superior"
    And other franchise operators observe and consider conversion
    And industry_sector_elohim documents superior performance metrics for advocacy
