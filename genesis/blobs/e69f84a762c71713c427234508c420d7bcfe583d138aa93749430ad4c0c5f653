Given protocol affects work and value recognition
And care work generates care tokens
When I update labor law for protocol economy
Then I clarify: status of care tokens vs traditional wages
And I address: worker protections in protocol-mediated work
And I ensure: fair labor standards apply
And I update: social insurance for protocol participants
And I protect: workers while enabling innovation
And law adapts: to new forms of value creation
