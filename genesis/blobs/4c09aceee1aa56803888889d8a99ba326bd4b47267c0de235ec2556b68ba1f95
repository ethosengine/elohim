Scenario: Volunteer work recognized as valuable care economy contribution
    Given Margaret volunteers 10 hours/week in community
    And she serves at food bank, library, or community health clinic
    When the community_elohim tracks volunteer contributions
    Then it should quantify Margaret's volunteer hours
    And it should calculate economic value of her skilled labor
    And it should accumulate care tokens for community service
    And volunteer work should be recognized as substantial contribution
    And Margaret should see herself as productive community member
    And retirement should be liberation for care work, not obsolescence
    And community should value and appreciate her service
