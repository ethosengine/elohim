Scenario: Care leave policies advocated based on personal experience
    Given Robert has navigated inadequate care leave policies
    And he knows what workplace support caregivers need
    And his leadership position enables policy advocacy
    When workplace_elohim supports policy advocacy
    Then it should help Robert advocate for expanded care leave
    And provide evidence about care leave benefits for retention and productivity
    And connect him to policy development processes
    And support him in proposing paid family leave, elder care leave, and flexible care arrangements
    And build workplace policy that supports employees' care responsibilities
    And leverage his experience and standing for systemic improvement
    And demonstrate that middle managers can drive workplace transformation
