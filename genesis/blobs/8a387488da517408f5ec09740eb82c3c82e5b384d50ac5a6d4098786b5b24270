Scenario: Personal capacity limits respected and enforced
    Given Sarah has finite energy, time, and emotional capacity
    And demands regularly exceed her available resources
    When Sarah approaches capacity limits
    Then the personal_agent should help her identify what to drop
    And it should validate saying no to non-essential demands
    And it should recognize that she cannot do everything
    And capacity constraints should be treated as real boundaries
    And the system should support sustainable pacing
    And Sarah should learn that limitations are human, not failure
