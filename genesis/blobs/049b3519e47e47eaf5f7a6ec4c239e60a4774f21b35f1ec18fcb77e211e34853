Scenario: Appeal involving adolescent autonomy within family
    Given I am a teenager whose Family Elohim restricted my social media use
    And I believe this violates my developing autonomy
    And my parents supported the agent's decision
    When I file an appeal for my individual autonomy rights
    Then the Constitutional Council considers "developing autonomy" as constitutional value
    And They balance parental care responsibility with adolescent independence
    And They evaluate if the restriction was proportionate to actual risk
    And They consider age-appropriate autonomy recognition
    And The appeal may establish family-specific boundaries for future interventions
    And My voice is heard even within family authority structures
