Scenario: Community care economy demonstrates alternative to extraction economics
    Given Sarah's community has adopted care economy practices
    And mainstream economics devalue care work
    When community care economy becomes visible
    Then it should demonstrate that alternatives to capitalism are viable
    And it should show care work creates real value
    And it should inspire other communities to adopt similar practices
    And Sarah's community should serve as model
    And care economy transformation should spread through demonstrated success
