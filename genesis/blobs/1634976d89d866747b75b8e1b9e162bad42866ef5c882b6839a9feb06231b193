Scenario: Customer consumption aligns with values through democratic option
    Given Ms. Johnson opposed worker exploitation but lacked alternatives
    And corporate greenwashing made ethical consumption impossible to verify
    When democratic business provides transparent ethical alternative
    Then her consumption supports values: worker dignity, fair wages, environmental stewardship, community wealth
    And alignment between values and consumption reduces moral cognitive dissonance
    And she feels good about supporting democratic business, not guilty about corporate extraction
    And ethical consumption becomes real choice, not marketing manipulation
    And community_elohim helps communicate values alignment opportunities
