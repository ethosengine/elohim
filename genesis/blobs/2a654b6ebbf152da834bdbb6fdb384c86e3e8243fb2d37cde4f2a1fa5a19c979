Scenario: Board member learns accessible expertise on complex water infrastructure decision
    Given water district faces decision on $50M infrastructure upgrade
    And engineering staff presentation uses technical jargon and assumptions
    And board member has no engineering background but must vote responsibly
    When the board member uses Observer to understand the decision
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of technical trade-offs
    And see comparison of infrastructure approaches used by similar districts
    And access key questions to ask staff about cost estimates and alternatives
    And get context on long-term maintenance and rate impacts
    And accessible expertise enables informed decision without full-time study
