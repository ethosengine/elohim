Scenario: Understanding labor rights as student worker
    Given Kenji has same labor rights as any employee
    And many students don't know their workplace rights
    When the workplace_elohim educates Kenji about labor law
    Then it should teach him about breaks, overtime, workplace safety
    And it should inform him of right to organize and unionize
    And it should help him recognize illegal employer practices
    And it should empower him to advocate for fair treatment
    And the system should build Kenji's labor rights literacy
    And student workers should know and exercise their rights
