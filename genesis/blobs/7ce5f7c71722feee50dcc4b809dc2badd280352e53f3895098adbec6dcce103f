Scenario: Individual flourishing metrics beyond caregiving productivity
    Given Sarah's value extends far beyond care productivity
    And she is a complete person deserving of flourishing
    When the system measures Sarah's well-being
    Then it should track her joy, rest, creative expression, and growth
    And it should measure whether she's experiencing life beyond caregiving
    And it should flag if she has no non-caregiving identity markers
    And individual flourishing should be valued as essential
    And Sarah should be supported in being whole, not just productive
    And the care economy should enable her complete humanity
