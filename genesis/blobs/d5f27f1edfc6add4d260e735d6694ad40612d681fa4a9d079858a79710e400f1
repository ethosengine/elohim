Scenario: Transitioning from provider to receiver in family care economy
    Given Frank has been primary provider throughout his working life
    And he's now transitioning to more mutual reciprocity
    And he'll eventually need more care than he provides
    When family_elohim tracks the transition
    Then it should recognize Frank continues substantial provision
    And it should help him accept receiving care without shame
    And it should show adult children how to reciprocate care
    And Frank's lifetime of provision should create legitimate claims
    And the transition should preserve his dignity and agency
    And family should prepare for his increasing future needs
    And care reciprocity across lifecycle should be normalized
