Scenario: Maintaining neighborhood relationships across class differences
    Given Margaret has limited income but middle-class background
    And the neighborhood may have economic diversity
    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates connections
    Then Margaret should be connected across economic boundaries
    And her value should not depend on financial resources
    And care contributions should create cross-class solidarity
    And the neighborhood should value all members' contributions
    And economic diversity should strengthen rather than divide
    And Margaret's care economy participation should bridge differences
