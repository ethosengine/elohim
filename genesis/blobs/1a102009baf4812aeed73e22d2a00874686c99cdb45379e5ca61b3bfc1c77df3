Scenario: Senior-to-senior support and community building
    Given Margaret is in "younger" senior cohort (65-74)
    And older seniors (75+) need support and connection
    When the community_elohim coordinates senior support
    Then Margaret should be part of senior mutual aid networks
    And her peer support should be recognized as care contribution
    And senior-to-senior care should prevent isolation
    And age-matched support should be valued alongside intergenerational
    And senior community should be strengthened through care economy
    And Margaret should build relationships with peers
