Scenario: Participating in neighborhood mutual aid despite time limits
    Given my neighborhood has mutual aid networks
    And I have minimal time due to work demands
    When I want to participate in neighborhood care economy
    Then the protocol should identify micro-opportunities for contribution
    And help me participate in ways that fit my schedule
    And recognize that small contributions matter
    And connect me to neighborhood resources when I need support
