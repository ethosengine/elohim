Scenario: Elder preserves bioregional knowledge across displacement
    Given community elders hold traditional knowledge of coastal ecology
    And this knowledge is being lost as the community displaces
    When elders document traditional knowledge through the network
    And younger displaced community members learn and preserve it
    Then bioregional ecological knowledge is preserved
    And the knowledge can inform restoration efforts
    And future generations maintain connection to ancestral place
    And cultural-ecological wisdom survives displacement
