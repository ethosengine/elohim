Scenario: Teacher exposes state curriculum standards implementation gap
    Given state adopted new curriculum standards three years ago
    But provided no implementation funding or professional development
    When teachers document implementation reality through Observer
    Then statewide data shows 68% of teachers lack standards-aligned materials
    And 71% received no professional development on new standards
    And student assessment results reflect implementation failure
    And teachers coordinate testimony to state education committee
    And policy implementation accountability emerges from teacher evidence
