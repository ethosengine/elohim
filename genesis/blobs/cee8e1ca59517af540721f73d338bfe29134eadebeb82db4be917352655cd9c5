Scenario: Recognizing when workplace demands become unsustainable
    Given Aisha faces intense workplace expectations
    And she often works long hours
    When the personal_agent monitors her workplace patterns
    Then it should flag when demands are unsustainable
    And it should recognize that she's worked through lunch repeatedly
    And it should identify when work-life balance is failing
    And the system should help her see overwork clearly
    And she should be supported in setting boundaries
    And workplace care economy should prevent exploitation
