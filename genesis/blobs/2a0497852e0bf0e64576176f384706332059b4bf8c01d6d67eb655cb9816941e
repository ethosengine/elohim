Scenario: Local financial institutions develop lending products for democratic conversions
    Given banks lack experience financing worker ownership transitions
    And conversion financing barriers limit democratic economy growth
    When Rosa's successful conversion demonstrates creditworthiness of democratic model
    Then local banks and credit unions develop conversion lending products
    And community development financial institutions (CDFIs) prioritize democratic business
    And municipal policy supports conversion lending through guarantees or partnerships
    And financial infrastructure emerges for scaling democratic conversions citywide
    And municipality_elohim coordinates with financial institutions on product development
