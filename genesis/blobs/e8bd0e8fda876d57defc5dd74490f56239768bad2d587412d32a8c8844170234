Scenario: Organizer documents environmental justice disparities for campaign
    Given industrial pollution concentrates in low-income neighborhoods of color
    While parks and trees concentrate in wealthy white areas
    When the Observer provides environmental equity data
    Then the organizer sees pollution sources mapped by neighborhood demographics
    And views park access and tree canopy distribution
    And calculates health impact disparities from environmental conditions
    And identifies affected communities for organizing base
    And environmental racism becomes documented and actionable
