Scenario: Comparative methodology testing different governance models
    Given I want to compare sortition councils to alternative governance approaches
    And some regions use elected representatives, others expert panels, others algorithms
    When I conduct systematic comparison across governance models
    Then I examine: decision quality (outcomes, constitutional alignment, legitimacy)
    And I assess: participation (who governs, how accessible, how diverse)
    And I measure: trust (public confidence in decisions)
    And I analyze: adaptability (responding to new challenges)
    And I compare: costs (resources required vs benefits delivered)
    And I provide: evidence about relative strengths of different models
    And My research serves: democratic choice among governance alternatives
