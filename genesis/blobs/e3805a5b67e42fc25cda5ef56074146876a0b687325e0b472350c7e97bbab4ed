Scenario: Community networks provide backup support for care crises
    Given Robert manages complex care demands that could face crisis
    And care crises happen: parent hospitalization, child emergency, personal illness
    And community networks could provide emergency support
    When community_elohim builds crisis resilience
    Then it should connect Robert to community members who could help in crisis
    And identify backup support for his various care responsibilities
    And ensure he's not isolated when crisis hits
    And recognize that his care contributions create reciprocal crisis support
    And build community resilience through mutual aid networks
    And demonstrate that care economy participation provides safety net
    And prevent care crisis from becoming catastrophic
