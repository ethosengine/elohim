Scenario: Customer spending circulates wealth in neighborhood economy
    Given Ms. Johnson spends $900 annually at democratic ChickenMax/Maria's Kitchen
    And multiply her spending by hundreds of neighborhood customers
    When democratic ownership ensures value circulates locally instead of extracting
    Then $540 of her spending goes to workers who spend in neighborhood
    And $270 supports community programs benefiting neighbors
    And $90 funds environmental stewardship protecting local health
    And aggregate customer spending ($200K+ annually from regulars) massively benefits community
    And community_elohim documents wealth circulation vs. previous corporate extraction
