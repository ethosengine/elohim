Scenario: Preventing Sarah's burnout through family care coordination
    Given Sarah is at high risk for caregiver burnout
    And she tends to sacrifice herself for family needs
    When the family_elohim monitors care patterns
    Then it should detect when Sarah is giving unsustainably
    And it should surface imbalances before crisis
    And it should prompt other family members to contribute more
    And it should connect Sarah to family support resources
    And the protocol should protect Sarah's capacity to care
