Scenario: Visibility of aggregate retired resident contributions transforms perception
    Given Frank is one of many retired residents contributing substantial volunteer labor
    And aggregate impact is significant but invisible in traditional metrics
    When the community_elohim surfaces aggregate data
    Then it should quantify total volunteer labor from retired residents
    And calculate combined market value (potentially millions annually)
    And demonstrate that retired residents are massive community asset
    And counter narrative of elders as economic burden
    And transform community understanding of retirement contributions
    And support policy that recognizes and values retired resident participation
    And Frank should see himself as part of powerful community infrastructure
