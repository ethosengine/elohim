Scenario: Parent tracks implementation of new safety policies
    Given the school board passed new student safety protocols
    And promised implementation at all schools by September
    When September arrives and the parent's school lacks the protocols
    Then the Observer alerts parent about implementation failure
    And shows which schools have implemented vs which haven't
    And reveals pattern of under-resourced schools being deprioritized
    And parent can demand accountability for child safety commitments
    And policy passage doesn't mean policy implementation without tracking
