Scenario: Neighborhood mutual aid networks include Alex as full participant
    Given Alex participates in neighborhood mutual aid
    And Alex both gives and receives support
    When neighborhood care flows are tracked
    Then Alex should be recognized as mutual aid contributor
    And Alex provides support to neighbors (advice, connection, skills)
    And Alex receives support from neighbors (physical assistance, rides, help)
    And reciprocity should be visible and valued
    And the neighborhood_elohim should track care flows in multiple directions
    And Alex should experience genuine mutuality, not charity
    And interdependence should be normalized as neighborhood practice
