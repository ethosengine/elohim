Scenario: Participating in community mutual aid networks
    Given community has mutual aid networks for resources, skills, childcare, support
    And mutual aid operates on reciprocity and solidarity
    When I engage with community mutual aid
    Then the Value Scanner connects me to local mutual aid networks
    And facilitates both my receiving and my contributing
    And tracks mutual aid participation with care tokens
    And helps me navigate mutual aid culture and expectations
    And validates that mutual aid is community care, not individual charity
    And my personal_agent coordinates my mutual aid relationships
    And recognizes mutual aid as alternative to degrading institutional charity
    And supports genuine reciprocity and collective care
