Scenario: Workers share facility space for community organizing after hours
    Given ChickenMax dining space sits empty evenings and weekends
    And community groups need meeting space
    When community requests use of space for organizing meetings
    Then workers democratically decide to share space with community groups
    And workers establish guidelines for community space use
    And workers charge minimal fee to cover utilities
    And community groups organize tenants' rights, immigrant support, etc.
    And business becomes community hub beyond meal service
