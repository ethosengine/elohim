Scenario: Evaluating whether employment genuinely supports or undermines stability-building
    Given some employment could undermine rather than support my rebuilding
    And I need work that enables rather than prevents stability
    When I evaluate employment opportunities holistically
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me assess total impact of employment
    And considers financial benefit, schedule compatibility, stress level, childcare impact, recovery support
    And validates that employment should improve my situation, not worsen it
    And helps me identify when employment costs more (financially, emotionally, practically) than it provides
    And my personal_agent evaluates opportunities against my whole situation
    And recognizes that not all employment serves vulnerable people
    And supports me declining employment that would harm my rebuilding
