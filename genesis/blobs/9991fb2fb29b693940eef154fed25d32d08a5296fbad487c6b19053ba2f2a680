Scenario: Journalist investigates state criminal justice disparities
    Given the journalist covers criminal justice policy
    And data suggests racial disparities in enforcement
    When the Observer analyzes statewide criminal justice data
    Then the journalist sees Black residents arrested at 4x rate for same offenses
    And documents sentencing disparities for similar crimes
    And tracks outcomes showing selective enforcement patterns
    And identifies counties with extreme disparities
    And publishes investigation exposing systemic racism
    And pattern recognition reveals injustice at scale
