Scenario: Participating in global constitutional convention as observer
    Given Global Constitutional Convention convenes with 10,000 delegates
    And I attend as policy maker observer not delegate
    When I observe global deliberative democracy
    Then I learn: from how diverse humanity deliberates together
    And I see: what enables agreement despite profound disagreement
    And I witness: ordinary citizens governing existential questions
    And I prepare: to implement constitutional amendments in my nation
    And I translate: global constitutional evolution into national law
    And I am humbled: by wisdom of randomly-selected citizens
    And I understand: my role as servant of democratic will
