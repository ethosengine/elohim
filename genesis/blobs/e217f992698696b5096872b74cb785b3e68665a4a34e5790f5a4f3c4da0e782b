Scenario: Documenting community care contributions for future recognition
    Given Kenji's community care work is currently invisible to traditional economy
    And his care tokens accumulate throughout college
    When Kenji graduates and enters workforce
    Then his care token history should document community leadership and care skills
    And it should translate community organizing to "proven leadership capability"
    And it should show mutual aid coordination as "project management expertise"
    And community care work should be valuable on employment terms
    And the system should help Kenji articulate care economy participation professionally
    And student community work should be recognized as career-relevant experience
