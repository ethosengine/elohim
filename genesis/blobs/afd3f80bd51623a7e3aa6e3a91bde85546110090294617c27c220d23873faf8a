Scenario: Workers coordinate political advocacy for democratic business policies
    Given municipal government is considering economic development policies
    And workers want policies supporting democratic ownership
    When sector workers organize advocacy campaign
    Then workers from multiple EAE entities testify at city council
    And workers present data on democratic business benefits
    And workers advocate for procurement preferences and tax incentives
    And coordinated worker voice influences policy more than isolated entities
    And sector political power protects and expands democratic economy
