Scenario: Student recognized as real neighborhood member despite temporary status
    Given Kenji will likely move after graduation
    And neighborhoods often treat students as temporary non-members
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks neighborhood participation
    Then it should recognize students as current, real residents
    And it should value Kenji's presence now, not discount it as temporary
    And it should include him in neighborhood decision-making
    And temporary residency should not exclude from community membership
    And the system should counteract student marginalization
    And Kenji should experience genuine neighborhood belonging
