Scenario: Managing real scarcity without shame or stigma
    Given Marcus's family has limited economic resources
    And $75/week must feed two people adequately
    When Marcus shops under tight budget constraints
    Then the personal_agent should help him maximize value with dignity
    And budget tools should be presented as capability support, not poverty markers
    And the system should never make him feel ashamed of constraints
    And resourcefulness should be framed as valuable skill, not deprivation
    And his capability to manage scarcity should be recognized as sophisticated
    And no patronizing language about "limited budgets" should be used
