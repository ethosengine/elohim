Scenario: Preventing exploitation of grandparent care labor
    Given Margaret provides substantial unpaid care
    And she could potentially be taken advantage of
    When the family_elohim monitors care economy equity
    Then it should flag if Margaret's contributions are excessive relative to reciprocity
    And it should prevent family from treating her as "free childcare"
    And it should ensure her care work is appreciated and valued
    And it should help family recognize when to compensate or reciprocate
    And Margaret should have standing to set boundaries
    And care economy should protect grandparents from exploitation
    And family relationships should be equitable, not extractive
