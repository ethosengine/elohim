Scenario: Community care economy prevents teen labor exploitation
    Given Jasmine works part-time in retail
    And young workers are vulnerable to exploitation
    When her workplace conditions are monitored through community care economy
    Then the community_elohim should track whether her labor is fairly compensated
    And flag if work hours interfere with education or development
    And recognize if workplace conditions become exploitative
    And surface resources about worker rights and fair labor practices
    And provide community support if she faces workplace problems
    And demonstrate that care economy extends to protecting young workers
