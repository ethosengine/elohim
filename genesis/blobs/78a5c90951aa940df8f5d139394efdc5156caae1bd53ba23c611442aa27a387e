Scenario: Managing fixed income with dignity and sophistication
    Given Margaret has a $150/week grocery budget
    And her income is fixed and cannot be increased through employment
    When Margaret plans her shopping
    Then her personal_agent should provide sophisticated budgeting tools
    And it should identify sales and optimize value per dollar
    And it should track spending across weeks for pattern analysis
    And it should suggest resource optimization without stigma
    And it should help her maintain quality of life within constraints
    And the framing should be dignity-preserving, not scarcity-shaming
    And Margaret should experience agency, not deprivation
