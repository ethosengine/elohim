Scenario: Solo household labor tracking shows work of two parents
    Given Maria performs all household labor alone
    And she does cooking, cleaning, laundry, maintenance, logistics, planning
    When household labor is tracked
    Then the household_elohim should quantify all of Maria's work
    And it should make visible that she's doing work normally split between two adults
    And tracking should validate that solo parenting is literally double the labor
    And Maria's care token accumulation should reflect superhuman household contribution
    And society should see quantified proof of single parents' extraordinary work
