Scenario: Quantifying grandparent care contributions at individual level
    Given Margaret provides 25 hours/week of active childcare
    And market rate for professional childcare is ~$1,500/month
    When the personal_agent tracks Margaret's care labor
    Then it should quantify all hours spent in active childcare
    And it should calculate economic value of her contributions
    And it should accumulate care tokens for her labor
    And it should recognize developmental benefits beyond market value
    And Margaret should see that her work is substantial and valuable
    And the data should counter narrative of "just spending time with grandkids"
    And her contributions should be visible and quantified
