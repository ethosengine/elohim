Scenario: Neighborhood privacy balanced with coordination needs
    Given neighborhood care economy requires some data sharing
    And Sarah values her household privacy
    When Sarah participates in neighborhood coordination
    Then she should control what information neighbors see
    And household details should remain private unless shared
    And the neighborhood_elohim should only share aggregated patterns
    And Sarah's privacy should be protected while enabling coordination
    And participation should not require sacrificing privacy
