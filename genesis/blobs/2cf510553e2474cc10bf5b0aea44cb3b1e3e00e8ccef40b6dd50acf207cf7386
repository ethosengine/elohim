Scenario: Farmworker recruitment and retention improve through ownership opportunity
    Given agricultural labor traditionally has high turnover due to low pay and poor conditions
    And farm struggled to retain skilled workers who left for better opportunities
    When democratic ownership offers farmworkers equity stake and voice
    Then recruitment improves as workers seek dignified agricultural employment
    And retention increases dramatically (90%+ vs. previous 40% annual retention)
    And institutional expertise accumulates through stable workforce
    And farm benefits from long-term worker commitment and skill development
