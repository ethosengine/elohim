Scenario: Workplace acknowledges single parents have no backup for emergencies
    Given Maria has no co-parent to handle child illness, school emergencies, or family crises
    And she must handle every emergency alone while maintaining employment
    When workplace policies address family emergencies
    Then the workplace_elohim should make visible that single parents have no backup
    And policies should recognize emergencies are inevitable and not optional
    And Maria should be able to handle crises without job security risk
    And single parent realities should inform workplace family leave policies
    And employers should understand solo parents cannot simply "find coverage" at home
