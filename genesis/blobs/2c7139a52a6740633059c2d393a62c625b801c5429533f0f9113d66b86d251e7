Scenario: Seasonal eating aligned with bioregional food production
    Given seasonal local food is often more affordable
    And Marcus needs to maximize his limited budget
    When Marcus plans meals
    Then the personal_agent should highlight seasonal options
    And it should explain what grows locally in current season
    And it should help him choose foods aligned with bioregional production
    And economic and ecological goals should align
    And he should learn that eating seasonally reduces costs and environmental impact
    And bioregional awareness should develop through practical benefit
