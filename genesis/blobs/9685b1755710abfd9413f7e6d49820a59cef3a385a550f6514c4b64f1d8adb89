Scenario: Coordinating sustainable practices with family consumption
    Given Margaret influences family's consumption and waste patterns
    And she can teach sustainable shopping and resource use
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates family sustainability
    Then it should help Margaret guide family toward sustainable practices
    And it should recognize her role in shaping family ecological impact
    And it should track family's movement toward sustainability
    And Margaret's influence should reduce family's environmental footprint
    And intergenerational sustainability should be recognized and valued
    And family care economy should include ecological care
