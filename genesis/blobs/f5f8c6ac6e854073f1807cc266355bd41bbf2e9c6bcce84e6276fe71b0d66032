Scenario: Learning from care economy participation across life stages
    Given Robert has participated in care economy as child, parent, and adult child
    And he now sees care patterns across the full lifecycle
    When his personal_agent helps him reflect on his care economy journey
    Then it should surface insights from his accumulated experience
    And help him recognize: "You learned care reciprocity from your parents' care for their parents"
    And connect past care received to present care given
    And support him in understanding care as lifecycle reciprocity
    And validate that his care contributions across decades have genuine value
    And help him see that he's building care economy that will serve his own aging
    And recognize his whole life as care economy participation
