Scenario: Politician evaluates economic development subsidy proposal with accountability
    Given corporation seeks tax breaks for promised job creation
    And presents rosy projections of economic benefits
    When the Observer analyzes company track record and subsidy impacts
    Then they see company's job creation performance in other jurisdictions
    And understand actual jobs created versus promised in past subsidies
    And calculate public cost per job versus wage quality
    And identify whether subsidized jobs pay living wages or require public assistance
    And demand accountability provisions in economic development deals
