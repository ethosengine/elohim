Scenario: Responding to national security agencies' concerns
    Given intelligence agencies claim protocol creates vulnerabilities
    And they request backdoors or monitoring capabilities
    When I evaluate security claims critically
    Then I consult: cryptographers about technical impossibility
    And I examine: whether concerns are legitimate or pretext
    And I compare: risks of backdoors vs risks they claim to address
    And I consider: historical abuse of security exceptions
    And I establish: oversight mechanisms if special provisions needed
    And I resist: security becoming excuse for unaccountable power
    And I protect: democracy even under security claims
