Scenario: Manager balances operational efficiency with community relationship priorities
    Given workers prioritize customer relationships over transaction speed
    And corporate model measured Marcus on speed metrics
    When Marcus coordinates daily operations
    Then Marcus optimizes for customer satisfaction and care, not just speed
    And Marcus measures success by community feedback and relationship depth
    And Marcus rejects corporate-style speedup pressure
    And operational coordination serves worker-defined values
    And community experiences genuine care, not performative corporate "service"
