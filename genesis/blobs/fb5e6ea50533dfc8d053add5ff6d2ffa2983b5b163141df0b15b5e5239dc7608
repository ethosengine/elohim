Scenario: Municipal public transit serves retired residents without car access
    Given Frank may not be able to afford car ownership
    And he relies on public transit and walking
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates transportation
    Then public transit should serve Frank's mobility needs effectively
    And routes and schedules should accommodate non-employment patterns
    And transit should enable access to medical, social, and civic destinations
    And affordable transit should support continued community participation
    And Frank should maintain mobility and independence through public infrastructure
    And municipal transportation should serve residents across lifespan
