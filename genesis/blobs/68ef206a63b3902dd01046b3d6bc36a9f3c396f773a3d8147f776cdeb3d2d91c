Scenario: Safety through neighborhood awareness and care
    Given Marcus is a 12-year-old shopping independently
    And neighborhood safety is important for his autonomy
    When Marcus moves through his neighborhood
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate informal care networks
    And local adults should be aware of children shopping independently
    And community care should provide informal oversight
    And Marcus should be safer through neighborhood relationships
    And his independence should be supported by community awareness
    And the protocol should build village-scale child protection
