Scenario: Shopping patterns contribute to neighborhood food access insights
    Given Marcus shops regularly at neighborhood stores
    And he tracks prices and availability across locations
    When Marcus's anonymized shopping data is aggregated
    Then it should contribute to neighborhood food access mapping
    And the neighborhood_elohim should identify food deserts
    And pricing patterns should be visible at neighborhood scale
    And Marcus's data should help others navigate local food systems
    And collective knowledge should reduce individual burden
    And his contributions should improve neighborhood food security
