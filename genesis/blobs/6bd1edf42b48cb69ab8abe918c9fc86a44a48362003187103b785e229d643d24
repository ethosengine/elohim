Scenario: Economic development board member tracks promised jobs from past incentives
    Given board previously approved incentive packages for business attraction
    And businesses promised specific job creation targets as incentive condition
    And board wants to know if incentives produced promised economic benefits
    When the board member uses Observer accountability tracking
    Then they see actual job creation versus promises for past incentive deals
    And discover many businesses created fewer jobs than committed
    And find weak enforcement mechanisms allowing businesses to keep incentives despite failures
    And access fiscal impact analysis showing poor return on incentive investment
    And accountability tracking reveals incentive outcomes diverged from projections
