Scenario: Parent knowledge of child's learning needs informs IEP and accommodations
    Given Sarah knows Tommy's and Emma's learning patterns intimately
    And children may need educational accommodations
    When schools develop individualized education plans
    Then Sarah's expertise should be central to planning
    And parent observations should drive accommodation decisions
    And the educational_elohim should document Sarah's knowledge
    And schools should recognize parents as essential IEP partners
    And the system should position parent knowledge as authoritative
    And Sarah's advocacy for children's needs should be valued and supported
