Scenario: Journalist investigates regulatory capture of environmental agency
    Given environmental regulations are weakly enforced
    And the journalist suspects industry influence over regulators
    When the Observer tracks regulatory agency decisions and relationships
    Then the journalist sees violation fines reduced 78% in 3 years
    And documents revolving door between industry and agency leadership
    And identifies campaign contributions from regulated industries
    And shows pattern of violations detected but not penalized
    And publishes investigation exposing regulatory capture
