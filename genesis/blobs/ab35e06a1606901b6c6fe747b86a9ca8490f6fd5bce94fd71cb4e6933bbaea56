Scenario: Teaching food sovereignty through kitchen skills
    Given Margaret knows how to cook from scratch and make nutritious meals
    And kitchen skills support food sovereignty and health
    When Margaret teaches grandchildren cooking and food preparation
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize cooking as care work
    And it should value food sovereignty education
    And it should track kitchen skills transmission
    And cooking should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's teaching should support family and community food security
    And traditional food knowledge should be preserved and valued
