Scenario: Respite and rest built into household governance
    Given Robert and Jennifer both experience care burden
    And sustainable care requires rest and renewal
    And they may deprioritize their own rest
    When household_elohim monitors wellbeing
    Then it should recognize when both partners need respite
    And prompt: "Neither of you has had break from care responsibilities in 6 weeks"
    And help them plan respite care for parents
    And coordinate breaks from care demands
    And validate that rest is essential, not selfish
    And support them in maintaining capacity for sustainable care
    And prevent burnout that would harm all family members
