Feature: Labor and Economic Development Policy Governance for Elected Representative
  As a politician in the public_observer system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer
  I want to make informed labor and economic policy decisions
  So that I can balance worker wellbeing with economic development and resist capture by business interests

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the politician user is registered in the system
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active

  Scenario: Politician understands worker constituent economic conditions
    Given the politician represents working-class district
    And hears business community claim workers are thriving
    When the Observer analyzes local economic and wage patterns
    Then they see median wages insufficient for local housing costs
    And identify workers holding multiple jobs to survive
    And understand constituent economic stress beyond unemployment numbers
    And learn which industries pay poverty wages requiring public assistance
    And champion worker-centered economic policy with evidence

  Scenario: Politician evaluates economic development subsidy proposal with accountability
    Given corporation seeks tax breaks for promised job creation
    And presents rosy projections of economic benefits
    When the Observer analyzes company track record and subsidy impacts
    Then they see company's job creation performance in other jurisdictions
    And understand actual jobs created versus promised in past subsidies
    And calculate public cost per job versus wage quality
    And identify whether subsidized jobs pay living wages or require public assistance
    And demand accountability provisions in economic development deals

  Scenario: Politician tracks accountability for job creation commitments
    Given the politician approved tax incentives for business expansion
    And company promised specific job creation and wage levels
    When the Observer monitors economic development outcomes
    Then they see actual jobs created versus commitments
    And track whether wages meet promised levels
    And identify whether company hires local workers versus imports
    And receive alerts when company fails to meet obligations
    And enforce accountability provisions or recapture subsidies

  Scenario: Politician surfaces worker priorities beyond business lobby
    Given the politician hears from business groups on labor policy
    But limited direct contact with worker constituents
    When the Observer aggregates worker constituent input
    Then they see workers prioritize healthcare access and paid sick leave
    And identify childcare costs as barrier to workforce participation
    And understand workplace safety concerns in specific industries
    And learn wage theft affects significant worker population
    And align labor policy with worker constituent needs

  Scenario: Politician evaluates living wage proposal with comprehensive impact analysis
    Given business lobby claims living wage ordinance will destroy jobs
    And worker advocates demand wage increase
    When the Observer provides evidence-based wage policy analysis
    Then they see living wage outcomes in comparable jurisdictions
    And understand actual employment impacts versus predicted job losses
    And identify public cost savings from reduced need for assistance programs
    And review worker quality of life improvements from wage increases
    And make informed decision beyond ideological claims

  Scenario: Politician builds coalition for worker protection legislation
    Given the politician champions paid sick leave requirement
    And needs support from diverse constituencies
    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities
    Then they see public health advocates support disease prevention
    And identify parent groups concerned about sick children and work
    And connect with faith communities serving working families
    And facilitate coalition across worker rights and community health interests
    And build broad-based support for worker protections

  Scenario: Politician exposes corporate wage theft patterns requiring enforcement
    Given worker advocates report systematic wage theft
    And enforcement resources are limited
    When the Observer analyzes wage and hour violations
    Then they see violation patterns by industry and employer
    And identify employers with repeated wage theft violations
    And understand which worker populations most affected
    And calculate economic impact of wage theft on working families
    And demand enforcement resources targeting systematic violators

  Scenario: Politician distinguishes business lobbying from small business reality
    Given corporate lobbying claims to represent small business
    And uses small business owners in advocacy campaigns
    When the Observer analyzes business community diversity
    Then they see large corporations drive policy positions
    And identify actual small business priorities differ from lobbying
    And understand small businesses harmed by corporate subsidies
    And distinguish authentic small business concerns from corporate manipulation
    And align economic policy with diverse business community

  Scenario: Politician evaluates workplace safety regulations with evidence
    Given business lobby opposes workplace safety regulations
    And claims compliance costs will harm competitiveness
    When the Observer analyzes workplace safety data and regulatory impacts
    Then they see injury and fatality rates in regulated versus unregulated contexts
    And understand compliance costs versus worker compensation and healthcare costs
    And identify which safety regulations most effectively prevent harm
    And review enforcement patterns and violation rates
    And make evidence-based decisions prioritizing worker safety

  Scenario: Politician navigates union relations with constituent worker focus
    Given the politician receives support from labor unions
    And business groups warn against union influence
    When the Observer provides balanced labor relations analysis
    Then they see how unionization affects worker wages and conditions
    And understand union priorities versus broader worker constituent needs
    And identify where union advocacy aligns with constituent interests
    And review economic impacts of unionization across industries
    And navigate union relations focused on worker constituent wellbeing

  Scenario: Politician monitors municipal employment practices as major employer
    Given the politician has authority over city or state employment
    And serves as model employer in jurisdiction
    When the Observer analyzes public sector employment patterns
    Then they see whether public wages meet living wage standards
    And identify disparities in public sector compensation by role
    And understand whether public employment offers quality jobs
    And learn contractor and subcontractor wage and labor practices
    And ensure public sector models worker-centered employment practices
