Scenario: Connecting with local food producers and farmers
    Given local farmers are doing care work to grow food
    And I am doing care work to prepare food
    When I want to connect with bioregional food producers
    Then the protocol should facilitate connections between workers and farmers
    And support relationships that strengthen local food systems
    And help me understand farming as care labor deserving dignity and fair compensation
    And build solidarity between farm workers and food service workers
