Scenario: Bioregional crop diversity protects against climate disruption
    Given monoculture agriculture is vulnerable to climate shocks
    And bioregional food security requires diverse production
    When democratic farms coordinate bioregional crop diversity
    Then multiple farms grow complementary crops reducing systemic risk
    And crop failures at one farm are buffered by others' success
    And regional food security is protected through diversity
    And climate resilience increases through bioregional coordination
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates crop diversity planning across farms
