    And recognize that her purchases sustain regional agriculture
    And show how local food choices support bioregional economy
    And connect her consumption to farmer livelihoods and land stewardship
    And help her understand food system as part of bioregional care economy
    And demonstrate that her choices affect ecosystem and economy together
