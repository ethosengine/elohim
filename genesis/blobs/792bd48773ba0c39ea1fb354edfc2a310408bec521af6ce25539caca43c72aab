Scenario: Meal planning adapted to Alex's preparation capabilities
    Given Alex has specific constraints around meal preparation
    And some physical tasks are difficult or impossible without assistance
    When Alex plans weekly meals
    Then the household_elohim should suggest meals within Alex's capabilities
    And it should account for what Alex can prepare independently
    And it should coordinate support worker assistance for complex prep
    And nutritional needs should be met within preparation constraints
    And meal planning should feel empowering, not limiting
    And Alex should maintain choice over their food and nutrition
    And adaptations should expand options, not restrict them
