Scenario: Caregiver's own health monitoring and protection
    Given James neglects his own health amid caregiving
    And caregiver health decline creates cascading crisis
    When the personal_agent monitors James's health
    Then it should ensure he attends his own medical appointments
    And it should prompt him to take prescribed medications
    And it should recognize when his health is declining
    And it should insist on self-care when necessary
    And James's health should be protected as essential infrastructure
