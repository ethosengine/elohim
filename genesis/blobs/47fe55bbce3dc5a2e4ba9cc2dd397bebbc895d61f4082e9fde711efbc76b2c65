Scenario: Privacy controls honor teen's developing autonomy
    Given Jasmine's care contributions are tracked across multiple contexts
    And she has legitimate need for privacy from parents
    When Jasmine configures her privacy settings
    Then she should have granular control over what data is shared with whom
    And parents should have access to family-relevant information only
    And her personal data (friendships, personal purchases, private reflections) should be protected
    And community resource coordinators should see care contributions but not private details
    And employers should not access her family or school data
    And Jasmine should actively learn to manage privacy boundaries
