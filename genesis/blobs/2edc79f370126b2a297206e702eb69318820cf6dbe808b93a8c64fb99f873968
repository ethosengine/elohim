Scenario: Teacher monitors superintendent promise on evaluation reform
    Given the superintendent promised to reduce evaluation paperwork burden
    And teachers experience evaluation as compliance not professional growth
    When the Observer tracks implementation over time
    Then teachers document that paperwork actually increased
    And evaluation time went from 8 hours to 12 hours annually
    And no evidence of professional development benefit
    And bring accountability data to board on broken promise
    And administrative commitments become enforceable through transparency
