Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult
  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want sophisticated partnership with my spouse around resource management and care coordination
  So that we can maintain household equity and prevent burnout amid intense multigenerational care demands

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the middle-aged user "Robert" is registered in the system
    And Robert is 52 years old with spouse "Jennifer"
    And they have children ages 19 and 22 and parents requiring increasing care
    And the household governance context is active
    And household_elohim coordinates household care economy
    And household income is $95,000/year stretched across generational needs

  Scenario: Household labor distribution made visible and equitable
    Given Robert and Jennifer both work full-time
    And they share household management, parent care, and child support
    And household labor distribution can become inequitable invisibly
    When household_elohim tracks care contributions
    Then it should make all household labor visible
    And surface patterns: "Jennifer has managed 78% of parent care coordination this month"
    And prompt discussion when distribution becomes unbalanced
    And help them negotiate equitable distribution
    And recognize that both partners carry substantial care burden
    And support them in maintaining partnership equity
    And prevent resentment from invisible labor imbalances

  Scenario: Financial planning coordinates household resources across generations
    Given Robert and Jennifer support children, care for parents, and plan for retirement
    And they have $95k/year to allocate across competing needs
    When household_elohim supports financial planning
    Then it should help them balance generational financial demands
    And surface tradeoffs: "Increasing parent care support by $500/month reduces retirement savings"
    And provide scenarios for different allocation strategies
    And help them understand long-term implications of current choices
    And support transparent decision-making about resource allocation
    And ensure both partners understand and agree to financial priorities
    And protect their own financial security while supporting generations

  Scenario: Elder care responsibilities coordinated between partners
    Given Robert's parents ages 78 and 75 require increasing care
    And Jennifer's father age 80 also needs support
    And coordinating three aging parents is complex
    When household_elohim coordinates elder care
    Then it should track care needs across three parents
    And help Robert and Jennifer distribute elder care responsibilities
    And surface conflicts: "Both mothers have medical appointments Tuesday 2pm"
    And coordinate with Robert's siblings and Jennifer's family
    And prevent one partner from being overwhelmed by elder care
    And recognize that elder care is shared household responsibility
    And support them in managing care without destroying their partnership

  Scenario: Household budget management amid competing generational demands
    Given the household supports adult children financially
    And contributes to parents' care costs
    And maintains their own household
    And saves for retirement
    When household_elohim manages budget
    Then it should track spending across generational categories
    And surface when one category expands unsustainably
    And provide analysis: "Child support increased 40% last quarter while retirement savings decreased"
    And help them make conscious choices about allocation
    And recognize when external support is needed
    And support sustainable household financial management
    And prevent financial crisis from competing demands

  Scenario: Communication and decision-making supported amid stress
    Given Robert and Jennifer are both under substantial stress
    And care demands can strain even strong partnerships
    And important household decisions must be made collaboratively
    When household_elohim facilitates communication
    Then it should provide structured decision-making support
    And ensure both partners have voice in household governance
    And surface when stress is affecting communication
    And prompt for check-ins: "You haven't had a planning conversation in 3 weeks"
    And support them in maintaining partnership health
    And recognize that their relationship needs protection amid care demands
    And prevent household governance breakdown under stress

  Scenario: Adult children's transition to independence coordinated at household level
    Given Robert and Jennifer's children are ages 19 and 22
    And the children are establishing independence with parental support
    And financial support needs to be coordinated between partners
    When household_elohim tracks child support
    Then it should make support patterns visible
    And help Robert and Jennifer align on support philosophy
    And surface when support exceeds household capacity
    And track support timeline: "Jordan has received $15k over 18 months for apartment and education"
    And help them negotiate appropriate levels of ongoing support
    And prevent one partner from committing household resources unilaterally
    And support coordinated approach to launching adult children

  Scenario: Household planning for both partners' future aging
    Given Robert and Jennifer are preparing for their own eventual aging
    And they watch their parents navigate aging challenges
    And they need to build resources for their own care
    When household_elohim supports retirement and aging planning
    Then it should help them plan for joint aging
    And coordinate long-term care insurance, retirement housing, and care resources
    And surface: "Your parents' care patterns suggest you should plan for similar needs"
    And help them build care economy resources that will serve them later
    And ensure they're preparing for aging with dignity
    And support building care networks that will remain as they age
    And prevent them from sacrificing their future for present demands

  Scenario: Respite and rest built into household governance
    Given Robert and Jennifer both experience care burden
    And sustainable care requires rest and renewal
    And they may deprioritize their own rest
    When household_elohim monitors wellbeing
    Then it should recognize when both partners need respite
    And prompt: "Neither of you has had break from care responsibilities in 6 weeks"
    And help them plan respite care for parents
    And coordinate breaks from care demands
    And validate that rest is essential, not selfish
    And support them in maintaining capacity for sustainable care
    And prevent burnout that would harm all family members

  Scenario: Household care tokens reflect both partners' contributions
    Given Robert and Jennifer both contribute substantial household labor
    And they coordinate care for parents and support for children
    When household_elohim calculates care tokens
    Then both partners' contributions should be valued appropriately
    And household labor should be recognized economically
    And care coordination should be valued alongside direct care
    And emotional labor should be made visible and valued
    And both partners should see their care work recognized
    And household care economy should operate on equity principles
    And token allocation should support rather than strain partnership

  Scenario: Household privacy maintained while coordinating with extended family
    Given Robert and Jennifer coordinate with Robert's siblings on parent care
    And they communicate with adult children about support
    And they participate in community care economy
    When household_elohim manages information sharing
    Then it should protect household privacy while enabling coordination
    And share parent care information with Robert's siblings appropriately
    And keep household financial details private from extended family
    And allow children to access relevant information without full household visibility
    And ensure community sees care contributions without sensitive details
    And support household autonomy while enabling family coordination

  Scenario: Household governance adapts to changing life stage needs
    Given Robert and Jennifer's care responsibilities are evolving
    And children are moving toward independence
    And parents are requiring increasing care
    And they approach their own pre-retirement years
    When household_elohim supports governance evolution
    Then it should help them adapt to changing circumstances
    And recognize shifts: "Child support demands are decreasing while parent care is increasing"
    And support planning for next life stage transitions
    And help them reimagine household as children leave
    And prepare for increased elder care coordination
    And support them in navigating lifecycle transitions together

  Scenario: Household resilience built through care economy participation
    Given Robert and Jennifer manage enormous complexity
    And they face potential crises: parent health emergencies, child crises, financial shocks
    When household_elohim builds resilience
    Then it should help them build emergency preparedness
    And connect them to community resources that can provide backup support
    And ensure they have networks to lean on in crisis
    And recognize that care economy participation builds reciprocal support
    And surface their accumulated social capital
    And help them understand that their care contributions create household resilience
    And support sustainable household functioning amid unpredictable demands
