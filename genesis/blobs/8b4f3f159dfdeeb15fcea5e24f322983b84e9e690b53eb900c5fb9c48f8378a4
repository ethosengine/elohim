Feature: Healthcare Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities
  As a person with disabilities navigating medical systems
  Operating at the healthcare/medical governance layer
  I want to maintain authority over my body and receive respectful care
  So that medical systems serve my flourishing rather than pathologizing my existence

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the person_with_disabilities user "Alex" is registered in the system
    And Alex has cerebral palsy requiring ongoing medical management
    And Alex navigates medical systems constantly (specialists, therapy, equipment)
    And the healthcare governance context is active
    And Alex's personal_agent supports medical advocacy
    And medical relationships are often fraught with ableist assumptions

  Scenario: Alex maintains authority over their own body and treatment
    Given medical providers often assume they know what's best for disabled patients
    And Alex has deep expertise about their own body and disability
    When Alex interacts with medical providers
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex assert bodily autonomy
    And it should support Alex in refusing unwanted treatments
    And it should remind providers that Alex is expert on their own needs
    And medical decisions should remain under Alex's control
    And the protocol should structurally defend Alex's medical self-determination
    And informed consent should be meaningful, not coerced
    And Alex's authority over their own body should be absolute

  Scenario: Tracking medical care quality and provider competence
    Given medical providers vary widely in disability competence
    And poor care from ableist providers causes harm
    When Alex receives medical care
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex track care quality
    And it should document which providers respect Alex's autonomy
    And it should identify patterns of ableist treatment
    And Alex should be able to rate providers on disability competence
    And quality tracking should help Alex find better providers
    And the protocol should make provider accountability visible
    And Alex should have data to advocate for better care

  Scenario: Refusing treatments that prioritize normalization over flourishing
    Given medical establishment often prioritizes making disabled people "normal"
    And some treatments harm quality of life in pursuit of normalcy
    When providers recommend treatments focused on normalization
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex evaluate treatments critically
    And it should distinguish between treatments that improve Alex's life and those that pursue normalcy
    And it should support Alex in refusing treatments that don't serve Alex's goals
    And Alex's definition of quality of life should be respected
    And the protocol should recognize that disabled lives are valuable as they are
    And medical goals should align with Alex's flourishing, not societal comfort
    And Alex should be supported in rejecting medical model thinking

  Scenario: Documenting medical discrimination and ableism
    Given medical systems frequently discriminate against disabled people
    And ableism in healthcare can be life-threatening
    When Alex experiences medical discrimination
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex document discriminatory incidents
    And it should identify patterns of discriminatory treatment
    And it should connect Alex to legal resources and advocacy organizations
    And documentation should support complaints to licensing boards
    And the protocol should take medical discrimination seriously
    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves from medical harm
    And systemic patterns should be made visible for accountability

  Scenario: Navigating medical equipment needs with dignity

    Then the personal_agent should help Alex navigate equipment systems
    And it should track equipment needs and maintenance schedules
    And it should help Alex advocate for appropriate equipment
    And it should document when insurance denies necessary equipment
    And Alex should maintain dignity throughout equipment acquisition
    And the protocol should reduce bureaucratic burden
    And equipment should be framed as essential tools, not medical devices

  Scenario: Managing complex medication regimens with cognitive support
    Given Alex may have multiple medications with complex schedules
    And medication management is cognitively demanding
    When Alex manages medications
    Then the personal_agent should provide medication reminders
    And it should track medication schedules and adherence
    And it should alert Alex to potential interactions
    And it should help Alex communicate with prescribers
    And cognitive support should reduce medication management burden
    And the protocol should serve Alex's health goals
    And Alex should maintain control over medication decisions

  Scenario: Coordinating multiple specialists while maintaining integrated care
    Given Alex sees multiple medical specialists
    And specialists often don't communicate with each other
    When Alex navigates specialist care
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex coordinate across providers
    And it should maintain integrated medical history across specialties
    And it should help Alex communicate between providers
    And it should identify care gaps or contradictions
    And Alex should experience coherent care despite system fragmentation
    And the protocol should serve as Alex's medical coordination hub
    And integrated perspective should be maintained by Alex, not system

  Scenario: Protecting Alex from quality of life assumptions
    Given medical providers often make negative assumptions about disabled people's quality of life
    And these assumptions can lead to withheld or substandard care
    When providers discuss treatment options
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex challenge quality of life assumptions
    And it should assert that Alex's life is valuable and worth full treatment
    And it should document when providers suggest limiting care based on disability
    And Alex should receive same standard of care as non-disabled patients
    And the protocol should recognize that quality of life bias is discrimination
    And Alex's right to full medical care should be defended
    And assumptions about disability should never limit treatment options

  Scenario: Preventing medical gaslighting and dismissal of symptoms
    Given medical providers often dismiss disabled patients' symptom reports
    And medical gaslighting is common experience for disabled people
    When Alex reports new symptoms or health concerns
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex document symptom patterns
    And it should track which providers take Alex's reports seriously
    And it should support Alex in insisting on appropriate investigation
    And it should help Alex distinguish new symptoms from existing disability
    And Alex's expertise about their own body should be validated
    And the protocol should help Alex advocate against medical dismissal
    And symptom documentation should support Alex in being believed

    Then the personal_agent should help verify facility accessibility
    And it should coordinate transportation and support services
    And it should prepare accessibility information for providers in advance
    And it should track appointment schedules across multiple providers
    And logistics coordination should reduce Alex's burden
    And the protocol should make medical access less stressful
    And barriers should be identified and addressed proactively

  Scenario: Insurance navigation and benefits advocacy

    Then the personal_agent should help Alex understand insurance benefits
    And it should track what's covered and what's been denied
    And it should support Alex in appeals processes
    And it should document medical necessity for needed services
    And Alex should have support in fighting insurance denials
    And the protocol should reduce insurance navigation burden
    And Alex should be able to access needed care despite insurance barriers

  Scenario: Building relationships with disability-competent providers
    Given finding good disability-competent providers is challenging

    And it should maintain provider ratings from disability community
    And it should help Alex interview potential providers about disability approach
    And it should support Alex in building strong therapeutic relationships
    And Alex should be able to find providers who respect disabled expertise
    And the protocol should facilitate connection to good care
    And disability community knowledge should be leveraged to find competent providers

  Scenario: Medical privacy protects Alex from unauthorized disclosure
    Given medical information is highly sensitive
    And disability status can lead to discrimination if disclosed
    When Alex's medical information is collected
    Then the personal_agent should ensure strict medical privacy
    And it should control what medical information is shared with whom
    And workplace should never receive medical details
    And family should only access what Alex permits
    And insurance should receive minimum necessary information
    And Alex's medical privacy should be maximally protected
    And the protocol should prevent unauthorized medical disclosure systematically
