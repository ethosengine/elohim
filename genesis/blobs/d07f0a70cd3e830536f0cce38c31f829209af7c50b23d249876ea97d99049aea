Scenario: Building social capital for future care needs
    Given Margaret is relatively healthy and capable now
    And she will need more support as she ages
    When Margaret makes neighborhood care contributions
    Then she should be building relationships for her future
    And social capital should accumulate through current contributions
    And neighbors should develop sense of connection and reciprocity
    And Margaret's future care needs will be met by strong relationships
    And she's investing in the community that will care for her
    And strategic relationship-building for aging should be supported
