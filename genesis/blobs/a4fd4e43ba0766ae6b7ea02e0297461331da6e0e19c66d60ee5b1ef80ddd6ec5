Scenario: Household governance adapts to changing life stage needs
    Given Robert and Jennifer's care responsibilities are evolving
    And children are moving toward independence
    And parents are requiring increasing care
    And they approach their own pre-retirement years
    When household_elohim supports governance evolution
    Then it should help them adapt to changing circumstances
    And recognize shifts: "Child support demands are decreasing while parent care is increasing"
    And support planning for next life stage transitions
    And help them reimagine household as children leave
    And prepare for increased elder care coordination
    And support them in navigating lifecycle transitions together
