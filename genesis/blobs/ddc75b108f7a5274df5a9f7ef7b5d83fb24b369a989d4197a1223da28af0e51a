Scenario: Teen's substantial care work made visible to family
    Given Jasmine manages weekly grocery shopping for the family
    And she coordinates dinner preparation 3 nights per week
    And she provides childcare for Jordan after school
    When the family_elohim processes her contributions
    Then Jasmine's care work should be visible on the family dashboard
    And her contributions should be quantified and valued
    And parent Maya should see specific recognition prompts
    And family care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions
    And the visibility should prevent the invisibility that often surrounds teen household labor
    And Jasmine should experience being valued as a genuine contributor
