Scenario: Worker exits with portable documented expertise
    Given Maria has accumulated 8 years of documented contributions
    And she decides to leave ChickenMax for another opportunity
    When she requests her portable REA profile
    Then she receives cryptographically signed documentation of her expertise
    And her profile includes training mastery, care work, and management skills
    And she can present this profile to prospective employers
    And her accumulated skill tokens remain valid across the EAE network
    And her ownership tokens are converted to fair value upon exit
