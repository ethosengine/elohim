Scenario: Household care token accumulation includes Alex's contributions
    Given Alex participates in care token economy
    And Alex contributes to household through management and coordination
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then Alex's household management labor should be valued appropriately
    And Alex's cognitive work of coordinating support should count
    And care tokens should accumulate from Alex's contributions
    And Alex should receive care token supplements based on household income level
    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status
    And Alex should be positioned as contributor, not just recipient
    And economic standing should reflect Alex's actual care work
