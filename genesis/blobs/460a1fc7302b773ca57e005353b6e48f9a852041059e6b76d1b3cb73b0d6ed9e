Scenario: Tracking personal goals and progress during crisis recovery
    Given I am rebuilding my life after leaving an abusive relationship
    And I have set personal goals for stability and independence
    When I make progress toward my goals (even small steps)
    Then the Value Scanner celebrates my achievements
    And tracks my progress without imposing external timelines
    And helps me identify next steps at my pace
    And recognizes setbacks as normal parts of recovery
    And maintains my focus on my vision for my future
    And counters institutional pressure to recover "faster" or "properly"
    And my personal_agent reminds me of how far I've come
    And validates that my timeline is the right timeline
