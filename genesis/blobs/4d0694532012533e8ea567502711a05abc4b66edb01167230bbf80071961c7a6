Scenario: Organizer builds coalition for climate adaptation investment
    Given low-income neighborhoods face worst climate impacts
    But climate funding flows to wealthy areas
    When the organizer uses Observer to identify alignment
    Then they connect communities facing flooding, heat islands, poor air quality
    And document systematic disinvestment in climate resilience
    And coordinate coalition demanding equitable climate spending
    And facilitate testimony from diverse affected communities
    And climate justice becomes redistributive investment campaign
