Scenario: Selected for National Constitutional Council serving entire nation
    Given I have experience from community and regional council service
    And I was randomly selected for national level
    When I accept my 6-month national council appointment
    Then I understand: my judgments will affect millions of people
    And I receive: intensive training on national constitutional interpretation
    And I meet: weekly with diverse citizens from across the nation
    And I am supported: with full compensation and resources
    And I feel: profound responsibility for democratic governance
    And I bring: nurse-mother wisdom to questions of national importance
    And I know: ordinary citizens like me are humanity's democratic hope
