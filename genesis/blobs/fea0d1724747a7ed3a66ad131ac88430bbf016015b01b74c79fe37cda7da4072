Scenario: Building care economy capital for future aging needs
    Given Margaret is watching her mother navigate advanced aging
    And Margaret recognizes she will need care in 10-20 years
    When Margaret makes care contributions now
    Then care tokens should accumulate to her individual account
    And these tokens should represent future care economy resources
    And the system should help her build reciprocal relationships
    And she should be preparing for her own increasing care needs
    And current contributions should create future security
    And Margaret should experience agency in planning her own aging
    And care economy capital should provide retirement resilience
