Scenario: Financial planning coordinates household resources across generations
    Given Robert and Jennifer support children, care for parents, and plan for retirement
    And they have $95k/year to allocate across competing needs
    When household_elohim supports financial planning
    Then it should help them balance generational financial demands
    And surface tradeoffs: "Increasing parent care support by $500/month reduces retirement savings"
    And provide scenarios for different allocation strategies
    And help them understand long-term implications of current choices
    And support transparent decision-making about resource allocation
    And ensure both partners understand and agree to financial priorities
    And protect their own financial security while supporting generations
