Scenario: Politician monitors special education compliance and outcomes
    Given the politician has legal obligation to serve students with disabilities
    And families report barriers to appropriate services
    When the Observer tracks special education implementation
    Then they see evaluation and IEP compliance rates by school
    And identify which students wait longest for evaluations
    And understand resource allocation for special education services
    And learn where families face pushback on service requests
    And ensure legal obligations and student needs are met
