Feature: Municipal Economic Development Through Democratic Investment
  As a community_investor in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want to support citywide democratic economy development
  So that municipal policy enables community investment and democratic ownership

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Patricia's community investment is part of emerging municipal democratic economy
    And the municipality governance context is active
    And community investment demonstrates alternative to corporate economic development

  Scenario: Community investment demonstrates alternative to corporate subsidy model
    Given municipal economic development typically subsidizes corporate expansion
    And Patricia's taxes funded corporate subsidies with minimal community benefit
    When community investment proves superior economic development strategy
    Then her $10K investment creates more jobs and better wages than equivalent corporate subsidy
    And no public money is required—private capital supports democratic conversions
    And municipal officials observe community investment effectiveness
    And economic development strategy shifts toward supporting democratic ownership
    And municipality_elohim documents community investment outcomes for policy advocacy

  Scenario: Investor advocates for municipal community investment tax incentives
    Given municipality offers tax breaks for corporate investment
    And community investment lacks equivalent policy support
    When Patricia and other investors organize for policy change
    Then they advocate to city council for community investment tax credits
    And propose municipal matching funds for community investment pools
    And credible advocacy comes from investors who've proven model viability
    And municipal policy evolves to support community investment and democratic ownership
    And municipality_elohim coordinates investor advocacy and policy development

  Scenario: Municipal community investment fund amplifies private capital
    Given community investment pools have limited capital for large conversions
    And municipal economic development funds could support democratic ownership
    When city creates municipal community investment fund
    Then Patricia's private investment is matched by public funds
    And combined capital enables larger conversions (grocery stores, manufacturers)
    And public-private partnership supports democratic economy at scale
    And taxpayer money supports community wealth-building, not corporate extraction
    And municipality_elohim manages public-private community investment coordination

  Scenario: Investor network coordinates citywide democratic business support
    Given isolated community investment pools lack coordination
    And municipal-scale transformation requires network coordination
    When investors organize citywide community investment network
    Then capital is coordinated across neighborhoods for strategic conversions
    And successful practices are shared across community investment pools
    And collective bargaining power increases with financial institutions
    And citywide democratic economy infrastructure develops through investor coordination
    And municipality_elohim facilitates citywide investor network coordination

  Scenario: Community investment outcomes inform municipal workforce development
    Given workforce development programs prepare workers for corporate employment
    And democratic businesses need workers with cooperative governance skills
    When community investors demonstrate democratic business viability
    Then municipal workforce programs add cooperative business and democratic governance training
    And workers are prepared for democratic enterprise participation
    And investor advocacy influences workforce development policy
    And municipal investment in workforce supports democratic economy growth
    And municipality_elohim coordinates democratic business training curriculum development

  Scenario: Municipal procurement policies prioritize democratically-owned businesses
    Given city purchases goods and services from private vendors
    And public procurement can support democratic economy development
    When investors advocate for democratic business procurement preferences
    Then municipal contracts give priority to worker-owned businesses
    And Patricia's investments benefit from stable public sector demand
    And taxpayer money supports living wages and democratic governance
    And procurement policy demonstrates municipal commitment to economic democracy
    And municipality_elohim tracks democratic business procurement and impacts

  Scenario: Community investment supports municipal affordable housing development
    Given housing is major community need and investment opportunity
    And Patricia wants to invest in affordable housing with democratic governance
    When community investment expands to housing cooperatives
    Then her capital supports converting apartment buildings to resident ownership
    And affordable housing is preserved through democratic governance
    And housing investment provides returns while addressing municipal affordability crisis
    And community wealth-building extends to housing alongside businesses
    And municipality_elohim coordinates housing cooperative investment and development

  Scenario: Municipal economic development metrics evolve to measure democratic ownership
    Given cities measure economic development by job quantity, not quality
    And Patricia's investments create high-quality jobs (living wages, ownership, voice)
    When community investors demonstrate democratic ownership benefits
    Then municipal metrics include: worker ownership rates, wage levels, democratic governance participation
    And economic development success is measured by community wealth-building
    And democratic conversions score highly on quality-focused metrics
    And policy priorities shift toward job quality through investor advocacy
    And municipality_elohim provides democratic economy measurement framework

  Scenario: Investor coordinates with municipal climate action through sustainable business investment
    Given municipal climate action requires reducing emissions and building resilience
    And Patricia's investments support sustainable democratic businesses
    When community investment aligns with municipal climate goals
    Then democratic businesses achieve climate targets (local sourcing, renewable energy, waste reduction)
    And community investment supports climate-positive enterprises
    And municipal climate funding can support democratic business conversions
    And climate action and economic democracy align through coordinated investment
    And municipality_elohim coordinates climate-aligned democratic business investment

  Scenario: Community investment enables municipal small business preservation
    Given small business displacement threatens community character and economic diversity
    And Patricia values preserving local businesses as community institutions
    When community investment supports exit-to-community conversions
    Then small businesses are preserved as democratic enterprises, not displaced by chains
    And municipal economic diversity is maintained through democratic conversions
    And community investment becomes small business preservation strategy
    And neighborhood character is protected through democratic ownership
    And municipality_elohim tracks small business preservation through community investment

  Scenario: Municipal financial institutions develop community investment products
    Given banks and credit unions lack experience with democratic business investment
    And institutional support would scale community investment dramatically
    When Patricia and other investors demonstrate model viability
    Then local banks develop community investment accounts and funds
    And credit unions prioritize democratic business lending
    And financial institutions see community investment as sound business opportunity
    And municipal policy supports financial institution democratic business focus
    And municipality_elohim coordinates with financial institutions on product development

  Scenario: Investor participation in municipal economic development planning
    Given economic development planning typically excludes community voices
    And Patricia has expertise from community investment experience
    When municipal planning includes community investor participation
    Then she serves on economic development advisory committees
    And community investment perspective informs municipal strategy
    And policy development benefits from investor practical knowledge
    And democratic economy becomes recognized municipal economic development approach
    And municipality_elohim facilitates community investor participation in municipal planning
