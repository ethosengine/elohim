Scenario: Professional associations adopt care economy frameworks
    Given Robert participates in professional associations
    And professional associations shape industry norms and practices
    And care economy principles should inform professional standards
    When industry_elohim supports professional association engagement
    Then it should help Robert advocate within professional associations
    And support proposals for care economy professional development
    And connect him with other care economy advocates in the profession
    And help professional associations adopt care-friendly certification standards
    And build professional identity that includes care economy principles
    And advance care economy through professional credentialing
    And demonstrate that all professions can integrate care economy
