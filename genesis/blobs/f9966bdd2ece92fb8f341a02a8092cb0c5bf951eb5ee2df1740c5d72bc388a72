Given I need evidence for policy evaluation
And research must be independent to be credible
When I establish national research program
Then I fund: rigorous evaluation by independent researchers
And I require: open access publication
And I support: longitudinal studies tracking long-term outcomes
And I enable: replication and peer review
And I demand: honest reporting including null results
And evidence base: supports informed democratic choice
And public funding: serves public knowledge
