Scenario: Appeal after family member death reveals intervention value
    Given Family Elohim previously intervened in my mental health situation
    And at the time I was angry and felt violated
    And my brother had died by suicide with similar warning signs
    When I reflect months later that the intervention likely saved my life
    Then I can acknowledge the intervention was appropriate despite initial anger
    And I can update my preferences knowing I'm glad to be alive
    And The appeal process allowed me to be heard at my most angry moment
    And Reconciliation with the agent happens through mutual respect
    And The balance between care and control was negotiated not imposed
    And This represents successful partnership between human and AI
