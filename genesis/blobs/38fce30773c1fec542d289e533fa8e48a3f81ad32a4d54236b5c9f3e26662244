Scenario: Community respite care accessible through care economy
    Given James needs regular respite to prevent burnout
    And formal respite care costs $20-30/hour he cannot afford
    When James accesses community respite resources
    Then his care token accumulation should subsidize respite costs
    And community should provide respite care at accessible rates
    And respite should be professional-quality and reliable
    And care economy should ensure caregivers get necessary breaks
    And community should invest in caregiver sustainability
