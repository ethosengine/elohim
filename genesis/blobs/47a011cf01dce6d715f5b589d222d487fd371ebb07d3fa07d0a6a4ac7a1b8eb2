Scenario: Educational support targeted to preteen's actual learning needs
    Given Marcus has gaps in some areas and advanced skills in others
    And his education should serve his whole development
    When educational resources are allocated
    Then support should target his actual needs, not age assumptions
    And he should receive advanced instruction in areas of strength
    And he should get support in areas where household burden limits learning
    And education should be personalized to his unique situation
    And the system should ensure his care burden doesn't limit his education
    And he should have full educational opportunity despite responsibilities
