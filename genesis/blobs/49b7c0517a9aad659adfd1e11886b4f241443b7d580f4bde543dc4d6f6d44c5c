Scenario: Funding community protocol infrastructure sustainably
    Given Riverside needs resources for community nodes and maintenance
    And we are relatively poor community
    When I cobble together funding from multiple sources
    Then we allocate: municipal budget treating this as public infrastructure
    And we create: community ownership cooperative with resident investment
    And we apply: for state and federal grants
    And we participate: in mutual aid with wealthier communities
    And we ensure: community retains ownership
    And we plan: for 10-year sustainability not just pilot
    And public investment: supports democratic governance tools
