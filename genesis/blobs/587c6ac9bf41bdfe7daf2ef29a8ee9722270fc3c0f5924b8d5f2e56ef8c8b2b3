Scenario: Managing children's school participation despite resource constraints
    Given school requires fees, supplies, or resources I cannot afford
    And children need to participate fully in educational activities
    When resource constraints threaten children's school participation
    Then the Value Scanner identifies school assistance programs and resources
    And helps me access fee waivers, supply assistance, scholarship programs
    And connects me to community resources for school needs
    And validates that lack of resources shouldn't exclude children
    And my personal_agent tracks school financial requirements and deadlines
    And recognizes resource navigation as substantial invisible labor
    And ensures children's educational participation despite poverty
