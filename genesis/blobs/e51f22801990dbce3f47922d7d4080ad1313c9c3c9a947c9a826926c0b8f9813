Scenario: Activist documents neighborhood displacement patterns
    Given the activist is organizing against gentrification
    And needs evidence of displacement in specific neighborhoods
    When the Observer provides hyperlocal data
    Then the activist sees rent increase patterns by block
    And views eviction filing trends over time
    And identifies buildings with code violations
    And maps demographic changes showing displacement
    And organizes residents with documented evidence
