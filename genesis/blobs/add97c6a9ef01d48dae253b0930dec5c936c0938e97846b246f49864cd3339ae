Scenario: Balancing national security claims with individual rights
    Given an appeal challenges agent decision justified by security concerns
    And I must weigh existential threats against individual dignity
    When we review the security-rights balance
    Then we evaluate: if security claim was legitimate or pretext
    And we examine: if less rights-violating alternatives existed
    And we consider: transparency appropriate to security context
    And we establish: constitutional limits on authority even under threat
    And we prevent: security from becoming excuse for unchecked power
    And we create: precedent for how democracy functions under danger
    And we protect: both security and rights through wise judgment
