    Then the educational_elohim should recognize ecological education
    And teaching about local food, seasonal eating, food waste should be valued
    And Sarah's work to build children's food literacy should accumulate tokens
    And the system should recognize ecological food education as care work
    And next generation should learn food as ecological relationship
    And Sarah's teaching should be valued as environmental stewardship
