Scenario: Understanding environmental impact of food choices
    Given Marcus is developing capacity for abstract thinking
    And environmental sustainability connects to care economy
    When Marcus makes food choices
    Then the personal_agent should provide age-appropriate environmental information
    And it should explain ecological impact in concrete terms
    And it should not overwhelm him with climate anxiety
    And it should frame environmental care as extension of household care
    And ecological literacy should develop alongside care economy principles
    And stewardship should extend from family to bioregion
