Scenario: Family respite coordination to prevent James's burnout
    Given James needs regular respite or he will collapse
    And family members could provide some respite care
    When the family_elohim coordinates respite
    Then it should identify family members who could help
    And it should schedule regular respite periods
    And it should ensure James gets breaks from intensive care
    And family should actively provide respite, not just sympathy
    And respite coordination should be systematic, not ad hoc
