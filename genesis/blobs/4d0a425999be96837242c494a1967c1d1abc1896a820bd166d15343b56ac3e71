Scenario: Sarah's support for aging parents made visible
    Given Sarah's parents are aging and need increasing support
    And Sarah helps with medical appointments, financial planning, household tasks
    When the family_elohim tracks Sarah's elder care
    Then it should recognize this as substantial care labor
    And it should show Sarah is simultaneously caring up and down generations
    And elder care should accumulate care tokens
    And the family should see Sarah's sandwich generation burden
    And her care for aging parents should be valued alongside childcare
    And multigenerational care should be comprehensive and visible
