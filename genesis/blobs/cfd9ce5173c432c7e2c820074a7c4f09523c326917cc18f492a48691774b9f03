Scenario: Accessing neighborhood services while managing transportation barriers
    Given I don't have reliable transportation
    And many neighborhood resources require travel
    When I need to access services across the neighborhood
    Then the Value Scanner optimizes my travel for efficiency
    And identifies services accessible by walking or public transit
    And helps me batch errands to minimize trips
    And surfaces transportation assistance programs
    And coordinates with neighbors for ride-sharing when appropriate
    And my personal_agent plans routes considering my constraints
    And recognizes transportation navigation as significant invisible labor
    And validates that lack of transportation makes everything harder
