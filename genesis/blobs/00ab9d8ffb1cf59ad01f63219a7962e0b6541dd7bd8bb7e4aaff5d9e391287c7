Scenario: Support worker scheduling coordinated efficiently
    Given Alex requires assistance with specific physical tasks
    And support workers have their own schedules
    When Alex needs to coordinate support services
    Then the household_elohim should help schedule support worker visits efficiently
    And it should match Alex's needs with worker availability
    And Alex should be able to communicate requirements clearly
    And schedule changes should be accommodated flexibly
    And coordination should reduce Alex's cognitive load
    And Alex should maintain authority over when and how support is provided
    And the system should serve Alex's independence, not create dependence
