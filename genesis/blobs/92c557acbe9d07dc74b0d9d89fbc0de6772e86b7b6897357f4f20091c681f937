Scenario: Shared grocery shopping with roommates
    Given Aisha and her roommates share food costs
    And they have different dietary preferences
    When they use the Value Scanner for shared shopping
    Then the household_elohim should track individual contributions
    And it should manage the shared household budget
    And it should accommodate different preferences within budget
    And care tokens should reflect each person's shopping labor
    And the system should prevent household conflicts over resources
    And equitable cost-sharing should be transparent
