Scenario: Parent networks coordinate community-wide childcare infrastructure
    Given multiple families need reliable, affordable childcare
    And current market solutions are inadequate
    When the community_elohim coordinates childcare infrastructure
    Then it should enable parent-led cooperative childcare
    And it should help organize community-owned childcare centers
    And parent labor should be valued in cooperative structures
    And care tokens should enable access regardless of income
    And the community should build childcare as commons, not commodity
    And the system should enable collective solutions to care needs
