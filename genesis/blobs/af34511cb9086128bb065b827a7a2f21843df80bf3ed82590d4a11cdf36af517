\#\# Discussion Question:

Consider Jesus' teachings on wisdom and responsibility in His Kingdom theology, alongside what we've learned about righteous leadership in the Old Testament and our modern challenges with technology and information systems. How might Jesus' approach to expanding responsibility and scaling wisdom inform our work as Christian technologists? 

Specifically:  
\- How can we design digital systems that embody the spirit of Jesus' teachings, emphasizing inner transformation and compassionate action over mere compliance or engagement metrics?  
\- In what ways can we apply Jesus' model of servant leadership to our roles in developing and managing technology platforms?  
\- How might Jesus' parable of the talents guide our approach to stewarding the powerful technological tools at our disposal?  
\- Given Jesus' ability to wisely navigate complex social and political situations, how can we create technologies that help users do the same in our increasingly complex digital landscape?

Reflect on how these principles could reshape our approach to scaling wisdom through technology while remaining true to our calling as followers of Christ.
