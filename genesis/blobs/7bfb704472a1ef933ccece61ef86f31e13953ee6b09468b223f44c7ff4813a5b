Scenario: Planning for aging together with dignity and agency
    Given Frank and his wife are both aging
    And their capabilities and care needs will change over time
    And they're committed to supporting each other
    When the household_elohim supports aging planning
    Then it should help them plan for increasing care needs together
    And it should facilitate conversations about future care scenarios
    And it should coordinate with family about eventual support needs
    And it should help them maintain autonomy as long as possible
    And planning should preserve both partners' dignity and agency
    And they should experience aging as partners, not burdens to each other
