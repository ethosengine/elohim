Scenario: Activist establishes protected digital identity
    Given the activist is setting up their personal node
    When they configure their activist identity with privacy controls
    And they designate trusted sanctuary institutions for backup
    And they enable multi-factor authentication with biometric verification
    Then their identity is cryptographically secured on their personal node
    And their data is encrypted end-to-end
    And sanctuary protocols are established with designated institutions
    And the system confirms digital sovereignty is established
