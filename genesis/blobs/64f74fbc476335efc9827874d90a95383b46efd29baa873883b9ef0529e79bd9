Scenario: Child's care contributions visible at neighborhood scale
    Given Emma makes consistent stewardship choices
    And neighborhood care economy tracks contributions
    When Emma's patterns are recognized by neighborhood_elohim
    Then her contributions should be visible at appropriate scale
    And recognition should reflect community-level impact
    And Emma should learn her care matters beyond just family
    And she should understand she is contributing to neighborhood flourishing
    And care visibility should extend across governance layers
    And identity as community member should be forming
