Scenario: Retired residents build care economy infrastructure through organizing
    Given Frank and other retired residents have time for organizing
    And care economy requires coordination and infrastructure
    When the community_elohim supports infrastructure building
    Then it should enable retired residents to organize care economy systems
    And coordinate tool libraries, skill shares, mutual aid networks
    And facilitate care coordination that benefits all community members
    And recognize organizing labor as valuable care contribution
    And retired residents should be understood as infrastructure builders
    And Frank should help establish care economy as normal community practice
