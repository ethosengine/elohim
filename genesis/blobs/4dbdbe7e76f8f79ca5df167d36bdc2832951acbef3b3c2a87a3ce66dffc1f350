Scenario: Accessing employment support services and job training programs
    Given various programs offer employment support for vulnerable populations
    And these programs vary widely in quality and appropriateness
    When I seek employment support services
    Then the workplace_elohim identifies quality employment support programs
    And helps me access job training, resume support, interview coaching
    And evaluates whether programs are genuinely helpful vs. bureaucratic
    And connects me to programs that respect my dignity and capability
    And validates that I deserve quality employment support
    And my personal_agent tracks program applications and requirements
    And recognizes that navigating employment services is labor
    And ensures employment support actually supports rather than burdens me
