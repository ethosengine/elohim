Scenario: Developer employment impacts on community economics
    Given a developer's project will employ 150 construction workers
    And claims significant economic impact on local economy
    When the Observer analyzes actual community economic impacts
    Then analysis shows: most workers spend earnings in home communities not locally
    And temporary jobs create temporary spending not sustained economic benefit
    And few local businesses benefit from construction employment
    And honest economic analysis reveals limited community benefit
    And employment claims need scrutiny about actual community economics
