Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained for adult user
    Given Aisha has full autonomy over technology use
    And the constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Aisha chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then the disconnection must be honored immediately
    And all data retention must follow legal minimums only
    And no manipulative patterns should attempt to retain usage
    And Aisha's right to opt out must be absolute
    And the system must respect her sovereign choice
