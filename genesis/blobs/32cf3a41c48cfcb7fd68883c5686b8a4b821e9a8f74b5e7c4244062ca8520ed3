Scenario: Managing family financial governance with child support uncertainty
    Given I am supposed to receive child support but it's unreliable
    And family finances are therefore unpredictable
    When I manage family financial planning with uncertain child support
    Then the family_elohim helps me plan for multiple scenarios
    And tracks child support payments and non-payments
    And documents non-payment for legal enforcement if needed
    And helps me make financial decisions despite uncertainty
    And connects me to legal resources for child support enforcement
    And my personal_agent alerts me to missing payments
    And recognizes management of financial uncertainty as cognitive labor
    And validates that unreliable support makes everything harder
