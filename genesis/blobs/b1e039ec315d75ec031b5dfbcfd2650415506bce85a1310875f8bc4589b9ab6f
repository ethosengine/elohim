Scenario: Resource constraints create low consumption footprint
    Given Maria cannot afford unnecessary purchases or waste
    And she maximizes every dollar and minimizes consumption
    When her household's environmental impact is assessed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her low consumption footprint
    And it should frame her thrift as environmental virtue, not just poverty
    And her resource efficiency should be celebrated as ecological stewardship
    And economic constraint should be reframed as environmental contribution
    And Maria should see her household as environmentally exemplary
