Scenario: Transition steward compensation reflects expertise without recreating extraction
    Given Rosa receives $55K annually for coordination and knowledge transfer
    And this must be fair without enabling exploitation
    When steward compensation is evaluated democratically
    Then workers verify Rosa's salary is justified by coordination value
    And compensation is transparent and subject to democratic approval
    And Rosa cannot use steward role to reclaim ownership control
    And after two years, role ends with clear transition to worker autonomy
    And workplace_elohim monitors to prevent steward role from becoming new hierarchy
