Scenario: Learning community history and values through participation
    Given Aisha is new to the community
    And understanding community values takes time
    When Aisha participates in community care economy
    Then she should learn community history through engagement
    And long-term residents should transmit community values
    And the community_elohim should facilitate cultural transmission
    And Aisha should understand community context through practice
    And care economy should teach community membership
    And participation should integrate newcomers into community culture
