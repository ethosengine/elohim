Scenario: Making visible that work schedules limit neighborhood participation
    Given many neighborhood activities happen during work hours
    When my work schedule prevents participation
    Then the protocol should make visible that employment structures exclude workers
    And advocate for neighborhood activities at accessible times
    And help neighborhood understand workers' constraints
    And push for inclusive neighborhood care economy design
