Scenario: Workers gradually assume democratic governance responsibilities
    Given Rosa previously made all strategic business decisions alone
    And workers need to develop governance capacity and confidence
    When democratic transition timeline begins
    Then early phase: Rosa proposes decisions, workers approve and learn rationale
    And middle phase: workers propose decisions, Rosa advises and supports
    And late phase: workers decide democratically, Rosa consults only when requested
    And workplace_elohim tracks governance capacity growth over transition period
    And power genuinely transfers without hierarchical recapture
