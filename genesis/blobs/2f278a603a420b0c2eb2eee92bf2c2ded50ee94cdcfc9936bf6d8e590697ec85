Scenario: Teaching that care work creates economic value
    Given traditional economics makes care work invisible
    And Emma is forming foundational economic understanding
    When Emma performs care labor through scanner decisions
    Then the system should explicitly teach care creates value
    And her personal_agent should say "Your stewardship helped your family"
    And care contributions should be valued concretely
    And she should learn caring for others is economically valuable
    And care economy framework should be established as baseline
    And she should understand care before being exposed to extraction economics
