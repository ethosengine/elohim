Scenario: Coordinating shared meals around work schedules
    Given my roommates and I want to share meal costs and preparation
    And my work schedule is unpredictable and changes weekly
    When we plan shared meals
    Then the protocol should coordinate across different schedules
    And identify opportunities when I can participate
    And help distribute cooking responsibilities fairly
    And allow flexible contribution when my schedule permits
