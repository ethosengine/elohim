Scenario: Municipal care economy connects to regional and state levels
    Given Sarah's municipality successfully implements care economy
    And larger governance scales could benefit from similar approaches
    When municipal care economy is established
    Then the municipal_elohim should connect to regional systems
    And successful municipal practices should inform state policy
    And care economy should scale beyond municipal boundaries
    And Sarah's local success should contribute to broader transformation
    And municipal level should be stepping stone to larger scale change
