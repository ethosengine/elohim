    Then local food systems eliminate long-haul transportation fossil fuel use
    And businesses invest in renewable energy through community investment support
    And bioregional fossil fuel consumption decreases measurably
    And investment accelerates just energy transition
    And bioregional_elohim tracks energy transition and coordinates renewable investment
