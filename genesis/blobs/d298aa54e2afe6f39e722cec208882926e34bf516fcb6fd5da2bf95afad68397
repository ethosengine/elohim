Feature: Provincial/State-Level Constitutional Council Deliberation for Council Member
  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer
  I want to deliberate on complex regional appeals and establish precedent
  So that constitutional interpretation guides multiple communities coherently

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the constitutional_council_member user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active
    And Sarah Martinez serves her 4-month term on Regional Constitutional Council

  Scenario: Serving on Regional Council with greater complexity and time
    Given I was selected for Regional Constitutional Council
    And this layer handles escalated appeals and novel situations
    When I begin my 4-month term meeting twice weekly
    Then I review: cases that couldn't be resolved at community layer
    And I deliberate: complex constitutional questions affecting region
    And I create: precedent influencing multiple communities
    And I work with: citizens from diverse communities across region
    And I receive: enhanced training for greater responsibility
    And I am compensated: for significant time commitment
    And I feel: weight of creating regional constitutional law

  Scenario: Deliberating multi-community coordination case
    Given an appeal involves agent decisions across several communities
    And different communities have conflicting local calibrations
    When our regional council reviews the inter-community conflict
    Then we evaluate: how subsidiarity applies across boundaries
    And we examine: if regional coordination is constitutionally required
    And we consider: if local diversity should be harmonized or preserved
    And we consult: community leaders about local context
    And we establish: regional minimums while respecting variation
    And we create: precedent for multi-layer governance coherence
    And our judgment: enables communities to coordinate democratically

  Scenario: Reviewing case with significant technical complexity
    Given appeal involves cryptographic verification questions
    And I lack technical expertise to understand the details
    When Dr. Okonkwo provides expert testimony
    Then she explains: in language I can understand
    And she shows: what can and cannot be technically verified
    And she presents: competing expert interpretations
    And she informs: without advocating for particular outcome
    And I ask: questions until I understand enough to judge
    And I weigh: technical information alongside human wisdom
    And I decide: on constitutional alignment not technical optimization
    And I honor: the boundary between expertise and judgment

  Scenario: Creating novel constitutional precedent for new situation
    Given an appeal presents situation never before encountered
    And existing precedents don't clearly apply
    When we engage in deep constitutional interpretation
    Then we examine: fundamental principles and their application
    And we consider: multiple interpretations and their implications
    And we consult: technical experts about possibilities
    And we study: similar cases from other regions for insight
    And we deliberate: for extended time given novelty and stakes
    And we craft: new precedent with careful reasoning
    And we document: our constitutional analysis thoroughly
    And we create: guidance for future similar cases

  Scenario: Documenting dissenting opinion preserving minority view
    Given our council reaches majority decision on appeal
    And I disagree with the majority interpretation
    When we document the precedent
    Then my dissenting opinion: is included with full reasoning
    And I explain: alternative constitutional reading
    And I articulate: why majority may have missed important considerations
    And future councils: can reference both majority and dissent
    And constitutional evolution: can draw on minority wisdom later
    And my disagreement: is honored as legitimate democratic deliberation
    And precedent reflects: richness of constitutional debate

  Scenario: Balancing speed and deliberation quality under time pressure
    Given regional crisis creates many urgent appeals
    And we must review decisions quickly
    When we convene emergency sessions for crisis appeals
    Then we maintain: deliberation quality despite urgency
    And we evaluate: if emergency protocols were properly invoked
    And we examine: if crisis justified departures from normal process
    And we provide: expedited review within 48-72 hours
    And we avoid: rubber-stamping under pressure
    And we create: precedent for crisis governance
    And we ensure: democratic accountability even in emergencies

  Scenario: My judgment influences policy maker legislation
    Given Senator Ruiz is drafting AI governance legislation
    And she reviews our regional council precedents for insight
    When our constitutional reasoning informs her policy
    Then my citizen judgment: shapes democratic law
    And my lived experience: enriches legislative wisdom
    And my constitutional interpretation: guides government integration
    And sortition governance: and representative democracy work together
    And I contribute: to democratic governance beyond my council service
    And my voice: matters in ways I never imagined as nurse

  Scenario: Reviewing systematic bias revealed across community appeals
    Given researcher identified pattern of biased agent decisions
    And multiple similar appeals came from affected communities
    When we treat this as systemic review not individual cases
    Then we investigate: if protocol implementation has regional problems
    And we examine: if certain demographics are disadvantaged
    And we consult: researchers on the pattern data
    And we may order: regional protocol audit or recalibration
    And we address: structural injustice not just individual grievances
    And we demonstrate: constitutional accountability works at scale
    And we prevent: systemic violations through democratic oversight

  Scenario: Grappling with cultural diversity and constitutional minimums
    Given appeal involves community with different cultural practices
    And tension exists between cultural values and constitutional principles
    When we deliberate on cultural context and universal minimums
    Then we honor: legitimate cultural diversity
    And we distinguish: variation from violations of human dignity
    And we examine: if protocol accommodates cultural specificity
    And we balance: universal minimums with cultural respect
    And we avoid: both cultural imperialism and harmful relativism
    And we create: precedent protecting pluralism within constitutional bounds
    And we demonstrate: wisdom ordinary citizens bring to complex questions

  Scenario: Contributing to regional policy improvement through recommendations
    Given we identified gaps in agent protocols through appeals
    And we documented recommendations for improvement
    When community leaders and policy makers review our guidance
    Then protocol developers: implement our suggested enhancements
    And communities: consider our calibration recommendations
    And policy makers: craft legislation addressing the gaps
    And our constitutional interpretation: drives continuous improvement
    And democratic feedback loop: connects citizen oversight to systemic learning
    And my service: makes governance better for region
