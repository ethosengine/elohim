    Given developer proposes major commercial development on vacant land
    And environmental impact report prepared by developer's consultants
    And staff recommendation supports approval with mitigation measures
    When the planning commissioner requests Observer independent analysis
    Then they receive assessment of impact report methodology and limitations
    And see comparison to development impacts documented in peer jurisdictions
    And access air quality, water, and habitat impact analysis independent of developer framing
    And discover mitigation measures less effective than presented
    And independent analysis reveals environmental impacts developer report minimized
