Scenario: Board member compares district performance to jurisdictional peers
    Given board reviews annual student achievement and equity data
    And superintendent presents results emphasizing positive trends
    And board wants to understand if district is truly serving all students well
    When the board member uses Observer cross-district comparison
    Then they see district's achievement gaps larger than similar districts
    And discover other districts closed equity gaps while this one widened
    And access specific practices peer districts used to improve outcomes
    And identify areas where staff presentation masked concerning patterns
    And independent analysis helps board exercise meaningful oversight
