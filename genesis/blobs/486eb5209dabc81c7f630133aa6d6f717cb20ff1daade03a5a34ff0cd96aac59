Scenario: Supporting children's learning at home amid crisis and instability
    Given children need home learning support and homework help
    And I am traumatized, stressed, and have limited time and energy
    When I try to support children's learning despite constraints
    Then the Value Scanner provides appropriate learning support strategies
    And helps me access homework help resources (libraries, tutoring, online support)
    And suggests realistic expectations for home learning support given my capacity
    And validates that my limited bandwidth is reasonable given circumstances
    And tracks children's learning progress and needs
    And my personal_agent reminds me of important school deadlines and events
    And recognizes home learning support as valuable educational labor
    And celebrates my children's learning engagement despite crisis
