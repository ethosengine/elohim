Scenario: Supporting each other through health challenges
    Given one or both partners may face health crises
    And partners provide mutual care and support
    When the household_elohim tracks caregiving between partners
    Then it should recognize care provided by each partner
    And it should surface when care burden becomes unsustainable
    And it should suggest external support when needed
    And care between partners should be valued and visible
    And the system should protect relationship health under care stress
    And mutual care should strengthen rather than strain partnership
