Scenario: Advocating for industry training and skill development
    Given food service work involves significant skill but is undervalued
    When workers advocate for professional development and advancement paths
    Then the protocol should support advocacy for industry training programs
    And help workers demand investment in skill development
    And push for career pathways and mobility within industry
    And challenge perception of food service as unskilled disposable labor
