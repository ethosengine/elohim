Scenario: Seasonal eating aligned with bioregional food production
    Given Sarah's bioregion has seasonal food availability
    And seasonal eating reduces environmental impact and cost
    When Sarah plans meals
    Then the bioregional_elohim should suggest seasonal options
    And it should educate about bioregional growing patterns
    And it should help Sarah align purchases with local seasons
    And seasonal eating should be framed as care for place
    And bioregional awareness should shape consumption patterns
