Scenario: Intergenerational neighborhood connections maintain elder standing
    Given Helen interacts with neighbors of all ages
    And longtime residents have neighborhood wisdom
    When neighborhood governance decisions are made
    Then Helen's voice should carry weight as longtime resident
    And her knowledge of neighborhood history should inform decisions
    And younger neighbors should be connected to Helen for wisdom
    And intergenerational relationships should be facilitated
    And the neighborhood_elohim should surface opportunities for elder mentoring
    And Helen should experience continued relevance in neighborhood life
    And the protocol should maintain elder standing in community
