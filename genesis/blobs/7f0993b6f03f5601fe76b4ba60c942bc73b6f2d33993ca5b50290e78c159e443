Scenario: Family governance includes Frank's voice in his own care planning
    Given family makes decisions that affect Frank's future
    And decisions about his care must honor his autonomy
    When family_elohim facilitates governance decisions
    Then Frank must have primary voice in his own care planning
    And adult children should participate but not dominate
    And Frank's preferences and values must be centered
    And family should plan with him, not for him
    And his decades of life experience should be respected
    And autonomy should be preserved even as needs increase
    And family governance should empower, never infantilize
