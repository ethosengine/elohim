Scenario: Citizen connects municipal decisions to school impacts
    Given a developer proposes 200-unit residential complex
    And claims it will benefit the tax base
    When the Observer calculates educational impacts
    Then the citizen sees 180 new students projected
    And understands infrastructure capacity constraints
    And learns no new school facilities are planned
    And connects municipal development to education quality
    And cross-domain impacts become visible
