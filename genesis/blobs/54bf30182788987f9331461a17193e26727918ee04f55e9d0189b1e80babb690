Scenario: Teacher reports curriculum concerns anonymously
    Given the principal mandates instructional approach contradicting research
    And the teacher knows this won't work for students
    When the teacher reports concern through Observer anonymously
    Then the contribution is documented without revealing identity
    And pattern detection shows 45 other teachers share concern
    And school leadership sees collective professional judgment
    And curriculum decision is reconsidered based on teacher expertise
    And teacher voice emerges without individual retaliation risk
