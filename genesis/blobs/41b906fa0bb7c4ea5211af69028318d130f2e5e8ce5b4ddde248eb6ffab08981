Scenario: Contributing to community education about care work
    Given many people don't recognize labor as care contribution
    When I want to help community understand care economy
    Then the protocol should help me share my perspective as a worker
    And support education about care work embedded in all labor
    And facilitate community consciousness-raising
    And build movement toward care-economy-aligned economics
