Scenario: Neighborhood resources coordinated to support Alex's participation
    Given Alex may need specific support to participate in neighborhood activities
    And neighborhood has resources that could help
    When Alex wants to engage in neighborhood events or projects
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate needed support
    And neighbors might provide transportation, physical assistance, or other help
    And support should be reciprocal within mutual aid framework
    And Alex should not experience this as charity or burden
    And resource coordination should enable participation
    And the protocol should facilitate Alex's full neighborhood engagement
    And access barriers should be solved collectively, not individually
