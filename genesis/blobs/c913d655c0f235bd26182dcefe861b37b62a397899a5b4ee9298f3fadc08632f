Scenario: Farm knowledge transfer becomes systematic institutional practice
    Given Tom's knowledge was concentrated in his experience and tacit expertise
    And knowledge loss would occur if he exited without systematic transfer
    When democratic conversion requires knowledge documentation
    Then Tom's expertise is systematically documented and shared with worker-owners
    And apprenticeship programs formalize knowledge transfer to new farmworkers
    And institutional memory develops preventing knowledge loss through turnover
    And democratic governance ensures continuous learning and knowledge circulation
    And workplace_elohim manages knowledge transfer protocols and documentation
