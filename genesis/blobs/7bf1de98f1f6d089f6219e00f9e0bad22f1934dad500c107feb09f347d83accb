Scenario: Disability justice insights inform ecological care economy
    Given disability justice recognizes that no one is truly independent
    And disabled people understand interdependence as lived reality
    When the bioregional_elohim models ecological relationships
    Then disability justice principles should inform ecological thinking
    And Alex's understanding of mutual aid should shape environmental approaches
    And recognition of diverse ways of being should extend to ecological diversity
    And interdependence should be celebrated, not denied
    And the protocol should learn from disability community wisdom
    And ecological systems should embody values disability justice teaches
    And Alex's expertise about interdependence should be valued
