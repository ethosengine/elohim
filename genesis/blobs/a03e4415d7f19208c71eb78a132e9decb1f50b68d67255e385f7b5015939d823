Scenario: Privacy control over multigenerational care data
    Given Margaret's data includes information about grandchildren and her mother
    And health information is particularly sensitive
    When Margaret determines data sharing preferences
    Then she must have complete control over all her data
    And she should choose what's shared with family members
    And she can demonstrate care value to family if she wishes
    And she can maintain complete privacy if she prefers
    And health data sharing must be explicitly consented
    And Margaret's autonomy over her information must be absolute
    And privacy across generations must be carefully managed
