    And I collaborate: with Global South technical experts
    And I resist: digital colonialism in technical design
    And I demonstrate: that technical standards can honor diversity

  Scenario: Peer reviewing global expert testimony across cultures
    Given experts from diverse technical traditions advise convention
    And peer review must work across different epistemologies
    When I review testimony from non-Western technical expert
    Then I respect: different approaches to technical knowledge
    And I identify: complementary insights from diverse perspectives
    And I avoid: dismissing unfamiliar technical traditions
    And I learn: from different ways of understanding AI systems
    And I strengthen: testimony through cross-cultural dialogue
    And I demonstrate: epistemic humility and global collaboration

  Scenario: Collaborating with Dr. Chen on global sortition research
    Given Dr. Chen presents research on constitutional council effectiveness
    And my technical expertise complements his social science
    When I help explain technical aspects of his findings
    Then I clarify: how technical design enables or constrains democratic oversight
    And I interpret: patterns in agent-council interactions
    And I assess: whether technical systems adequately support citizen governance
    And I respect: his authority on democratic theory and outcomes
    And we integrate: technical and social understanding
    And we serve: evidence-based global constitutional deliberation
    And we demonstrate: interdisciplinary collaboration

  Scenario: Explaining attack vectors from authoritarian and corporate actors
    Given global protocol faces threats from powerful adversaries
    And delegates need to understand vulnerabilities
    When I present threat assessment to convention
    Then I explain: how authoritarian regimes might compromise agents
    And I describe: corporate strategies for regulatory capture
    And I assess: resilience of distributed architecture
    And I present: defense mechanisms and their limitations
    And I avoid: either creating panic or false confidence
