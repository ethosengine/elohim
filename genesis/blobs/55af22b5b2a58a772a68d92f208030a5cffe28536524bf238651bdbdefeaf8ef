Scenario: Community advocacy elevates single parent issues to policy level
    Given single parents face systemic barriers and lack political visibility
    And policy changes could dramatically improve their circumstances
    When Maria participates in community advocacy
    Then the community_elohim should amplify single parent voices
    And it should provide care economy data showing scale of solo parent contributions
    And it should help Maria advocate for single-parent-friendly policies
    And community should recognize single parents as care economy heroes, not broken families
    And advocacy should push for systemic changes in housing, childcare, wages, and support
