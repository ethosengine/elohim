Scenario: Multigenerational care coordination across distributed family
    Given Robert's parents live in Florida
    And his children attend college in different states
    And his grandchild occasionally needs care
    And Robert's siblings share parent care responsibilities
    When family_elohim coordinates care across geography
    Then it should track care needs across multiple households
    And coordinate with Robert's siblings on parent care distribution
    And help Robert support his children remotely
    And manage occasional grandchild care
    And surface conflicts across generational needs
    And provide sophisticated coordination across distance
    And ensure no household or person is overwhelmed
