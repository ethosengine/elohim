Scenario: Journalist fact-checks regional economic development claims
    Given county officials tout major economic development success
    And claim massive job creation and tax revenue
    When the Observer analyzes economic development outcomes
    Then the journalist verifies jobs created are lower-wage than promised
    And finds tax incentives cost more than revenue generated
    And sees environmental violations and labor law violations
    And tracks development firm's record in other regions
    And publishes accountability story on corporate welfare
    And instant research exposes exaggerated claims
