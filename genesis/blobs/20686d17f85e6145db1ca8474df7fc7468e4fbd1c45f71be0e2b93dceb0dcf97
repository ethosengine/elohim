Scenario: Democratic distribution cooperative emerges providing logistics without extraction
    Given some distribution infrastructure is useful (aggregation, transportation, storage)
    And corporate distributors provide this but extract massively beyond cost
    When democratic network creates worker-owned distribution cooperative
    Then logistics services are provided at cost-recovery, not profit maximization
    And distribution workers gain ownership and democratic governance
    And necessary functions are preserved without extraction
    And democratic cooperative proves distribution infrastructure can be democratically operated
