Scenario: Council member faces developer donation pressure with transparency
    Given the politician received campaign contributions from developers
    And developer seeks vote on controversial project
    When the Observer documents the relationship publicly
    Then they see their campaign finance connections made visible
    And understand constituents can track voting patterns
    And face accountability for aligning votes with donors versus community
    And navigate pressure with transparent decision-making
    And explain vote rationale with evidence regardless of decision
