Scenario: Owner receives emotional support for ownership loss grief
    Given letting go of business is genuine grief and identity crisis
    And capitalist culture offers no support for this transition
    When EAE provides transition support
    Then Rosa accesses peer support groups with other converted owners
    And Rosa receives therapy for processing ownership loss
    And Rosa's emotional reality is validated and supported
    And transition support recognizes this as major life change requiring care
