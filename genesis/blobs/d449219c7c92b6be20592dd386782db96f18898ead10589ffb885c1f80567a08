Scenario: Parent evaluates school board candidates
    Given three candidates are running for school board seats
    And the parent has limited time to research before the election
    When the parent reviews Observer's candidate analysis
    Then they see each candidate's voting record on key issues
    And view candidates' positions on class sizes and program funding
    And understand which candidates prioritize student needs vs politics
    And can make informed voting decision in 15 minutes
    And democracy extends to education governance elections
