Scenario: Emergency preparedness accounts for Alex's specific needs
    Given Alex has disability-related emergency considerations
    And emergencies require rapid response
    When the household_elohim plans for emergency scenarios
    Then emergency plans should account for Alex's mobility limitations
    And evacuation plans should be accessible to Alex
    And medical equipment needs should be factored into emergency supplies
    And support worker backup plans should be established
    And Alex should have accessible emergency communication methods
    And emergency preparedness should reduce Alex's vulnerability
    And planning should be proactive, not reactive
