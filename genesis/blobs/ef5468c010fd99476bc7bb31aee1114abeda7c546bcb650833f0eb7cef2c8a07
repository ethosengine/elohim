Scenario: Teacher advocates for professional development reform
    Given state mandates professional development hours annually
    But current PD is generic and unhelpful for actual teaching
    When teachers provide evidence on PD effectiveness through Observer
    Then aggregated data shows teachers rate 80% of PD as not useful
    And teachers propose evidence-based PD reform based on what actually helps
    And document successful PD models from other states
    And coordinate with education researchers and reform advocates
    And state professional development policy respects teacher expertise
