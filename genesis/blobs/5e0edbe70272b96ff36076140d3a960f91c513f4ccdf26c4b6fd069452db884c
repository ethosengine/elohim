Scenario: Stress and burnout monitoring with proactive intervention
    Given Robert carries enormous care burden across contexts
    And middle-aged adults often experience burnout
    And he may not recognize his own exhaustion
    When his personal_agent monitors stress indicators
    Then it should track signs of burnout across his activities
    And recognize patterns: "You've canceled personal activities 8 consecutive weeks"
    And flag when burden becomes unsustainable
    And proactively surface support resources
    And connect him to respite care, counseling, or community support
    And validate that asking for help is strength, not weakness
    And intervene before burnout becomes crisis
