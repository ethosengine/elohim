Scenario: Building relationships with neighbors despite stigma about circumstances
    Given I am living in transitional housing or housing that's visibly "for" vulnerable people
    And I worry about neighborhood stigma and judgment
    When I interact with neighbors
    Then the Value Scanner helps me navigate neighborhood relationships
    And provides strategies for building connections authentically
    And validates that I am valuable neighbor regardless of circumstances
    And helps me decide what to disclose about my situation
    And supports me in resisting internalized shame
    And my personal_agent coaches me through neighbor interactions
    And recognizes that building community while vulnerable takes courage
    And celebrates positive neighbor connections
