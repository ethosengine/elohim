# Young Adult - Value Scanner

## Archetype

Aisha is 23 years old, living in her first solo apartment after college, working her first full-time job, and navigating the overwhelming complexity of adult economic life. She uses the Value Scanner to manage her grocery budget ($200/month—tight but manageable on her $38k salary), learn to cook, track nutrition while living alone, and stay connected to her family's care economy practices. Her personal_agent helps her build household management skills her college education never taught: meal planning on a budget, reducing food waste, balancing nutrition with cost, and building sustainable shopping habits. She's also accumulating care tokens for helping her younger siblings with homework remotely and contributing to her parents' household during visits home.

Aisha represents the Early Independence phase (ages 18-25) of the Value Scanner epic—the jarring transition from embedded family life to independent adult responsibility. She's discovering that adult life requires sophisticated care economy skills: feeding herself, managing resources, maintaining health, coordinating across work and life, and staying connected to family while building independence. The Value Scanner provides continuity from her teenage care economy participation into adult self-sufficiency, while connecting her to new contexts (workplace, neighborhood, broader community).

What distinguishes Aisha from both teens and established adults is this particular vulnerability: she has adult responsibility without established resources or fully developed capability. She's learning by doing, often making expensive mistakes. The protocol serves her by scaffolding her development—providing tools, information, and connection that help her build adult competence without the traditional "figure it out alone" struggle. She's also navigating competing demands on her care capacity: establishing her own household while remaining connected to family needs, building professional capability while maintaining personal well-being.

## Core Needs

- **Practical Adult Life Skills**: Aisha needs to learn household management skills that formal education didn't teach. How to grocery shop efficiently, plan meals, reduce waste, cook nutritious food on a budget, maintain nutrition when time-constrained. Her personal_agent serves as a patient teacher—suggesting recipes based on what she has, flagging when nutrition is slipping, helping her learn from mistakes (bought too much fresh produce and it spoiled? Agent suggests smaller quantities or frozen alternatives). She's building capabilities essential to adult flourishing.

- **Financial Sustainability on Entry-Level Income**: Aisha's $38k salary requires careful resource management, especially in an expensive urban area. She needs sophisticated budgeting tools that help her balance immediate needs (food, rent, transportation) with future goals (student loan repayment, savings, occasional family support). The Value Scanner helps her find the efficiency frontiers—maximum nutrition per dollar, strategic shopping across multiple stores, identifying where spending more actually saves money (quality items that last vs. cheap items that break). She's learning adult financial management through practice with good decision support.

- **Connection to Family Care Economy**: Aisha wants to stay connected to her family's care economy participation even as she establishes independence. The Value Scanner allows her to contribute remotely—helping siblings with homework, participating in family decisions, sending care tokens to support household needs. When she visits home, her care contributions (cooking, shopping, household help) are recognized. The protocol maintains family bonds through visible reciprocal care rather than just emotional ties. She's learning that adult independence doesn't mean abandoning family care networks.

- **Building Professional Identity While Maintaining Wholeness**: Aisha's workplace demands are substantial—long hours, intense expectations, professional development pressures. She needs tools that help her maintain personal well-being while building career capability. The Value Scanner helps her see that caring for herself (nutrition, rest, sustainability) is care work that enables her professional contributions. Her personal_agent might flag: "You've worked through lunch four days this week—your energy is probably suffering." She's learning that professional success requires personal stewardship.

- **Community Connection in New Context**: Aisha moved to a new city for work and needs to build community from scratch. The Value Scanner can connect her to neighborhood and community care economy networks—meeting others who shop at similar stores, sharing resources (bulk buying, meal prep groups, knowledge exchange), participating in local care economy initiatives. She's learning that community isn't just where you grew up—it's something you build through care relationships wherever you are.

## Key Relationships

**To Family of Origin**: Aisha maintains active care relationships with her family despite geographic distance. She contributes care tokens to family resources, helps siblings remotely, participates in family governance discussions via technology, and provides substantial care labor during visits home. The family_elohim coordinates across distance—her parents see her contributions, her siblings can request help, and family care patterns continue even as Aisha establishes independence. She's learning that adult family relationships involve reciprocal care, not just childhood dependency.

**To Personal Agent**: Aisha's personal_agent functions as life skills teacher, financial advisor, health monitor, and connection coordinator. It's helping her build adult capabilities she needs but doesn't yet have. Their relationship is collaborative—Aisha sets goals, the agent provides information and tools to achieve them. She's learning to use AI as a genuine partner in capability development, not a crutch that prevents learning.

**To Workplace/Employer**: Aisha's workplace is her first experience of professional care economy. The workplace_elohim could help her understand her labor contributions' value, recognize when workplace demands become unsustainable, negotiate for fair compensation, and build professional capabilities. She's learning to apply care economy principles to employment: her work is care labor (contributing to organizational flourishing), and she deserves care in return (fair pay, healthy conditions, development opportunities).

**To Neighborhood**: Aisha is discovering her new neighborhood through care economy participation. She shops at local stores, attends community events, participates in neighborhood initiatives. The neighborhood_elohim might surface opportunities: "A meal prep group is forming nearby—joining would reduce your time pressure and build community connections." She's learning that neighborhoods function as mutual care networks when residents actively participate.

**To Peer Networks**: Aisha's friendships increasingly involve care economy dimensions—coordinating shopping, sharing resources, exchanging knowledge, providing mutual support. The Value Scanner facilitates peer-to-peer care economy: sharing bulk purchases, trading care tokens for mutual help, coordinating community participation. She's learning that adult friendships involve practical reciprocal care, not just social enjoyment.

**To Romantic Partner**: (If applicable) Aisha might be navigating care economy within romantic relationships—coordinating household labor, managing shared resources, negotiating values and practices. The Value Scanner could help couples build equitable care distributions, make household economics visible, and practice joint stewardship. She's learning that healthy adult partnerships require care economy literacy.

## Relevant Governance Layers

### Geographic/Political

**Individual Layer**
Aisha exercises full adult autonomy—economic decisions, lifestyle choices, value formation, life direction. Her personal_agent serves her individual flourishing without controlling her choices. She's actively forming adult identity and building capability for lifelong self-governance.

**Household Layer**
If Aisha lives alone, household and individual layers largely overlap. If she has roommates, household governance involves coordinating shared resources, distributing household labor, and maintaining shared spaces. The Value Scanner could help roommate households function as miniature care economies—tracking contributions, coordinating needs, maintaining equity.

**Family Layer**
Aisha participates in her origin family's governance from a distance, now as an independent adult rather than a dependent child. Her voice in family decisions carries equal weight to other adults'. Her care contributions are recognized and valued. She's learning how families adapt when adult children establish independence while maintaining care bonds.

**Neighborhood Layer**
Aisha is building participation in her new neighborhood—learning local patterns, contributing to community initiatives, benefiting from collective resources. She's discovering how neighborhoods coordinate care and how her participation strengthens local resilience.

**Community Layer**
Aisha engages community-level care economy as an independent adult—accessing resources based on contribution, participating in governance structures, building relationships with community institutions. She's establishing her adult position in community networks.

### Functional

**Workplace/Organizational Layer**
Aisha's workplace is a major governance context—shaping her time, energy, economic resources, and professional identity. She's learning to navigate workplace governance, understand her position in organizational hierarchies, and advocate for care economy principles in employment contexts.

**Educational Layer**
Aisha might be pursuing continuing education, professional development, or skill-building. She's learning that education doesn't end with formal schooling—that adult life involves continuous learning. The Value Scanner might surface educational resources aligned with her interests and goals.

**Ecological/Bioregional Layer**
As an independent consumer, Aisha's choices directly affect ecological systems. She's learning to make consumption decisions that balance cost, nutrition, and environmental impact. Her personal_agent helps her understand trade-offs and build sustainable practices within her budget constraints.

## Implementation Notes

- **Technical**: Interface should support independent adult life—sophisticated budgeting and meal planning tools, nutrition tracking, waste reduction analytics, multi-store comparison, recipe suggestions based on ingredients and skills, connection to community resources. Mobile-first for on-the-go access. Integration with bank accounts and budgeting apps. Personal_agent should function as comprehensive life management support system.

- **Privacy**: Full adult privacy controls. Aisha determines what data is shared with whom. Family might see care contributions she chooses to share, but she maintains privacy over financial details, personal choices, and life decisions. Workplace doesn't access personal data. Community connections require her explicit consent. She's managing privacy as a full adult with complete control.

- **Interface**: Design for capable but learning adult. Clear information display, powerful comparison and analysis tools, educational resources integrated seamlessly. Recognition of care contributions should feel genuine and meaningful. Interface should reduce cognitive load (life is complex) while building capability. Aesthetic should feel adult—professional, clean, respectful.

- **Constraints**: Safety nets shift from parental oversight to institutional support. If Aisha encounters crisis (job loss, health emergency, financial collapse), the protocol should connect her to appropriate resources—community support networks, institutional assistance, professional services. Support should preserve dignity and autonomy while providing genuine help.

- **Opportunities**: Young adults are navigating a transition that's historically been unnecessarily difficult—sudden full responsibility without adequate preparation or support. The Value Scanner can smooth this transition by providing continuity from family care economy participation into independent adult life. If young adults learn sophisticated care economy practices early, they build patterns that will serve them throughout life. This age group is also highly connected to peers—viral spread of care economy practices among young adults could rapidly shift broader cultural patterns. Aisha's generation could establish care economy as normal adult practice, transforming how society thinks about household economics, work-life balance, and community care.
