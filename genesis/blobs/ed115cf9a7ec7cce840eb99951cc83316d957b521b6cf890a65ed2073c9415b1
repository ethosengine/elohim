Scenario: Adult's complex scheduling requires sophisticated coordination
    Given Sarah manages professional schedule, children's schedules, household tasks, community commitments
    And conflicts arise constantly
    When Sarah plans her week
    Then the personal_agent should integrate with calendars, school systems, work tools
    And it should identify scheduling conflicts automatically
    And it should suggest realistic solutions within constraints
    And it should coordinate across family members' needs
    And scheduling should support Sarah's effectiveness, not overwhelm her
