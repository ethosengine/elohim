Scenario: Accessing community resources based on care contributions
    Given I contribute significantly to community through my labor
    And community has food banks, meal programs, and mutual aid resources
    When I need support due to low wages or difficult circumstances
    Then the protocol should connect me to community resources
    And help me access support with dignity (not charity but reciprocity)
    And recognize that I have standing based on my care contributions
    And facilitate care economy where workers are supported by the community they serve
