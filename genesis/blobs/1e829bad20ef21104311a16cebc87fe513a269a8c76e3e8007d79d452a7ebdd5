Scenario: Municipal accountability to care economy principles
    Given Robert and others participate in municipal care economy
    And municipalities should be accountable to care principles
    And municipal decisions affect care economy functioning
    When municipal_elohim monitors municipal accountability
    Then it should track whether municipal policy supports care economy
    And surface when municipal decisions harm caregivers
    And help Robert hold municipality accountable to care principles
    And provide tools for monitoring municipal care economy performance
    And support resident advocacy for accountability
    And build municipal governance that serves care economy
    And demonstrate that municipalities should be accountable to residents' care needs
