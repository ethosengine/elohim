Scenario: Activist identifies developer's cross-jurisdiction pattern
    Given a developer is proposing controversial project
    And uses familiar tactics from other campaigns
    When the Observer tracks developer across municipalities

    And views track record of community promises vs delivery
    And identifies political relationships and campaign donations
    And systematic exploitation becomes undeniable
    And activists coordinate across jurisdictions
