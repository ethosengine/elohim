Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Child
  As a child in the value scanner system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to be recognized as a junior contributor to family flourishing
  So that I experience my role shifting from dependent to capable family member

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the child user "Emma" is registered in the system
    And Emma is 8 years old
    And Emma is part of a family unit with parent Sarah and brother Tommy (5)
    And the family household income is $40,000/year
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim is coordinating family care economy
    And Emma's personal_agent communicates with family_elohim

  Scenario: Child's substantive care contributions visible to family
    Given Emma has made budget-conscious cereal choice
    And she selected store brand to save $2
    When the family_elohim processes the contribution
    Then Emma's stewardship should be visible on family dashboard
    And parent Sarah should receive specific recognition prompts
    And the prompt should highlight Emma's economic reasoning
    And the contribution should be attributed with concrete impact
    And family care tokens should reflect genuine value created
    And visibility should enable meaningful parental acknowledgment

  Scenario: Shifting from dependent to junior contributor role
    Given Emma has increasing capability at age 8
    And her family role is evolving
    When Emma makes care contributions through the scanner
    Then she should be recognized as junior contributor, not just helper
    And her voice in family decisions should carry real weight
    And the family_elohim should track her growing capability
    And Sarah should be supported in granting appropriate autonomy
    And Emma should experience increasing responsibility
    And family dynamics should reflect her developmental transition

  Scenario: Coordinating care work with younger sibling
    Given Emma's brother Tommy is 5 years old
    And Emma sometimes helps Tommy make choices
    When Emma assists Tommy in the Value Scanner
    Then her teaching and support should be recognized as care work
    And the family_elohim should track sibling care patterns
    And Emma should learn that helping others is valuable contribution
    And Tommy should benefit from Emma's greater capability
    And cross-generational care should be made visible
    And Emma should build identity as both care receiver and care provider

  Scenario: Family budget constraints shape real economic learning
    Given the family income is $40,000/year
    And Emma is learning genuine resource constraint
    When Emma makes purchasing decisions
    Then her personal_agent should provide real budget information
    And the agent should say "We have $30 left for groceries this week"
    And Emma should experience actual financial limits
    And her choices should have real impact on family resources
    And she should learn stewardship through authentic constraint
    And economic education should reflect family's actual circumstances

  Scenario: Child influences family values while family shapes child
    Given Emma is forming her own values at age 8
    And family values still primarily guide her
    When Emma suggests trying new products or priorities
    Then the family_elohim should track her value proposals
    And Sarah should receive prompts to consider Emma's input
    And Emma's voice should genuinely influence family decisions
    And bidirectional value formation should occur
    And Emma should experience being heard in family governance
    And family culture should evolve with children's input

  Scenario: Earning increased autonomy through demonstrated stewardship
    Given Emma has shown good judgment over time
    And parents can adjust boundaries through family_elohim
    When Emma's decision patterns demonstrate capability
    Then Sarah should be prompted to expand Emma's freedom
    And specific areas for increased autonomy should be suggested
    And Emma should understand connection between responsibility and freedom
    And the family should have clear process for granting trust
    And autonomy should be earned through demonstrated care
    And family governance should respond to growing capability

  Scenario: Family care token economy includes child contributions
    Given the family participates in care token system
    And Emma makes multiple types of care contributions
    When family care tokens are calculated weekly
    Then Emma's economic decisions should generate tokens
    And her care for Tommy should be valued
    And her household contributions should be recognized
    And tokens should reflect genuine value created
    And Emma should have age-appropriate awareness of her economic impact
    And care token distribution should teach that care creates value

  Scenario: Sibling care relationships built through mutual recognition
    Given Emma cares for Tommy and Tommy cares for Emma
    And both children make care contributions
    When the family_elohim tracks sibling interactions
    Then reciprocal care patterns should be highlighted
    And Emma should be prompted to recognize Tommy's care for her
    And Tommy should be prompted to recognize Emma's help
    And the family should see mutual care, not hierarchy
    And positive feedback loops should strengthen sibling bonds
    And care economy should build family relationships

  Scenario: Parental oversight balances with expanding child autonomy
    Given Emma has more freedom than Tommy
    And she still needs parental guidance at age 8
    When Emma makes independent scanner decisions
    Then Sarah should have full visibility into Emma's choices
    And Sarah should maintain ultimate authority
    And Emma's autonomy should be genuine within parental bounds
    And the balance should protect both safety and capability development
    And Sarah should be supported in letting go appropriately
    And trust should grow as Emma demonstrates judgment

  Scenario: Family shopping as collaborative care experience
    Given Emma and Sarah shop together
    And they both use the Value Scanner
    When they coordinate on family purchasing decisions
    Then Emma should be learning from Sarah's modeling
    And Sarah should be teaching through real decision-making
    And the family_elohim should coordinate their different roles
    And Emma's contributions should be recognized alongside Sarah's
    And shopping should be experienced as family care work
    And collaborative decision-making should strengthen relationship

  Scenario: Child's care work saves family money with real impact
    Given the family has tight budget constraints
    And Emma chooses cost-effective options consistently
    When Emma's choices accumulate over time
    Then actual savings should be calculated and visible
    And Emma should see concrete impact: "Your choices saved $47 this month"
    And the family should be able to allocate savings to other needs
    And Emma's stewardship should have measurable benefit
    And economic contribution should be recognized as genuine help
    And she should understand her agency affects family flourishing

  Scenario: Family cultural values shape child's economic reasoning
    Given Emma's family has specific cultural framework
    And these values are configured in family_elohim
    When Emma makes value decisions
    Then guidance should align with family cultural context
    And her personal_agent should reinforce family values
    And economic literacy should be culturally appropriate
    And the protocol should serve family's chosen framework
    And diverse family cultures should be respected
    And value formation should honor family identity
