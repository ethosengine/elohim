Scenario: Environmental impact visible in consumption decisions
    Given Sarah wants to minimize environmental harm
    And impact information is often hidden from consumers
    When Sarah scans products
    Then the bioregional_elohim should display environmental impact data
    And it should show carbon footprint, water use, soil health, biodiversity effects
    And it should make ecological costs visible alongside monetary costs
    And Sarah should make informed choices about environmental impact
    And visibility should enable environmentally conscious consumption
