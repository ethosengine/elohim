Feature: Education Justice Advocacy for Activist
  As an activist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to fight for equitable education and challenge segregation
  So that all students get quality education regardless of race or class

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the educational governance context is active

  Scenario: Activist exposes systematic school resource inequities
    Given the activist campaigns for education equity
    And suspects systematic under-resourcing of schools serving students of color
    When the Observer analyzes district resource distribution
    Then the activist sees experienced teachers concentrate in white affluent schools
    And gifted programs and AP courses cluster in privileged areas
    And facility quality and maintenance vary by neighborhood
    And per-student spending disparities reach thousands of dollars
    And segregation pattern becomes legally actionable

  Scenario: Activist challenges school closure targeting Black neighborhoods
    Given the district proposes closing schools for "efficiency"
    And the activist suspects racial targeting
    When the Observer analyzes closure patterns across time
    Then the activist sees schools in Black neighborhoods systematically closed
    And white neighborhood schools remain open despite similar enrollment
    And "efficiency" rationale masks structural racism
    And community organizes opposition with documented evidence
    And racist policy becomes undeniable and challengeable

  Scenario: Activist fights harmful discipline policies
    Given suspension and expulsion rates seem racially disparate
    And the activist advocates for restorative justice
    When the Observer tracks discipline outcomes by race
    Then the activist shows Black students suspended at 3x rate
    And for same behaviors as white students who receive warnings
    And zero-tolerance policies fuel school-to-prison pipeline
    And presents evidence-based alternatives from other districts
    And policy reform campaign gains statistical backbone

  Scenario: Activist demands equitable school funding formula
    Given state funding formula creates massive district disparities
    And the activist works on statewide education justice
    When the Observer calculates funding gaps and impacts
    Then the activist shows low-income districts receive $3000 less per student
    And demonstrates impact on class sizes and programs
    And connects families in underfunded districts statewide
    And builds coalition for funding formula reform
    And structural inequity becomes focus of political campaign

  Scenario: Activist exposes charter school segregation and under-performance
    Given charter schools claim to serve disadvantaged students
    But the activist sees segregation and selective enrollment
    When the Observer tracks charter school demographics and outcomes
    Then the activist shows charters are more segregated than district schools
    And suspension rates for Black students are even higher
    And test score gains evaporate when controlling for selective enrollment
    And charter expansion drains resources from district schools
    And privatization agenda meets evidence-based critique
