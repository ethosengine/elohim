Scenario: Operator processes identity shift from franchise owner to liberated participant
    Given James's identity was tied to franchise ownership despite its burden
    And exit could trigger identity crisis and sense of failure
    When EAE provides transition support for psychological and social adjustment
    Then James accesses peer counseling with other converted franchise operators
    And new identity emerges: operator who chose workers and community over corporate servitude
    And he discovers purpose beyond ownership—contribution without extraction
    And transition is honored as wisdom and courage, not failure
    And emotional reality of major life change is validated and supported
