Scenario: School curriculum integration supports value literacy
    Given Emma's school may integrate Value Scanner data
    And educational layer includes formal learning contexts
    When Emma's anonymized scanner data is shared with school (with family permission)
    Then data should support curriculum in nutrition, math, social studies
    And learning should be reinforced across contexts
    And family permission should be required for school integration
    And Emma's privacy should be protected in educational use
    And formal education should complement experiential learning
    And value literacy should be built across multiple contexts
