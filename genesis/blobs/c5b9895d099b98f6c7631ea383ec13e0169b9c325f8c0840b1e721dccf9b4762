Scenario: Bioregional climate resilience increases through democratic economy investment
    Given climate disruption threatens communities and ecosystems
    And Patricia wants investment supporting adaptation and resilience
    When community investment prioritizes climate-resilient enterprises
    Then democratic farms implement drought-resistant crops and water conservation
    And local food systems reduce vulnerability to supply chain disruptions
    And bioregional economic resilience strengthens through democratic coordination
    And investment builds climate adaptation capacity
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates climate resilience investment and planning
