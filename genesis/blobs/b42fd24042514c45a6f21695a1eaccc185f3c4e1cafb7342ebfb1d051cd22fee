Scenario: Maintaining decision-making authority during crisis intervention
    Given I am experiencing a housing crisis
    And multiple support agencies want to "help" me
    When I express my preferences for how I want to resolve the situation
    Then the Value Scanner supports MY chosen path
    And does not override my decisions with institutional preferences
    And tracks my decision-making as evidence of my capability
    And connects me to resources that respect my autonomy
    And my personal_agent advocates for my choices in institutional contexts
    And the system recognizes that I am the expert on my own life
    And support is offered as scaffolding, not control
    And my agency is preserved even while I'm receiving assistance
