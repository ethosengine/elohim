Scenario: Building worker power through industry-wide organizing
    Given individual workers and workplaces have limited power
    When workers organize across the industry
    Then the protocol should facilitate industry-wide organizing
    And support union drives and worker organization formation
    And coordinate collective action across workplaces
    And build worker power sufficient to transform industry conditions
