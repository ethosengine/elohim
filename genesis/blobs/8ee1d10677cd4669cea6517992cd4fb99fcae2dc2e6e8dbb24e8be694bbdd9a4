Scenario: Legislator faces donor pressure with transparency and accountability
    Given the politician received campaign contributions from industry
    And industry lobbyists seek favorable vote on regulation
    When the Observer documents relationship and voting patterns
    Then they see campaign finance connections made publicly visible
    And understand constituents track alignment of votes with donors
    And face accountability for voting with industry versus constituents
    And explain votes with policy rationale not donor influence
    And navigate pressure with transparent evidence-based decision-making
