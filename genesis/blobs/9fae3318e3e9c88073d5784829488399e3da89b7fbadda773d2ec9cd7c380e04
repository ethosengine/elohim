Scenario: Appellant testimony influences national policy legislation
    Given my appeal established important national constitutional precedent
    And Senator Ruiz is drafting national AI governance legislation
    When she invites me to testify about my appeal experience
    Then I share lived experience of exercising constitutional recourse
    And I explain how appeal process protected my dignity
    And I describe remaining gaps and needed improvements
    And My testimony humanizes abstract constitutional principles
    And Policy makers understand governance through appellant eyes
    And Legislation better serves actual people because of my voice
    And Democratic policy making includes those most affected
