Scenario: Emergency response configured to Helen's advance directives
    Given emergency situations may occur in Helen's household
    And Helen has specific wishes about medical intervention
    When emergency protocols are configured
    Then her advance directives should guide emergency response
    And emergency contacts should understand her wishes
    And the household_elohim should communicate her preferences to responders
    And her values should be respected even in crisis
    And emergency systems should serve her autonomy, not override it
    And her voice should remain authoritative about her own care
    And the protocol should ensure her wishes guide all household emergency response
