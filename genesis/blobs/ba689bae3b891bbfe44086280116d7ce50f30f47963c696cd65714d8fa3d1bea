Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates regional housing contribution
    Given a developer builds affordable housing across the region
    And wants regional approval bodies to recognize consistent track record
    When the Observer surfaces regional development patterns
    Then the developer shows: 600 affordable units built across five municipalities
    And demonstrates 85% occupancy by local workforce
    And proves commitment to regional affordability not just luxury development
    And regional reputation supports new project approvals
    And consistent value creation becomes visible at scale
