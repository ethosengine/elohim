Scenario: Manager's community visibility shifts from corporate enforcer to democratic participant
    Given Marcus was previously invisible corporate manager
    And community only saw corporate brand, not individual manager
    When democratic conversion makes governance visible
    Then community knows Marcus as democratic coordinator, not owner or boss
    And community sees him at stakeholder meetings, farmers markets, neighborhood events
    And community recognizes him as community member serving institution
    And his role transformation from extraction to service becomes community narrative
    And community_elohim helps tell story of individual and structural transformation
