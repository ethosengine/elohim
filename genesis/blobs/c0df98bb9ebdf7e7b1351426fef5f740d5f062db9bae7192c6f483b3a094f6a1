Scenario: Financial literacy education grounded in real practice
    Given Jasmine manages real budgets and makes real economic decisions
    And school provides financial literacy education
    When educational_elohim integrates school learning with lived experience
    Then abstract financial concepts should connect to her real practice
    And she should learn budgeting through managing actual household budget
    And understand compound interest through her real college savings
    And learn financial planning by making real financial plans
    And develop sophisticated financial capability through practice, not just theory
    And integrate formal education with applied learning
