Scenario: Recognizing invisible family care labor
    Given I provide emotional support, communication, and coordination
    Even when I cannot provide hands-on care
    When family members track care contributions
    Then the protocol should recognize all forms of care work
    And make visible my emotional labor and communication work
    And validate that staying connected is valuable care contribution
    And ensure I am not invisibilized due to employment constraints
