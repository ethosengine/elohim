Scenario: Learning meal planning without formal training
    Given Aisha has minimal cooking experience
    And she wants to eat nutritiously on a tight budget
    When Aisha requests meal planning assistance
    Then the personal_agent should suggest recipes based on her skill level
    And recommendations should optimize nutrition per dollar
    And the system should consider ingredients she already has
    And the agent should teach cooking skills progressively
    And meal plans should fit her time constraints
    And the interface should feel like a patient teacher, not a critic
