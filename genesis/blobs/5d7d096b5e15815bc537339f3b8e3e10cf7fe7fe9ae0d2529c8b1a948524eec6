Scenario: Manager's personal growth shifts from extraction efficiency to facilitation effectiveness
    Given corporate measured Marcus's success by labor cost minimization
    And his career growth meant managing more extraction at larger scale
    When he transitions to democratic coordinator
    Then his growth trajectory shifts to facilitation skill development
    And he learns consensus-building, conflict mediation, transparent communication
    And his expertise becomes transferable to human flourishing, not just profit extraction
    And he can mentor new EAE acquisitions through democratic transition
    And his skills serve life instead of serving only capital
