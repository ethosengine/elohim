Scenario: Advocacy for single-parent-friendly workplace policies
    Given Maria and single parent colleagues face systemic workplace barriers
    And employers may not understand scale of single parent challenges
    When Maria advocates for policy improvements
    Then the workplace_elohim should provide care economy data on single parents
    And advocacy should be strengthened by quantified evidence of work-care conflicts
    And Maria should be able to advocate collectively with other single parent workers
    And care economy data should support policy changes like flexible scheduling and adequate leave
    And workplace should adopt single-parent-friendly policies based on demonstrated needs
