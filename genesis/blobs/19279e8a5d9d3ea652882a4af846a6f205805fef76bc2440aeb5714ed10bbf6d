Scenario: Elder care for Margaret's mother made visible and valued
    Given Margaret provides 8 hours/week care coordination for her mother
    And Margaret's nursing background makes her care highly skilled
    When Margaret's elder care contributions are tracked
    Then the sophisticated care labor should be recognized
    And the time, skill, and emotional labor should be quantified
    And Margaret's siblings should see her care contributions
    And family resource allocation should reflect her caregiving
    And elder care should be valued as the skilled work it is
    And Margaret's contributions should give her voice in mother's care decisions
