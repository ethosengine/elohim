Scenario: Connecting personal consumption to planetary boundaries
    Given Kenji's consumption choices aggregate with billions of others
    And planetary boundaries define sustainable resource use
    When the bioregional_elohim shows planetary context
    Then it should help Kenji understand his consumption in global context
    And it should show "Your consumption is well below sustainable average"
    And it should connect personal choices to planetary care economy
    And it should teach him that individual actions scale to collective impact
    And the system should bridge personal and planetary scales
    And Kenji should understand himself as participant in planetary care economy
