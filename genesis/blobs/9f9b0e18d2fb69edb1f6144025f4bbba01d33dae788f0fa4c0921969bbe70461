Scenario: Building financial literacy through practice with support
    Given Aisha received minimal financial education
    And she's learning money management with real stakes
    When Aisha makes financial decisions in the scanner
    Then the personal_agent should provide contextual financial education
    And it should teach budgeting through actual practice
    And it should explain concepts like opportunity cost
    And it should help her understand efficiency frontiers
    And financial literacy should build through supported real-world decisions
    And mistakes should be learning opportunities, not catastrophes
