    And parentification is common and harmful in single-parent families

    Then it should detect if teen is taking on too much parental responsibility
    And it should alert Maria to concerning patterns
    And it should help her accept appropriate help while preventing harmful role-reversal
    And it should protect her teen's adolescence and development
    And the protocol should prevent damage from well-intentioned but unhealthy dynamics
