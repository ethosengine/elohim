Scenario: Organizer creates accessible materials on environmental permit process
    Given residents want to oppose toxic facility
    But permit process is technical and intimidating
    When the organizer requests education materials from Observer
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of permit requirements
    And get templates for submitting public comments
    And see examples of successful community opposition
    And access data residents can cite in testimony
    And complex regulatory process becomes accessible to community
