Scenario: Activist exposes politician voting record inconsistency
    Given a council member claims affordable housing support
    But the activist suspects performative politics
    When the Observer tracks five years of voting records
    Then the activist sees votes against transit funding 5 times
    And approvals of luxury development tax breaks
    And budget votes defunding affordable housing programs
    And patterns reveal rhetoric vs action divergence
    And accountability campaigns gain evidentiary backbone
