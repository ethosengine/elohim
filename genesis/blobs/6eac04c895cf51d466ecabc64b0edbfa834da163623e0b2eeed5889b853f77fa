Scenario: Modeling low-consumption lifestyle for next generation
    Given Margaret lives simply on retirement income
    And her low-consumption lifestyle has low environmental impact
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks consumption patterns
    Then it should recognize Margaret's low-impact lifestyle as ecological contribution
    And it should value simple living as environmental stewardship
    And it should show grandchildren that fulfillment doesn't require high consumption
    And low-impact living should be recognized as climate action
    And Margaret's lifestyle should model sustainable living
    And intergenerational value transmission should support sustainability
