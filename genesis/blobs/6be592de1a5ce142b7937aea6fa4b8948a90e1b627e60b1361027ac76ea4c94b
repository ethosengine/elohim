Scenario: Cognitive load management when mental labor is overwhelming
    Given Maria tracks countless details across three children's lives plus household plus work
    And she has no partner to share the mental load
    When Maria's cognitive load becomes unsustainable
    Then the personal_agent should actively hold complexity for her
    And it should remember what she can't
    And it should surface important details at the right time
    And it should reduce rather than increase mental labor
    And Maria should have external cognitive support that makes solo parenting more manageable
