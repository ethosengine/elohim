Scenario: Activist documents industrial pollution concentration pattern
    Given the activist works on environmental justice
    And suspects systematic pollution burden on communities of color
    When the Observer maps pollution sources and demographics
    Then the activist sees industrial permits cluster in Black and Latino neighborhoods
    And parks and trees concentrate in white affluent areas
    And asthma hospitalizations correlate with pollution exposure
    And environmental racism pattern becomes statistically undeniable
    And legal and regulatory action gains evidentiary foundation
