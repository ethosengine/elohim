Scenario: Meal prepping efficiently with limited energy
    Given I have only 2 hours between shifts to prepare meals
    And I am already exhausted from work
    When I need to prep food for the next several days
    Then the protocol should suggest maximum-efficiency meal prep strategies
    And provide step-by-step guidance requiring minimal cognitive load
    And optimize for nutritional value, cost, and preparation time
    And recognize this household labor as valuable care work
