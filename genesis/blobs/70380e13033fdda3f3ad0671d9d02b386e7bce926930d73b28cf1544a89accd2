Scenario: Mentoring younger adults in care economy navigation
    Given Robert has learned to navigate work-care balance over decades
    And younger adults are earlier in their journey
    And his experience could help others avoid struggles
    When community_elohim coordinates mentoring
    Then it should connect Robert with younger adults seeking guidance
    And recognize his mentoring as valuable care contribution
    And support him in sharing knowledge about care economy practices
    And help younger generation learn from his experience
    And value his mentoring in community care tokens
    And prevent him from being exploited for free emotional labor
    And build intergenerational knowledge transfer
