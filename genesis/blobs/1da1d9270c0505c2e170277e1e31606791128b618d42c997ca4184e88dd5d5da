Scenario: Neighborhood awareness of caregiver situation and needs
    Given many neighbors may not know about James's caregiving burden
    And invisibility prevents neighbors from offering support
    When the neighborhood_elohim shares appropriate information
    Then neighbors should be aware James is providing intensive care
    And they should understand his situation without violating privacy
    And awareness should enable neighbors to offer help meaningfully
    And James should not be invisible in his own neighborhood
    And caregiver situation should be visible enough to enable support
