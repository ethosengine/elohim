Scenario: Teen learns lifecycle of democratic participation
    Given Jasmine is years away from voting age
    And democratic participation extends beyond voting
    When she engages municipal governance through care economy
    Then she should learn that civic engagement is continuous practice
    And understand that democracy requires active participation, not just voting
    And develop relationships with municipal institutions
    And build civic skills through real participation in local governance
    And internalize that she has legitimate voice in shaping her city
    And grow into voting age already practiced in democratic engagement
