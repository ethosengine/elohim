Scenario: Community-level food justice advocacy informed by preteen experience
    Given Marcus's experience reveals food system failures
    And his data shows food access inequities
    When community food policy is developed
    Then Marcus's anonymized experience should inform advocacy
    And the community_elohim should aggregate data about food insecurity
    And community should advocate for systemic change
    And Marcus's struggles should fuel collective political action
    And care economy should connect individual experience to community organizing
    And his burden should contribute to changing systems that create it
