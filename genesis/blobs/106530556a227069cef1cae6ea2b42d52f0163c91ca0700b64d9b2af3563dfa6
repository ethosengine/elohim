Scenario: Advocating for workplace accessibility improvements
    Given Jordan notices that new book cart is hard to maneuver
    And workplace equipment should be accessible
    When Jordan reports the accessibility issue
    Then supervisors take Jordan's feedback seriously
    And the workplace_elohim facilitates accommodation discussion
    And the library adjusts equipment or provides alternative
    And Jordan's advocacy improves workplace for everyone
    And Jordan experiences being an active participant in workplace improvement
    And Jordan's voice shapes workplace accessibility
