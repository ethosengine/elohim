Scenario: Balancing family obligations with personal sustainability
    Given Aisha's family has ongoing needs
    And she has limited time and energy
    When family requests compete with Aisha's capacity
    Then the personal_agent should help her set boundaries
    And it should flag when family demands become unsustainable
    And it should help her communicate limits lovingly
    And the family_elohim should respect her capacity constraints
    And she should maintain family connection without burning out
    And sustainable care should be prioritized over martyrdom
