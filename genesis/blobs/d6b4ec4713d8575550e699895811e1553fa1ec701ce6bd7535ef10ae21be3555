Scenario: Teacher advocates for professional development that actually helps
    Given district mandates professional development hours
    But most PD is generic and doesn't improve teaching
    When teachers evaluate professional development through Observer
    Then teachers rate 75% of required PD as not useful for their teaching
    And identify what actually helps (job-embedded coaching, subject-specific content)
    And document time wasted on compliance PD vs productive professional learning
    And negotiate for teacher voice in PD planning and evaluation
    And professional development becomes professional not bureaucratic
