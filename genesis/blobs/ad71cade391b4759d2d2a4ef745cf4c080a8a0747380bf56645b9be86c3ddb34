Scenario: Academic learning applied to daily ecological choices
    Given Kenji studies environmental science academically
    And he makes consumption decisions daily
    When the bioregional_elohim connects learning to practice
    Then it should help him apply academic knowledge to personal choices
    And it should show "Your understanding of nitrogen cycles informs food decisions"
    And it should bridge theory and practice
    And it should recognize his daily life as laboratory for ecological care
    And the system should integrate academic and practical ecological knowledge
    And Kenji should live his environmental science education
