Scenario: Senior knowledge of neighborhood history and patterns
    Given Margaret has lived in the neighborhood for years/decades
    And she has institutional knowledge about local patterns
    When neighborhood decisions are being made
    Then Margaret's knowledge should inform decision-making
    And her historical perspective should be valued
    And she should have standing in neighborhood governance
    And long-term residents' wisdom should shape neighborhood future
    And Margaret's experience should be treated as valuable resource
    And neighborhood planning should benefit from senior knowledge
