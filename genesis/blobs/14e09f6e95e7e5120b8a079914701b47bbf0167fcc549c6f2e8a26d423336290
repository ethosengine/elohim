Scenario: Knowledge of seasonal patterns and bioregional ecology
    Given Margaret has observed local seasons, weather, and ecology for decades
    And she knows when plants bloom, birds migrate, harvest happens
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks ecological knowledge
    Then it should recognize Margaret's bioregional expertise
    And it should value her understanding of local seasonal patterns
    And it should document traditional ecological knowledge
    And seasonal wisdom should be shared with grandchildren and community
    And Margaret's observation should contribute to bioregional understanding
    And traditional knowledge should inform ecological care
