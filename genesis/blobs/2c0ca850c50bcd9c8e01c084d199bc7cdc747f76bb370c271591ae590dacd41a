Scenario: Teacher coalition challenges harmful curriculum mandate
    Given district mandates scripted curriculum contradicting best practices
    And individual teacher objections are dismissed as "resistance"
    When 180 teachers coordinate through Observer platform
    Then collective professional voice becomes undeniable
    And teachers present research on curriculum approach
    And document student engagement declining since mandate
    And propose evidence-based alternative approaches
    And collective expertise creates pressure for policy reconsideration
