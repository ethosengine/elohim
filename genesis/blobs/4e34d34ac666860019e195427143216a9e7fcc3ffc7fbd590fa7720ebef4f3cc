Scenario: Municipal planning includes elder wisdom and long-term perspective
    Given Frank has lived in the municipality for decades
    And he's observed long-term patterns and changes
    When the municipal_elohim facilitates planning processes
    Then it should actively seek Frank's long-term perspective
    And elder wisdom should inform infrastructure and policy decisions
    And decades of observation should guide municipal adaptation
    And Frank's experience should be valued in planning conversations
    And municipal governance should benefit from elder knowledge
    And intergenerational planning should integrate experienced voices
