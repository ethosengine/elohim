Scenario: Coordinating family care with partner in equitable partnership
    Given Sarah and partner share parenting responsibilities
    And they're raising children together
    When family care labor is distributed
    Then the family_elohim should track both partners' contributions
    And labor should be distributed equitably
    And neither partner should bear unfair burden
    And children should see modeled equitable partnership
    And family governance should be genuinely shared
