Scenario: Municipal data and transparency support informed civic participation
    Given Robert participates in municipal governance
    And effective participation requires access to information
    And municipal data is often hard to access or understand
    When municipal_elohim provides municipal data access
    Then it should surface relevant municipal data for Robert's interests
    And help him understand municipal budgets, demographics, and service utilization
    And provide analysis tools for municipal information
    And support informed civic participation through data transparency
    And demonstrate that democratic governance requires accessible information
    And build municipal transparency that enables resident engagement
    And empower residents to participate meaningfully in governance
