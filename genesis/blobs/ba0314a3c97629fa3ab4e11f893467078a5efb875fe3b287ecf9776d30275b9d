Scenario: Parent discovers teacher coalition opposing same policy
    Given the district proposes eliminating planning periods for teachers
    And the parent sees this will harm their child's education quality
    When the Observer shows teacher union concerns about the policy
    Then the parent understands teachers oppose it for same reasons
    And natural parent-teacher alliance becomes visible
    And parent and teacher testimonies reinforce each other
    And coordinated advocacy prevents divide-and-conquer tactics
    And district can't pit parents against teachers
