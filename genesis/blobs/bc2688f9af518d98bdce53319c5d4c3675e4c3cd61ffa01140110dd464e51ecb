Scenario: Manager derives legitimacy from consent rather than hierarchical appointment
    Given Marcus was previously appointed by corporate, not chosen by workers
    And workers resented his authority as imposed
    When democratic governance structures are established
    Then Marcus's coordinator role requires ongoing worker consent
    And workers evaluate his facilitation effectiveness quarterly
    And workers can democratically recall him if he fails to serve collective interests
    And his legitimacy is earned through effective service, not imposed through hierarchy
    And workplace_elohim ensures fair evaluation process
