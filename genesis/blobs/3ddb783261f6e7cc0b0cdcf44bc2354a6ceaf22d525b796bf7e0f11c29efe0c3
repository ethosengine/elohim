Scenario: Crop diversity increases through democratic decision-making
    Given Tom focused on high-value crops to maximize revenue under thin margins
    And crop diversity benefits soil health and risk distribution
    When democratic governance enables longer-term thinking

    And diversification reduces dependence on single crop market fluctuations
    And biodiversity increases through worker interest in varied cultivation
    And farm resilience improves through democratic long-term planning
