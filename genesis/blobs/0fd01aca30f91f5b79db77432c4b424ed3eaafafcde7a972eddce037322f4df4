Scenario: Community care economy education delivered by experienced practitioners
    Given Robert has decades of care economy participation
    And many community members don't understand care economy principles
    And his experience makes him credible educator
    When community_elohim identifies education opportunities
    Then it should connect Robert to community education initiatives
    And recognize him as qualified to teach care economy practices
    And support him in leading workshops, presentations, or courses
    And value his teaching as community care contribution
    And help community members learn from practitioners, not just theorists
    And build community care economy literacy through peer education
    And demonstrate that care economy spreads through experienced advocates
