Feature: Labor Justice Advocacy for Activist
  As an activist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer
  I want to fight for worker protections and living wages
  So that economic justice becomes civic policy priority

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active

  Scenario: Activist campaigns for municipal living wage ordinance
    Given workers in the city struggle with poverty wages
    And the activist advocates for living wage policy
    When the Observer documents local wage patterns
    Then the activist shows median wage is $14/hour in city with $22/hour living wage
    And sees public subsidies go to employers paying poverty wages
    And calculates economic impact of low wages on families and communities
    And mobilizes workers and community supporters for policy campaign
    And labor advocacy gains economic evidence foundation

  Scenario: Activist exposes wage theft and labor violations
    Given workers report widespread wage theft
    And enforcement seems inadequate
    When the Observer tracks labor violations and enforcement
    Then the activist documents thousands of violations annually
    And shows penalties are minimal and rarely collected
    And identifies which employers are repeat offenders
    And exposes regulatory capture of labor enforcement
    And worker protection becomes political accountability issue

  Scenario: Activist demands community benefits agreement for development
    Given a developer seeks public subsidies for project
    And claims it will "create jobs"
    When the Observer analyzes developer's labor track record
    Then the activist shows previous projects created mostly temp low-wage work
    And demonstrates few jobs went to local community members
    And reveals history of labor violations and union-busting
    And organizes coalition demanding binding labor standards
    And economic development serves workers not just capital

  Scenario: Activist fights for paid sick leave policy
    Given workers lack basic workplace protections
    And the activist campaigns for paid sick leave ordinance
    When the Observer shows public health and economic impacts
    Then the activist demonstrates workers go to work sick
    And spread illness because they can't afford to stay home
    And public health costs of no sick leave
    And presents evidence from cities with successful sick leave policies
    And worker protection becomes public health imperative

  Scenario: Activist connects workplace justice to municipal budget
    Given city approved $5M tax break for developer
    But refused to fund $500K worker center
    When the Observer makes budget trade-offs visible
    Then the activist exposes value priorities (corporate welfare vs worker support)
    And shows developer already profitable without subsidy
    And demonstrates worker center's community economic impact
    And organizes campaign to redirect public resources
    And municipal priorities become labor justice battleground
