Scenario: Deliberating on adolescent autonomy constitutional amendment
    Given many national councils identified adolescent autonomy tension
    And amendment proposal came from accumulated appeal precedents
    When we deliberate whether "developing autonomy is itself constitutional value"
    Then we hear: testimony from youth, parents, developmental experts
    And we examine: how different cultures understand adolescent autonomy
    And we consider: implications for millions of families globally
    And we discuss: in small groups with translation support
    And we grapple: with balancing protection and independence
    And we vote: on amendment after extensive deliberation
    And we create: constitutional evolution responsive to lived experience
    And we demonstrate: citizens can govern profound questions
