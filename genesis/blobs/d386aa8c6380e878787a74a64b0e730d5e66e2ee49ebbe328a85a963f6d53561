Scenario: Peer learning networks facilitated through care economy
    Given young adults learn effectively from peers
    And Aisha's peers face similar challenges
    When Aisha connects with peers through the system
    Then the personal_agent should facilitate peer learning
    And it should enable knowledge exchange among young adults
    And it should coordinate peer teaching and support
    And collective learning should be more effective than isolated struggle
    And peer networks should be educational resources
    And mutual learning should strengthen community
