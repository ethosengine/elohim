Scenario: Coordinate resource allocation across diverse neighborhoods
    Given downtown needs economic development support
    And residential areas prioritize environmental protection
    And outskirts need infrastructure investment
    When Municipal Elohim analyzes resource allocation
    Then agent shows resource flows and gaps across neighborhoods
    And agent identifies conflicts and synergies
    And Jamal facilitates city council deliberation with agent data
    And city council makes democratic allocation decisions
    And protocol enables informed democratic choice
