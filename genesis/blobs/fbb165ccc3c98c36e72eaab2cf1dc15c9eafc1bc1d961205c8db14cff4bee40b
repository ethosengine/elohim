Scenario: Regional food security through care economy participation
    Given Maria participates in food cooperatives and bulk buying networks
    And these networks build local food security and resilience
    When bioregional food systems are assessed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her contribution to food security
    And it should value community food cooperation as regional resilience
    And her participation should be seen as strengthening local food systems
    And food economy cooperation should be honored as bioregional stewardship
    And Maria should see herself as contributing to regional food sovereignty
