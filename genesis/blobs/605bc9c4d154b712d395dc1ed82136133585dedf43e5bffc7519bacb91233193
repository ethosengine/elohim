Feature: Municipal Civic Advocacy for Activist
  As an activist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want to track multiple civic bodies and hold power accountable
  So that policy serves community wellbeing not special interests

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the municipality governance context is active

  Scenario: Activist monitors multiple municipal bodies simultaneously
    Given the activist's issue spans city council, planning commission, and housing authority
    And attending all meetings is physically impossible
    When the Observer monitors all civic bodies
    Then the activist receives alerts for relevant agenda items
    And sees summaries of decisions across all bodies
    And identifies coordination opportunities across agencies
    And sustainable multi-body surveillance becomes possible
    And activist capacity multiplies through automation

  Scenario: Activist exposes politician voting record inconsistency
    Given a council member claims affordable housing support
    But the activist suspects performative politics
    When the Observer tracks five years of voting records
    Then the activist sees votes against transit funding 5 times
    And approvals of luxury development tax breaks
    And budget votes defunding affordable housing programs
    And patterns reveal rhetoric vs action divergence
    And accountability campaigns gain evidentiary backbone

  Scenario: Activist identifies developer's cross-jurisdiction pattern
    Given a developer is proposing controversial project
    And uses familiar tactics from other campaigns
    When the Observer tracks developer across municipalities
    Then the activist sees the same firm using identical playbook in 8 cities
    And views track record of community promises vs delivery
    And identifies political relationships and campaign donations
    And systematic exploitation becomes undeniable
    And activists coordinate across jurisdictions

  Scenario: Activist builds budget justice coalition across issues
    Given multiple communities face budget cuts affecting different services
    And the activist works on housing but sees connections
    When the Observer reveals municipal budget priorities
    Then the activist sees cuts to housing, transit, libraries, and social services
    And identifies shared interest across issue silos
    And facilitates coalition of housing, transit, and education advocates
    And budget fight becomes coordinated multi-issue campaign
    And fragmented advocacy becomes unified power

  Scenario: Activist documents municipal service delivery inequities
    Given the activist advocates for environmental justice
    And suspects systematic discrimination in service delivery
    When the Observer analyzes municipal operations patterns
    Then the activist sees infrastructure investment concentrated in white neighborhoods
    And pollution permits cluster in communities of color
    And code enforcement disparities by neighborhood
    And systematic racism becomes statistically undeniable
    And legal and political action gains foundation
