Scenario: Defending legislation against corporate capture testimony
    Given corporate lobbyists testify against my legislation
    And they claim it "stifles innovation"
    When I respond in committee hearing
    Then I present: evidence from Riverside and research
    And I show: protocol improves community outcomes
    And I demonstrate: constitutional oversight working
    And I compare: to corporate AI failures (surveillance, discrimination, no recourse)
    And I argue: we're stifling extraction, enabling flourishing
    And I maintain: that democracy deserves support
    And committee votes: 8-5 in favor despite lobbying
