Scenario: Community mutual aid framework includes youth contributors
    Given Marcus provides substantial care labor
    And mutual aid operates on everyone having something to give
    When community mutual aid networks operate
    Then Marcus should be recognized as legitimate contributor
    And his household labor should count as mutual aid contribution
    And youth should be included in reciprocal care networks
    And age should not exclude him from mutual aid participation
    And community should value care work regardless of who performs it
    And Marcus should experience being valued community member
