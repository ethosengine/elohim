Scenario: Teacher exposes resource distribution inequities
    Given some schools have abundant materials while others lack basics
    And district claims equitable allocation
    When teachers document resources across schools through Observer
    Then data reveals wealthy-area schools get $800/student discretionary
    And high-poverty schools get $200/student discretionary
    And teachers coordinate with parents in under-resourced schools
    And bring evidence of systematic inequity to board
    And resource distribution becomes equity accountability issue
