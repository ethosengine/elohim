Scenario: Food security support accessed with dignity through care economy
    Given Maria's $175/week grocery budget for four people is severely constrained
    And food security is essential for family well-being
    When Maria's economic status qualifies her for food support
    Then the community_elohim should connect her to food assistance programs
    And support should be framed as care economy reciprocity, not charity
    And Maria should access help without stigmatizing means-testing processes
    And her massive care contributions should be recognized as qualifying her for support
    And food assistance should be dignified and adequate for family needs
