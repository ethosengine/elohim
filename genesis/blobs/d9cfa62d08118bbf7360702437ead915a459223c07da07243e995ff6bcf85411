Scenario: Provide evidence to Senator Ruiz for federal policy continuation
    Given Elena needs evidence that federal funding produces lasting benefits
    When James presents 10-year findings to Senate Committee
    Then he shows sustained wellbeing improvements across decade
    And he demonstrates democratic capacity building persists
    And he documents cost-effectiveness over long-term horizon
    And he provides honest assessment of challenges and failures
    And his rigorous longitudinal research justifies continued federal investment
