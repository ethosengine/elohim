Scenario: Politician monitors municipal employment practices as major employer
    Given the politician has authority over city or state employment
    And serves as model employer in jurisdiction
    When the Observer analyzes public sector employment patterns
    Then they see whether public wages meet living wage standards
    And identify disparities in public sector compensation by role
    And understand whether public employment offers quality jobs
    And learn contractor and subcontractor wage and labor practices
    And ensure public sector models worker-centered employment practices
