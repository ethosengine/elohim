Scenario: Family care economy coordinates reciprocity across generations
    Given Sarah receives childcare support from grandparents
    And Sarah provides elder care to her aging parents
    When the family_elohim analyzes care flows
    Then it should show reciprocal care patterns
    And it should ensure care is not unidirectionally extractive
    And it should coordinate so care flows equitably
    And family relationships should be based on mutual support
    And the system should enable sustainable multigenerational care
    And care economy should prevent family exploitation
