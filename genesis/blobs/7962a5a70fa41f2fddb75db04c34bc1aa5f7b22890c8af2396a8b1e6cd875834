Scenario: Farm protects green space and agricultural land from development pressure
    Given farmland faces constant development pressure for housing or commercial use
    And community loses agricultural land, green space, and food production capacity
    When democratic ownership with community investment protects farmland
    Then community investment ensures land remains in agricultural use
    And development pressure is resisted through collective commitment
    And green space is preserved for ecological, aesthetic, and food security benefits
    And community gains protected agricultural land as permanent institution
    And community_elohim coordinates land protection and community land trust options
