Scenario: Activist challenges school closure targeting Black neighborhoods
    Given the district proposes closing schools for "efficiency"
    And the activist suspects racial targeting
    When the Observer analyzes closure patterns across time
    Then the activist sees schools in Black neighborhoods systematically closed
    And white neighborhood schools remain open despite similar enrollment
    And "efficiency" rationale masks structural racism
    And community organizes opposition with documented evidence
    And racist policy becomes undeniable and challengeable
