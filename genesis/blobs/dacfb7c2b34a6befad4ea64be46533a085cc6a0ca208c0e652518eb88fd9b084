Scenario: Learning value beyond price through multi-dimensional comparison
    Given Emma is evaluating fair-trade chocolate
    And she has capacity for understanding multiple value dimensions
    When Emma scans the chocolate product
    Then her personal_agent should show nutritional value
    And the agent should show environmental impact
    And the agent should explain care labor: "The farmers who grew this were paid fairly for their care work"
    And the agent should show community benefit
    And price should be one factor among many
    And Emma should learn to read the world's complexity, not just price tags
    And value literacy should extend beyond simple cost comparison
