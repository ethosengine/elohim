Scenario: Mayor builds coalition for affordable housing initiative
    Given the politician champions affordable housing policy
    And needs support from diverse stakeholders
    When the Observer surfaces coalition potential
    Then they see tenant organizations share policy interest
    And identify labor unions, faith communities, and senior advocates as allies
    And facilitate bringing stakeholders to table for policy design
    And track negotiation positions and evolution
    And build multi-stakeholder coalition for policy passage
