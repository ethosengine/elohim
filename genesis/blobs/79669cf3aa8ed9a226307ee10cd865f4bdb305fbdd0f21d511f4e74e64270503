Scenario: Workers coordinate sector-wide minimum standards
    Given different EAE food entities have varying wage and benefit levels
    And workers want to prevent race-to-bottom competition
    When food service sector workers hold coordination meeting
    Then workers from multiple entities propose sector minimum wage ($18/hour)
    And workers deliberate on benefits standards (paid sick leave, health insurance)
    And sector workers vote to adopt coordinated minimums
    And industry_sector_elohim helps enforce standards across network
    And local entities can exceed minimums but not undercut them
