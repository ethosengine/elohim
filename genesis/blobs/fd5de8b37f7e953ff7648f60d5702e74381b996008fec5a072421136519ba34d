Scenario: Bulk purchasing coordination with neighbors for cost savings
    Given Maria operates on severe budget constraints
    And bulk purchasing saves money but requires coordination
    When neighbors organize bulk buying cooperatives
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate collective purchasing
    And it should help Maria access wholesale prices through group orders
    And it should facilitate cost-sharing and distribution logistics
    And bulk buying should reduce Maria's grocery costs meaningfully
    And neighborhood economic cooperation should help single-parent resource constraints
