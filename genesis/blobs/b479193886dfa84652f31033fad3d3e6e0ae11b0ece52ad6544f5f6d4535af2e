Given protocol creates novel economic relationships
And tax implications are unclear
When I work with revenue department on clarification
Then we determine: tax treatment of care tokens
And we address: property tax implications of resource sharing
And we clarify: whether mutual aid counts for social safety net
And we create: certainty enabling protocol to function
And we avoid: creating impossible tax burdens
And we ensure: tax policy doesn't undermine protocol benefits
And legal clarity: supports implementation
