Scenario: Emergency meal provision when Maria is sick or overwhelmed
    Given Maria has no co-parent to cook when she's sick or at breaking point
    And she still must feed three children regardless of her state
    When Maria faces health crisis or exhaustion emergency
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should activate meal provision network
    And neighbors should be able to provide emergency meal support
    And Maria should receive help based on her care economy standing, not charity
    And emergency support should be dignified and reciprocal
    And neighborhood should serve as backup for solo parent crisis
