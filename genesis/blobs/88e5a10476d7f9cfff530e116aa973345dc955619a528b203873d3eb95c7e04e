Scenario: Navigating school bureaucracy and institutional requirements
    Given schools require forms, meetings, documentation, and coordination
    And school bureaucracy can be overwhelming during crisis
    When I manage school institutional requirements
    Then the Value Scanner tracks all school deadlines and requirements
    And helps me gather necessary documentation efficiently
    And prepares me for required school meetings (IEP, parent-teacher conferences)
    And ensures nothing falls through cracks despite my overwhelm
    And my personal_agent reminds me of upcoming school obligations
    And recognizes school bureaucracy navigation as cognitive labor
    And validates that school demands are significant amid crisis
    And prevents school requirements from overwhelming me
