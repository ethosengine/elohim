Scenario: Making invisible household care labor visible to roommates
    Given Kenji cooks meals for all four roommates regularly
    And he plans menus, shops for ingredients, and manages kitchen
    When the household_elohim tracks Kenji's household contributions
    Then it should quantify his cooking labor in care tokens
    And it should make visible that he provides nutrition care for four people
    And his roommates should see "Kenji cooked 18 meals this week for household"
    And invisible care work should become undeniably visible
    And the system should prevent resentment from invisible labor
    And fair household coordination requires visibility
