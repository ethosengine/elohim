Scenario: Investor capital enables regenerative agriculture transition at bioregional scale
    Given industrial agriculture degrades ecosystems and requires fossil fuel dependence
    And Patricia wants investment supporting ecological regeneration
    When community investment supports democratic farm conversions bioregionally
    Then capital enables farms transitioning to regenerative practices (Johnson Farm and others)
    And bioregional agricultural system shifts toward soil building and carbon sequestration
    And investment supports ecosystem regeneration while providing fair returns
    And food system transformation includes ecological healing
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates regenerative agriculture investment across bioregion
