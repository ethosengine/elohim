Scenario: Global research ethics and decolonizing methodology
    Given historical research often extracted from Global South for Global North benefit
    And I want to practice ethical global research
    When I design my research methodology and partnerships
    Then I ensure: local researchers lead studies in their contexts
    And I practice: equitable benefit sharing and co-authorship
    And I support: capacity building in Global South institutions
    And I challenge: Western-centric theories and methods
    And I listen: to diverse epistemologies and knowledge systems
    And I acknowledge: positionality and power in research relationships
    And My practice embodies: research ethics aligned with protocol's dignity principles
