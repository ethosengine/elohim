Scenario: Senior knowledge of waste reduction valued as ecological wisdom
    Given Margaret's generation learned to minimize waste
    And reducing waste is both budget necessity and ecological imperative
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks waste reduction practices
    Then Margaret's waste minimization should be recognized
    And her knowledge of using everything should be valued
    And practices like saving containers, composting scraps should be tracked
    And generational wisdom should inform community sustainability
    And frugality should be reframed as ecological stewardship
    And Margaret's practices should be teaching resource for younger generations
