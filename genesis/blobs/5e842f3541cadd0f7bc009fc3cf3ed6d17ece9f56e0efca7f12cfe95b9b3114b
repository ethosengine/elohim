Scenario: Studying global inequality in protocol access and benefits
    Given I hypothesize protocol might exacerbate global inequality
    And wealthy nations can afford infrastructure poor nations cannot
    When I analyze distributional effects at global scale
    Then I examine: adoption rates by national income and infrastructure
    And I assess: whether benefits flow primarily to Global North
    And I measure: whether protocol reduces or increases global inequality
    And I explore: mechanisms of digital colonialism or democratic leveling
    And I identify: barriers preventing equitable global adoption
    And I advocate: for international funding and technology transfer
    And My research serves: global justice by revealing inequities
