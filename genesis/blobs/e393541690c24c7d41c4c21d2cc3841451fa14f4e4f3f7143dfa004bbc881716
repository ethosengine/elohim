Scenario: Regional research consortium collaboration
    Given I am part of network studying protocol across multiple regions
    And we coordinate methods to enable comparison
    When we conduct parallel studies with shared protocols
    Then we can: pool data to increase statistical power
    And we enable: replication across different contexts
    And we identify: universal patterns vs context-specific findings
    And we learn: from each other's methodological innovations
    And we create: cumulative knowledge building across research community
    And My regional work contributes to: global understanding of democratic AI governance
