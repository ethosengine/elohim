Scenario: Cognitive support enables continued learning despite limitations
    Given Helen's dementia affects learning and memory
    And cognitive support can enable continued engagement
    When Helen participates in educational activities
    Then her personal_agent should provide cognitive scaffolding
    And material should be adapted to her cognitive capabilities
    And she should experience success, not frustration
    And limitations should be accommodated, not treated as disqualification
    And the protocol should enable learning despite cognitive changes
    And Helen should remain engaged with intellectual life
    And dementia should not end her identity as learner
