    Given Maria purchases secondhand when possible to reduce costs

    And it should value sharing networks as resource efficiency
    And her practices should be celebrated as circular economy leadership
    And economic constraint should be honored as environmental wisdom
    And Maria should be recognized as sustainability practitioner
