    Given Sarah has educational values and goals for her children
    And Margaret's teaching should align with parental approach
    When the educational_elohim coordinates between generations
    Then it should help Margaret understand Sarah's educational priorities
    And it should facilitate alignment between grandparent and parent teaching
    And it should preserve Margaret's educational autonomy within boundaries
    And educational coordination should be collaborative, not hierarchical
    And family_elohim should help navigate educational partnership
    And children should receive consistent, complementary education
