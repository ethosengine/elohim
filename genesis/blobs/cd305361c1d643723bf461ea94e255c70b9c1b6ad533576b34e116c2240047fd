Scenario: Organizer creates accessible education materials for community meeting
    Given the organizer is holding meeting about proposed zoning changes
    And community members have limited policy literacy and speak multiple languages
    When the organizer requests education materials from Observer
    Then they receive one-page summary in plain language
    And get versions in Spanish, Mandarin, and Vietnamese
    And see visual infographics showing community impact
    And access deeper detail for residents who want more information
    And 47-page staff report becomes accessible to whole community
