Scenario: Personal values preservation despite intense care demands
    Given Sarah has core values beyond efficient caregiving
    And she wants to raise children aligned with those values
    When Sarah makes care decisions under pressure
    Then the personal_agent should help her honor her values
    And it should flag when expedience conflicts with principles
    And it should support value-aligned decision making even when harder
    And Sarah's integrity should be preserved despite overwhelming demands
    And the system should help her be the parent she wants to be
    And values should not be sacrificed to mere survival
