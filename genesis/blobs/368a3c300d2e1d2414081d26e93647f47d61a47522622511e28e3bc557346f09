Scenario: Crisis response for disability community during emergencies
    Given emergencies disproportionately harm disabled people
    And Alex coordinates disability community emergency response
    When community faces crisis (pandemic, disaster, etc.)
    Then Alex's crisis organizing should be recognized as essential care work
    And the community_elohim should support disability-led emergency response
    And Alex's work protecting vulnerable community members should be highly valued
    And care tokens should reflect the lifesaving nature of crisis work
    And the protocol should enable rapid mutual aid coordination
    And disability community expertise should guide emergency systems
    And Alex's leadership should be supported with resources
