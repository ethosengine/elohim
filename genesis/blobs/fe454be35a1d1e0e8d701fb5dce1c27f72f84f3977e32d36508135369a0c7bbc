Scenario: State legislator verifies industry claims about regulation impacts
    Given business lobbyists claim environmental regulation will destroy jobs
    And present alarming economic analysis
    When the Observer fact-checks industry projections
    Then they see similar regulations in other states
    And review actual employment impacts versus predicted job losses
    And identify which industries comply without job losses
    And understand costs of inaction (health impacts, environmental damage)
    And resist fear-mongering with evidence-based policy analysis
