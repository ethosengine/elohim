Scenario: Appeal escalation path when community review insufficient
    Given Community Elohim review upheld the original decision
    And I remain convinced my constitutional rights were violated
    When I choose to escalate beyond community layer
    Then I can request peer agent review (three Family Elohim from other families)
    And If still unsatisfied, I can escalate to Regional Constitutional Council
    And Each layer brings fresh perspective and greater scrutiny
    And The escalation path is accessible without legal expertise
    And Timelines are maintained (peer review within 1 week, regional within 1 month)
    And Higher layers don't just rubber-stamp lower decisions
    And Genuine independent review happens at each escalation level
