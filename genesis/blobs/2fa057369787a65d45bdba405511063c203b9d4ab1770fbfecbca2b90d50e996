Scenario: Municipal emergency response includes teen care contributions
    Given the municipality experiences emergency situation (natural disaster, pandemic)
    And community resilience depends on care economy networks
    When emergency response is coordinated through municipal_elohim
    Then teen care contributions should be recognized and mobilized
    And Jasmine's capability should be matched to community needs
    And youth mutual aid networks should be integrated into response
    And teen volunteers should be valued as essential emergency workers
    And care economy should demonstrate that communities survive crises through mutual care
    And her generation should learn that civic responsibility includes crisis response
