Scenario: Citizen evaluates development proposal affecting neighborhood
    Given a developer proposes new construction in their neighborhood
    And claims it will "bring community benefits"
    When the citizen reviews the Observer analysis
    Then they see actual value flows (who benefits, who pays)
    And view the developer's track record from past projects
    And understand infrastructure impacts (traffic, services, green space)
    And can challenge claims with evidence not just emotion
    And make informed decisions about supporting or opposing
