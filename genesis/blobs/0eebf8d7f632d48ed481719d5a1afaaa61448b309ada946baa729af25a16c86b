Scenario: Construction waste reduction and material reuse
    Given construction generates substantial waste
    And Frank has knowledge of material reuse and salvage
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks construction waste
    Then it should help Frank minimize waste in Habitat projects
    And facilitate salvaging and reusing materials
    And recognize waste reduction as ecological care contribution
    And teach construction waste minimization to others
    And quantify environmental benefit of material reuse
    And Frank's expertise should reduce construction environmental impact
