# REA Accounting: Tracking Value Without Markets

## Beyond Double-Entry Bookkeeping

Traditional accounting was designed for businesses: track assets, liabilities, and equity. Double-entry bookkeeping, invented in 15th-century Italy, revolutionized commerce.

But it can't see:
- Value that doesn't have a price
- Flows that don't involve ownership transfer
- Contributions that benefit communities, not individuals

## What is REA?

REA stands for **Resources, Events, and Agents**. It's an accounting ontology developed for enterprise systems, now extended for the care economy.

### Resources
Things of value—not just money, but:
- Skills, knowledge, expertise
- Attention, presence, care
- Physical goods and spaces
- Ecological assets
- Reputation and trust

### Events
Things that happen to resources:
- Creation, consumption, transformation
- Transfer, commitment, sharing
- Degradation, restoration

### Agents
Who or what participates:
- Individuals, families, communities
- Organizations, networks, ecosystems
- AI systems (including Elohim)

## How It Works

### Traditional Accounting
```
Transaction: Alice pays Bob $50 for babysitting
Record: 
  - Alice: -$50 cash
  - Bob: +$50 cash
```
This misses: the care provided, the trust built, the child's development, the relationship strengthened.

### REA Accounting
```
Event: Bob provides 4 hours of childcare to Alice's family
Records:
  - Bob: -4 hours attention/care (resource flow)
  - Alice's family: +4 hours childcare received
  - Alice's child: developmental benefit (resource increment)
  - Bob-Alice relationship: trust increment
  - Bob: +$50 (if paid) OR +recognition (if unpaid)
  - Community: +social capital (spillover)
```

## Why This Matters

### For Policy Makers
REA makes the care economy visible to policy analysis:
- What would happen if we invested in childcare infrastructure?
- How do caregiver support programs affect health outcomes?
- Where are the gaps in community resilience?

### For Developers
REA provides a data model for care-aware platforms:
- Recognition systems that track non-monetary contribution
- Reciprocity networks that enable mutual aid
- Analytics that measure wellbeing, not just engagement

### For Everyone
REA helps you see your own invisible contributions:
- That mentoring you do? It has value.
- The community you build? It's real economic activity.
- The care you provide? It deserves recognition.

## The ValueFlows Vocabulary

The Elohim Protocol uses [ValueFlows](https://valueflo.ws/), an open vocabulary for economic networks based on REA:

### Core Concepts
- **EconomicResource**: Anything of value (skills, goods, care, attention)
- **EconomicEvent**: Something that happened (transfer, use, production)
- **Process**: A transformation (teaching session, caregiving episode)
- **Agent**: A participant (person, organization, AI)
- **Intent**: A planned action (offer, request, commitment)

### Why Open Standards Matter
- **Interoperability**: Different systems can share value data
- **Portability**: Your contribution history travels with you
- **Transparency**: No proprietary black boxes
- **Collaboration**: Community-developed, not corporate-controlled

## Practical Applications

### Mutual Aid Networks
Track who helped whom, enable reciprocity without money:
- Time banking that works across communities
- Skill sharing with visible contribution histories
- Care coordination that respects relationship

### Community Currencies
REA-based tokens that represent real value:
- Local currencies backed by community capacity
- Care credits that recognize invisible work
- Reputation systems with verifiable history

### Impact Measurement
Move beyond vanity metrics:
- Track wellbeing outcomes, not just activities
- Measure relationship quality, not just engagement
- Value ecological regeneration, not just extraction

## The Connection to Holochain

The Elohim Protocol implements REA accounting on Holochain—a distributed system where:
- Each community controls its own value data
- No central authority defines what counts
- Privacy and transparency are balanced by design
