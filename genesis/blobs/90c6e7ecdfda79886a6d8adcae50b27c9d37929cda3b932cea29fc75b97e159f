Scenario: Exercising financial autonomy despite constrained resources
    Given I am managing an extremely limited budget
    And I have temporary assistance and unreliable child support
    When I make spending decisions for my household
    Then the Value Scanner supports MY financial choices
    And does not impose external judgments about "proper" spending
    And helps me track and optimize within my constraints
    And recognizes that I understand my children's needs
    And provides decision support without taking over decisions
    And validates that my resource management under crisis is sophisticated work
    And my personal_agent suggests options without prescribing choices
    And my financial sovereignty is respected
