Scenario: Journalist develops whistleblower source on contract fraud
    Given a city employee witnesses fraudulent contracting
    And fears retaliation for speaking to press
    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel
    Then the whistleblower shares documents through protected system
    And journalist receives evidence of no-bid contracts to connected firms
    And investigates without exposing source identity
    And publishes investigation based on documents and additional reporting
    And source protection enables accountability journalism
