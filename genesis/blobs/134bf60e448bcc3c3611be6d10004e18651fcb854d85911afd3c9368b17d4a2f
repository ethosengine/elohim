Scenario: Personal agent serves as cognitive partner for overwhelming complexity
    Given Sarah is managing multiple care contexts simultaneously
    And Sarah is planning Tuesday evening meals
    And she must coordinate children's developmental needs, budget, allergies, schedule, and community obligations
    When Sarah opens the Value Scanner
    Then her personal_agent should present integrated complexity overview
    And the agent should surface conflicts before they become crises
    And it should suggest solutions balancing competing needs
    And it should track factors Sarah can't hold simultaneously
    And Sarah should experience genuine cognitive partnership
    And the agent should reduce mental load, not add to it
