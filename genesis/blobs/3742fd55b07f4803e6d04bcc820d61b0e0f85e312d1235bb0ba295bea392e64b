Scenario: Coordinating between Margaret's household and Sarah's household
    Given Margaret has her own household with Robert
    And Sarah has her household with her own governance
    When the family_elohim coordinates across households
    Then it should respect both household autonomies
    And it should help negotiate care arrangements between households
    And it should coordinate schedules, logistics, and expectations
    And boundaries between households should be clear and respected
    And neither household should dominate the other
    And care coordination should serve both households' needs
    And multigenerational care should work across household boundaries
