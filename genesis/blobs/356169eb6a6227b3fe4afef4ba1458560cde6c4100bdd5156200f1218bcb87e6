Scenario: Retired residents as civic engagement resource for municipal governance
    Given Frank has time freedom enabling substantial civic participation
    And many retired residents can attend daytime meetings and hearings
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates civic engagement
    Then it should recognize retired residents as civic participation resource
    And facilitate their attendance at municipal meetings and hearings
    And coordinate testimony and advocacy utilizing their availability
    And recognize civic engagement as care contribution
    And retired residents should be understood as democracy infrastructure
    And Frank should participate meaningfully in municipal governance
    And elder voice should shape municipal policy
