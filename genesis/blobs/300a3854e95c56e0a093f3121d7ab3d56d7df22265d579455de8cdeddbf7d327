Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult
  As a young adult maintaining family relationships while establishing independence
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to contribute to family care economy across distance
  So that I maintain family bonds through reciprocal care

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the young_adult user "Aisha" is registered in the system
    And Aisha is 23 years old living independently
    And Aisha's family includes parents and younger siblings
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim coordinates across geographic distance
    And Aisha participates as an independent adult family member

  Scenario: Remote care contributions to family of origin
    Given Aisha lives in a different city from her family
    And she wants to stay connected through care
    When Aisha helps her younger siblings with homework remotely
    Then the family_elohim should track her care contributions
    And care tokens should accumulate for her help
    And her parents should see her contributions
    And siblings should be able to request her help
    And the system should maintain family care bonds across distance
    And geographic separation shouldn't prevent care economy participation

  Scenario: Transition from dependent child to independent adult in family
    Given Aisha was recently a dependent family member
    And she's now an independent adult
    When Aisha participates in family governance
    Then her voice should carry equal weight to other adults
    And she should participate in family decisions as a peer
    And her care contributions should be recognized as adult care work
    And the family_elohim should reflect her changed status
    And family relationships should adapt to her independence
    And she should be valued as capable adult contributor

  Scenario: Contributing to family care economy while managing own resources
    Given Aisha has limited financial resources
    And she wants to support her family
    When Aisha decides what care to contribute
    Then the system should help her balance competing obligations
    And it should recognize that her care capacity is limited
    And it should validate both family support and self-care
    And the family_elohim should not create unsustainable demands
    And Aisha should maintain boundaries while remaining connected

  Scenario: Care contributions during family visits
    Given Aisha visits her family home periodically
    And she provides substantial care labor during visits
    When Aisha cooks, shops, and helps with household tasks
    Then the family_elohim should track her visit contributions
    And cooking, shopping, and household help should all be valued
    And her care work should be visible to the family
    And recognition should validate her adult contributions
    And family visits should be understood as care labor, not just leisure
    And care tokens should reflect the value she provides

  Scenario: Participating in family decisions from distance
    Given Aisha is geographically distant from family
    And important family decisions need her input
    When the family makes significant decisions
    Then the family_elohim should facilitate remote participation
    And Aisha's input should be solicited appropriately
    And her adult perspective should be valued
    And technology should enable genuine participation
    And distance shouldn't exclude her from family governance
    And her independent status should give her legitimate voice

  Scenario: Learning adult family care from parents' modeling
    Given Aisha's parents demonstrate care economy practices
    And she's learning adult family participation
    When Aisha observes family care patterns
    Then the family_elohim should make parental care work visible
    And Aisha should learn what adult family care looks like
    And intergenerational knowledge transfer should occur
    And she should understand family care as lifelong practice
    And the system should facilitate learning from family elders

  Scenario: Supporting younger siblings while building own life
    Given Aisha has younger teenage siblings
    And she wants to support their development
    When Aisha provides mentoring and help
    Then the family_elohim should recognize sibling care
    And her contributions should be valued appropriately
    And siblings should learn from her young adult experience
    And the system should coordinate cross-generational sibling support
    And family bonds should be strengthened through visible care
    And Aisha should model care economy participation for siblings

  Scenario: Balancing family obligations with personal sustainability
    Given Aisha's family has ongoing needs
    And she has limited time and energy
    When family requests compete with Aisha's capacity
    Then the personal_agent should help her set boundaries
    And it should flag when family demands become unsustainable
    And it should help her communicate limits lovingly
    And the family_elohim should respect her capacity constraints
    And she should maintain family connection without burning out
    And sustainable care should be prioritized over martyrdom

  Scenario: Family privacy controls for independent adult
    Given Aisha has adult autonomy
    And she maintains some privacy from family
    When Aisha configures family data sharing
    Then she should control what family sees
    And she should choose what care contributions to share
    And her financial details should remain private unless she shares
    And personal life decisions should be hers to disclose
    And the system should support healthy adult family boundaries
    And privacy should coexist with care economy participation

  Scenario: Care tokens flow between independent adult and family
    Given Aisha both contributes to and receives from family
    And care flows in multiple directions
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Aisha's contributions should generate tokens
    And she should be able to use tokens for family support when needed
    And parents' ongoing care should be recognized
    And reciprocal care should be tracked transparently
    And the family care economy should adapt to her independence
    And adult family relationships should involve mutual care

  Scenario: Family financial support coordinated through care economy
    Given Aisha's family sometimes needs financial help
    And Aisha wants to contribute within her means
    When Aisha provides financial support to family
    Then the contribution should be recognized as care work
    And it should be coordinated through family_elohim
    And the system should help her determine sustainable amounts
    And family financial support should be visible care contribution
    And her limited resources should be acknowledged
    And financial care should strengthen rather than strain relationships

  Scenario: Maintaining family cultural practices across distance
    Given Aisha's family has specific cultural traditions
    And she wants to maintain cultural connection
    When Aisha participates in family cultural practices
    Then the family_elohim should support cultural continuity
    And it should help coordinate cultural events across distance
    And it should recognize cultural care work she performs
    And family cultural values should shape her care economy participation
    And distance shouldn't prevent cultural transmission
    And her cultural identity should be maintained through family care bonds
