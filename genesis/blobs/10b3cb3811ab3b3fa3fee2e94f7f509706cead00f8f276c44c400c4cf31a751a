Scenario: Building individual resilience through care work visibility
    Given the protocol tracks all my care contributions
    Including my paid labor and household self-care
    When I review my care economy participation
    Then I should see comprehensive evidence of my contributions
    And understand that I am providing valuable service to community
    And recognize that I deserve better compensation and conditions
    And feel empowered to advocate for my needs
