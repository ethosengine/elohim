Scenario: Elder care responsibilities coordinated between partners
    Given Robert's parents ages 78 and 75 require increasing care
    And Jennifer's father age 80 also needs support
    And coordinating three aging parents is complex
    When household_elohim coordinates elder care
    Then it should track care needs across three parents
    And help Robert and Jennifer distribute elder care responsibilities
    And surface conflicts: "Both mothers have medical appointments Tuesday 2pm"
    And coordinate with Robert's siblings and Jennifer's family
    And prevent one partner from being overwhelmed by elder care
    And recognize that elder care is shared household responsibility
    And support them in managing care without destroying their partnership
