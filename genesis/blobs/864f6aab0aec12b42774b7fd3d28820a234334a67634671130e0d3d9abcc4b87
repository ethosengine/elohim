Scenario: Analyzing national Constitutional Council precedent development
    Given National Constitutional Council has created precedents affecting millions
    And I have access to five years of national-level decisions
    When I analyze how constitutional interpretation evolves over time
    Then I examine: consistency of principles across diverse cases
    And I track: precedent citation patterns and influence
    And I identify: watershed decisions that reshaped interpretation
    And I analyze: how dissenting opinions influence future majorities
    And I assess: whether interpretation drifts from constitutional text
    And I explore: emergence of constitutional "common law" through cases
    And My research reveals: how citizen governance creates coherent jurisprudence
