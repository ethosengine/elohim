Scenario: Facilitate inter-neighborhood dialogue on shared challenges
    Given neighborhoods have conflicting priorities
    And downtown wants nightlife economy
    And residential areas want noise reduction
    When Municipal Elohim identifies the conflict
    Then Jamal convenes inter-neighborhood deliberative assembly
    And assembly uses Polis-style clustering to find common ground
    And assembly develops solution: nightlife district with sound barriers
    And neighborhoods collaborate rather than compete
    And municipal scale enables solutions impossible at neighborhood level
