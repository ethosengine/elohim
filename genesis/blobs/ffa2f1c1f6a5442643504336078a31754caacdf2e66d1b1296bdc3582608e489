Scenario: Family member appeals on behalf of vulnerable member
    Given my elderly parent cannot file appeal themselves due to cognitive limitations
    And I believe Family Elohim's decision doesn't serve their best interests
    When I file an appeal as their representative
    Then I must demonstrate my authority to represent them
    And The appeal process ensures I'm serving their interests not mine
    And The Constitutional Council evaluates if the agent properly considered vulnerability
    And They examine if dignity was preserved despite cognitive limitations
    And The appeal includes safeguards against family members exploiting representation
