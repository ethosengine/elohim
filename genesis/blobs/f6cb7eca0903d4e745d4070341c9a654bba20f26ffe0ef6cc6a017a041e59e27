Scenario: Educational privacy protects learning data from exploitation
    Given Aisha's learning patterns generate valuable data
    And educational data is often exploited commercially
    When educational data is collected
    Then it must be used only to improve educational outcomes
    And Aisha's privacy must be absolutely protected
    And no commercial exploitation of learning data should occur
    And data should serve her learning, not surveillance capitalism
    And educational privacy must be maintained
    And learning should never be monetized
