Scenario: Climate impact of dietary choices
    Given food production contributes to climate change
    And individual choices aggregate to systemic impact
    When Aisha evaluates food options
    Then the bioregional_elohim should show carbon footprint
    And it should explain climate impact of different choices
    And it should help her make lower-impact selections
    And climate literacy should inform dietary decisions
    And she should understand individual contribution to climate crisis
    And climate-conscious choices should be supported
