Scenario: Advising on national security vs constitutional rights tension
    Given appeal involves claimed national security justification
    And technical assessment is needed of security claims
    When I evaluate security-rights tradeoff technically
    Then I assess: whether claimed vulnerability is technically legitimate
    And I explore: whether less rights-violating technical alternatives exist
    And I examine: whether proposed security measure would actually work
    And I clarify: technical reality vs security theater
    And I avoid: dismissing security needs or exaggerating threats
    And I provide: honest technical assessment
    And I let: council judge values tradeoff given technical facts
