Scenario: Shopping locally contributes to neighborhood economy
    Given Kenji buys groceries at neighborhood corner store and farmer's market
    And local shopping supports neighborhood businesses
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks local economic participation
    Then it should recognize Kenji's local purchases as neighborhood contribution
    And it should show him "You've spent $X at local businesses this month"
    And it should help him understand his economic impact on neighborhood
    And local shopping should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should make visible how spending choices support community
    And students should see themselves as neighborhood economic participants
