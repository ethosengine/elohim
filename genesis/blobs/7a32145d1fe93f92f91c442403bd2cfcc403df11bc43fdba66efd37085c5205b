Scenario: Neighborhood care tokens value Alex's substantial contributions
    Given Alex contributes significantly to neighborhood care economy
    And traditional metrics don't capture accessibility advocacy value
    When neighborhood care tokens are calculated
    Then Alex's barrier documentation should accumulate tokens
    And Alex's mutual aid participation should be valued appropriately
    And Alex's disability expertise shared with neighbors should count
    And Alex's organizing work should generate care economy standing
    And care tokens should position Alex as neighborhood contributor
    And Alex should be able to access neighborhood resources based on contributions
    And the protocol should make Alex's neighborhood value undeniable
