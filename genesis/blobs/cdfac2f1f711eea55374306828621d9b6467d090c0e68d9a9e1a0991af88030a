Scenario: Adult learns to recognize and value her own care contributions
    Given Sarah has internalized that parenting is "not working"
    And society devalues the care labor she performs
    When Sarah uses the Value Scanner over time
    Then she should develop new understanding of her contributions
    And she should see meal planning, emotional labor, household coordination as valuable work
    And quantified care contributions should shift her self-concept
    And she should gain language to articulate her care work to others
    And cultural transformation should begin with Sarah's own understanding
