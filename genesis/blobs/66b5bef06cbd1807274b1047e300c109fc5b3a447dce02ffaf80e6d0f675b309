Scenario: Personal agent provides cognitive support without replacement
    Given Helen experiences memory challenges from early-stage dementia
    And she needs reminders for medications and appointments
    When Helen's personal_agent provides cognitive assistance
    Then it should support her memory without replacing her agency
    And medication reminders should be gentle: "Helen, time for your heart medication"
    And appointment notifications should give adequate lead time
    And the agent should repeat information patiently when needed
    And support should feel like partnership, not management
    And Helen should remain the decision-maker about her own life
    And the agent must never make choices for Helen without explicit delegation
