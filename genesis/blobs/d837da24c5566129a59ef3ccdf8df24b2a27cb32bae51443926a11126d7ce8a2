Scenario: Community legal aid for caregiver navigation needs
    Given James needs advance directives, power of attorney, possibly guardianship
    And legal services are expensive and complex
    When the community_elohim connects to legal resources
    Then legal aid should be accessible based on care contributions
    And attorneys should understand caregiver-specific needs
    And legal navigation should be supported through care economy
    And community should ensure caregivers access legal protections
    And legal complexity should not be impossible barrier
