Scenario: Community volunteering contributions quantified and recognized
    Given Margaret volunteers 10 hours/week across community organizations
    And this represents ~500 hours/year of community labor
    When the community_elohim tracks volunteer contributions
    Then all volunteer hours should be quantified and valued
    And the economic value of her labor should be calculated
    And community care tokens should accumulate to reflect contributions
    And Margaret's productivity should be visible despite retirement status
    And the narrative that retirees "don't work" should be countered
    And her community standing should reflect her contributions
