Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Senior
  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want my community contributions to be recognized and my experience to inform governance
  So that seniors are valued as productive community members building care economy infrastructure

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the senior user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret volunteers 10 hours/week in community organizations
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim coordinates community care economy
    And Margaret has decades of community involvement and knowledge

  Scenario: Community volunteering contributions quantified and recognized
    Given Margaret volunteers 10 hours/week across community organizations
    And this represents ~500 hours/year of community labor
    When the community_elohim tracks volunteer contributions
    Then all volunteer hours should be quantified and valued
    And the economic value of her labor should be calculated
    And community care tokens should accumulate to reflect contributions
    And Margaret's productivity should be visible despite retirement status
    And the narrative that retirees "don't work" should be countered
    And her community standing should reflect her contributions

  Scenario: Senior experience and knowledge informs community governance
    Given Margaret has decades of community involvement
    And she understands local history, patterns, and relationships
    When community decisions are being made
    Then Margaret's knowledge should be actively solicited
    And her voice should carry weight in governance processes
    And senior wisdom should inform community planning
    And decades of experience should be treated as valuable resource
    And community governance should benefit from long-term perspective
    And Margaret should have legitimate authority in civic decisions

  Scenario: Building care economy infrastructure at community scale
    Given Margaret has time and motivation to build new systems
    And care economy requires infrastructure development
    When the community_elohim coordinates care economy building
    Then Margaret should be identified as potential infrastructure builder
    And her generation could establish care economy as normal practice
    And seniors could be powerful advocates and practitioners
    And community care economy infrastructure should be senior-led
    And Margaret's cohort could transform how community operates
    And systemic change should be enabled through senior participation

  Scenario: Food bank volunteering with dignity for participants
    Given Margaret volunteers at community food bank
    And she also uses food bank resources on her limited budget
    When the community_elohim coordinates food access
    Then Margaret should both contribute and receive without stigma
    And the framing should be community resource sharing, not charity
    And her volunteer labor should give her standing as member, not supplicant
    And she should experience dignity in both giving and receiving
    And community food access should operate on mutual aid principles
    And Margaret should be valued contributor regardless of income

  Scenario: Mentoring younger community members and leaders
    Given Margaret has professional experience and life wisdom
    And younger adults benefit from mentoring
    When the community_elohim facilitates mentoring connections
    Then Margaret should be connected to mentees
    And her knowledge should be passed to next generation
    And the mentoring labor should be tracked as care contribution
    And intergenerational knowledge transmission should be valued
    And Margaret's experience should serve community capacity-building
    And younger leaders should benefit from senior guidance

  Scenario: Community board and committee participation
    Given Margaret has time to attend meetings and do board work
    And community organizations need committed board members
    When Margaret participates in community governance
    Then her board service should be tracked as significant labor
    And the time, preparation, and decision-making should be quantified
    And community leadership contributions should be visible
    And Margaret's governance participation should be valued
    And seniors should be recognized as having capacity for leadership
    And her contributions should build community governance systems

  Scenario: Coordinating community resource sharing and mutual aid
    Given Margaret has organizational skills and available time
    And community needs coordination of sharing networks
    When the community_elohim facilitates resource coordination
    Then Margaret should be identified as potential coordinator
    And her labor in coordinating should be recognized and valued
    And community resource sharing should reduce individual scarcity
    And Margaret's organizational contributions should strengthen community
    And her time availability should serve collective benefit
    And coordination labor should be visible and appreciated

  Scenario: Senior-to-senior support and community building
    Given Margaret is in "younger" senior cohort (65-74)
    And older seniors (75+) need support and connection
    When the community_elohim coordinates senior support
    Then Margaret should be part of senior mutual aid networks
    And her peer support should be recognized as care contribution
    And senior-to-senior care should prevent isolation
    And age-matched support should be valued alongside intergenerational
    And senior community should be strengthened through care economy
    And Margaret should build relationships with peers

  Scenario: Community advocacy for senior issues and care economy
    Given Margaret understands both care economy and senior needs
    And community policy affects senior quality of life
    When the community_elohim supports advocacy efforts
    Then Margaret should be connected to senior advocacy
    And her voice should inform policy on retirement, care, and aging
    And care economy principles should be advanced through advocacy
    And seniors should organize for systemic change
    And Margaret's generation could reshape retirement policy
    And political power should be built through care economy visibility

  Scenario: Community food systems and nutrition access for seniors
    Given Margaret manages nutrition on limited budget
    And community food systems affect senior health
    When the community_elohim coordinates food access
    Then Margaret should help shape senior-appropriate food programs
    And her needs and knowledge should inform program design
    And community should ensure affordable nutritious food for seniors
    And Margaret should influence resource allocation
    And senior nutritional needs should be community priority
    And her participation should improve services for all seniors

  Scenario: Cultural and artistic contributions to community life
    Given Margaret has time for cultural and creative pursuits
    And community cultural life requires participation
    When Margaret engages in community cultural activities
    Then her participation and leadership should be tracked
    And cultural contributions should be recognized as care work
    And community flourishing includes cultural richness
    And Margaret's creative labor should be valued
    And seniors should be visible in community cultural life
    And arts and culture should be part of care economy

  Scenario: Making aggregate senior contributions visible at community scale
    Given thousands of seniors make similar contributions
    And their collective labor is massive but invisible
    When the community_elohim aggregates senior care contributions
    Then the community should see total senior care economy value
    And data should show seniors as highly productive population
    And cultural narratives about retirement should be challenged
    And policy should reflect actual senior contributions
    And community should recognize dependence on senior labor
    And visibility could transform attitudes about aging and retirement
