Scenario: Elder's institutional memory aids community decision
    Given the neighborhood is debating a proposed development
    And there are questions about past flooding patterns
    When Rose contributes her memory of the 1995 flood
    And she describes how the proposed site was underwater
    Then her historical knowledge is valued in the discussion
    And her contribution earns reach based on relevance and credibility
    And the community makes better-informed decisions
    And Rose experiences being an essential community asset
    And institutional memory is preserved and utilized
