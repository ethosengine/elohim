Scenario: Appeal includes community context testimony
    Given I filed an appeal that requires local knowledge to understand
    And the Constitutional Council needs community context
    When Community Leader provides testimony about local circumstances
    Then the leader explains relevant history, cultural factors, and relationships
    And The context helps council understand what might seem unusual to outsiders
    And The leader doesn't advocate for outcome, just provides information
    And The council weighs local context alongside constitutional principles
    And Community knowledge enriches constitutional interpretation
    And My appeal benefits from those who understand our community deeply
