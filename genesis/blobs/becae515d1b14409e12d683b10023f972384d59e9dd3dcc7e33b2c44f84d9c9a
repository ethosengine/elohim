Scenario: Professional identity maintained alongside disability identity
    Given Alex is a skilled data analyst with professional expertise
    And disability is part of Alex's identity but doesn't define professional capability
    When workplace interactions occur
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex be seen as competent professional
    And it should support Alex in asserting expertise and professional standing
    And disability should not overshadow Alex's professional contributions
    And Alex should be respected for skills and knowledge
    And the protocol should help balance disability advocacy with professional identity
    And Alex should not have to choose between being professional and being disabled
    And both identities should be honored simultaneously
