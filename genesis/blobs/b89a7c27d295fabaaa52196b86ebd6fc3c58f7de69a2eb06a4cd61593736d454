Scenario: Educational governance includes parent and teacher voices
    Given Sarah is both parent and teacher
    And educational governance affects her professionally and personally
    When educational policy decisions are made
    Then Sarah should have voice from both perspectives
    And parent care contributions should influence school policy
    And teacher care contributions should shape education governance
    And educational democracy should include those who do education care work
    And Sarah's dual perspective should be valued in governance
