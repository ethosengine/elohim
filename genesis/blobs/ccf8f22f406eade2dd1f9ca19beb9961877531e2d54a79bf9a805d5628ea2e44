Scenario: Developer receives honest school capacity analysis
    Given a developer proposes 300-unit residential development
    And claims it will bring tax revenue benefiting schools
    When the Observer provides independent school impact analysis
    Then the developer sees: project will generate 180 school-age children
    And local elementary school is already at 95% capacity
    And district needs $12M to expand capacity for projected enrollment
    And property tax revenue is $800K/year but school costs are $1.5M/year
    And honest analysis reveals net burden on school system
