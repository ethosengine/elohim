Scenario: Sandwich generation care burden made visible across family
    Given James cares simultaneously for spouse and aging parent
    And he provides intensive care in both directions
    When the family_elohim tracks James's care contributions
    Then his care work for David should be quantified fully
    And his care coordination for his mother should be visible
    And extended family should see his dual care burden
    And sandwich generation reality should be recognized explicitly
    And family should understand the overwhelming scope of James's labor
    And visibility should enable family support rather than more demands
