Scenario: Parent coordinates district-wide program cut opposition
    Given the district plans to eliminate music programs to save money
    And the parent's child participates in the school band
    When the Observer connects parents across all affected schools
    Then 230 parents from 8 schools join coordinated advocacy
    And coalition presents unified data on music program benefits
    And shows alternative cost-saving options that preserve programs
    And district-wide parent power prevents divide-and-conquer
    And music programs are preserved through collective action
