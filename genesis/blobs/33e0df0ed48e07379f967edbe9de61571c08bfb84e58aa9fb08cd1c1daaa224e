Scenario: Recognition of self-care as care work
    Given Aisha tends to prioritize work over personal needs
    And burnout would undermine all her capabilities
    When the personal_agent monitors her well-being
    Then it should recognize self-care as legitimate care work
    And it should flag when self-care is being neglected
    And it should help her understand that caring for herself enables other contributions
    And the system should validate rest and nutrition as valuable
    And Aisha should learn that personal stewardship is foundational
