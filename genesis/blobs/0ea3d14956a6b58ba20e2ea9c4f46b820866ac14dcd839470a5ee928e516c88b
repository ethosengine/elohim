Scenario: Community board and committee participation
    Given Margaret has time to attend meetings and do board work
    And community organizations need committed board members
    When Margaret participates in community governance
    Then her board service should be tracked as significant labor
    And the time, preparation, and decision-making should be quantified
    And community leadership contributions should be visible
    And Margaret's governance participation should be valued
    And seniors should be recognized as having capacity for leadership
    And her contributions should build community governance systems
