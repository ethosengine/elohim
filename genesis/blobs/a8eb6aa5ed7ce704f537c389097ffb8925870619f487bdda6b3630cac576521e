Scenario: Mutual aid practices from disability community inform ecological resilience
    Given disabled people have deep expertise in mutual aid
    And ecological resilience requires community cooperation
    When the bioregional_elohim models community resilience
    Then it should learn from disability community mutual aid practices
    And Alex's experience with peer support should inform ecological organizing
    And disability community's interdependence should model ecological relationships
    And the protocol should recognize disability community as resilience experts
    And mutual aid frameworks should be applied to ecological challenges
    And Alex's knowledge should strengthen bioregional resilience
    And disability justice practices should inform ecological care economy
