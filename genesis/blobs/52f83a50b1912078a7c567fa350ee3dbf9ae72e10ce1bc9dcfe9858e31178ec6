Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Senior
  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want my ecological knowledge to be valued and sustainability practices to be supported
  So that senior wisdom about frugality and stewardship serves bioregional flourishing

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the senior user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret's generation has knowledge of waste reduction and resource conservation
    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active
    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates ecological care practices
    And Margaret's frugality aligns with ecological sustainability

  Scenario: Senior knowledge of waste reduction valued as ecological wisdom
    Given Margaret's generation learned to minimize waste
    And reducing waste is both budget necessity and ecological imperative
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks waste reduction practices
    Then Margaret's waste minimization should be recognized
    And her knowledge of using everything should be valued
    And practices like saving containers, composting scraps should be tracked
    And generational wisdom should inform community sustainability
    And frugality should be reframed as ecological stewardship
    And Margaret's practices should be teaching resource for younger generations

  Scenario: Food preservation skills as bioregional care contribution
    Given Margaret knows how to preserve food through canning, freezing, drying
    And food preservation reduces waste and builds food security
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food preservation
    Then Margaret's preservation labor should be quantified
    And skills should be recognized as ecological care contribution
    And preserved food reduces reliance on industrial food systems
    And Margaret's knowledge should be shared with community
    And traditional preservation techniques should be valued
    And bioregional food resilience should be strengthened by senior knowledge

  Scenario: Buying quality that lasts reduces ecological impact
    Given Margaret learned to buy fewer, better things
    And durability reduces waste and resource extraction
    When Margaret makes purchasing decisions
    Then her personal_agent should support quality-over-quantity choices
    And the bioregional_elohim should track durability practices
    And buying quality should be recognized as ecological stewardship
    And Margaret's knowledge of durability should inform others
    And consumption patterns should favor longevity
    And throwaway culture should be countered by senior wisdom

  Scenario: Seasonal eating patterns support bioregional food systems
    Given Margaret shops for seasonal produce
    And seasonal eating reduces food miles and supports local agriculture
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food choices
    Then seasonal eating patterns should be recognized
    And Margaret's choices should support bioregional food systems
    And local, seasonal food should be prioritized in recommendations
    And eating with seasons should be encouraged and facilitated
    And bioregional awareness should develop through practice
    And Margaret's food choices should strengthen local food economy

  Scenario: Garden and food growing knowledge shared across generations
    Given Margaret may grow some of her own food
    And gardening knowledge is both ecological and practical
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates food growing
    Then Margaret's gardening should be recognized as care contribution
    And growing food reduces industrial agriculture dependence
    And her knowledge should be shared with neighbors and family
    And community gardens should connect seniors with others
    And food growing should be supported as ecological practice
    And Margaret's skills should strengthen community food security

  Scenario: Repair and mending skills reduce waste
    Given Margaret knows how to repair clothing, household items, equipment
    And repair culture counters disposability
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks repair practices
    Then Margaret's mending and repair should be recognized
    And skills should be valued as ecological care contribution
    And repair knowledge should be shared with younger generations
    And community repair culture should be strengthened
    And disposability should be countered by repair practices
    And Margaret's skills should serve bioregional sustainability

  Scenario: Bulk buying and package reduction practices
    Given Margaret learned to buy bulk to reduce packaging
    And package reduction serves both budget and ecology
    When Margaret shops with minimal packaging
    Then the bioregional_elohim should track packaging reduction
    And bulk buying should be recognized as ecological practice
    And Margaret's practices should inform community purchasing
    And package waste should be minimized
    And bioregional resource flows should be optimized
    And frugality should align with ecological goals

  Scenario: Walking and public transit use reduces carbon footprint
    Given Margaret can no longer afford car ownership
    And walking/transit use serves ecological goals
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks transportation patterns
    Then Margaret's low-carbon mobility should be recognized
    And walking should be valued as ecological choice
    And public transit use should be supported and facilitated
    And her mobility patterns should serve bioregional sustainability
    And car-free living should be honored as ecological stewardship
    And economic constraint should be reframed as ecological virtue

  Scenario: Teaching younger generations about resource conservation
    Given Margaret has decades of conservation knowledge
    And younger generations need sustainable living skills
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates knowledge sharing
    Then Margaret should teach conservation practices
    And her knowledge should be transmitted to younger people
    And teaching should be recognized as ecological care contribution
    And intergenerational knowledge transfer should strengthen sustainability
    And senior wisdom should inform bioregional practices
    And ecological education should flow from elder experience

  Scenario: Bioregional food knowledge and local food traditions
    Given Margaret knows local food traditions and seasonal patterns
    And bioregional food culture strengthens local systems
    When the bioregional_elohim supports food culture
    Then Margaret's knowledge of local foods should be valued
    And traditional food practices should be preserved and shared
    And local food culture should be taught to younger generations
    And bioregional identity should be strengthened through food
    And Margaret's cultural food knowledge should serve community
    And food traditions should connect people to place

  Scenario: Foraging and wild food knowledge
    Given Margaret may know local wild and foraged foods
    And foraging connects people to bioregion and reduces food costs
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates wild food knowledge
    Then Margaret's foraging knowledge should be recognized
    And safe foraging practices should be shared
    And wild food resources should be sustainably utilized
    And bioregional food diversity should be enhanced
    And Margaret's knowledge should strengthen food security
    And connection to land should be deepened through foraging

  Scenario: Climate adaptation knowledge from lived experience
    Given Margaret has observed environmental changes over decades
    And adaptation requires long-term observation
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates climate adaptation
    Then Margaret's observations should inform adaptation strategies
    And her knowledge of changing patterns should be valued
    And long-term perspective should shape bioregional planning
    And senior experience should guide community resilience
    And climate adaptation should benefit from elder wisdom
    And Margaret's lifetime of observation should serve collective response
