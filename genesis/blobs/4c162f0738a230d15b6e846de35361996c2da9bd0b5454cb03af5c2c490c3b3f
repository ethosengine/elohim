Scenario: Advocating for care-economy-aligned workplace policies
    Given my workplace treats me as labor unit without care needs
    When I want to advocate for care-supportive policies
    Then the protocol should help me propose specific policies
    Such as paid sick leave, predictable scheduling, living wages, meal provisions
    And provide evidence for why these policies support workers' flourishing
    And help me communicate needs to management
    And support pushing for workplace transformation
