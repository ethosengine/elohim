Scenario: Building neighborhood safety through mutual care
    Given neighborhoods are safer when residents know each other
    And Aisha wants to feel secure in her new home
    When Aisha participates in neighborhood care networks
    Then the connections should build mutual familiarity
    And the neighborhood_elohim should strengthen social fabric
    And care relationships should create natural neighborhood watch
    And safety should emerge from community bonds
    And the system should build security through care, not surveillance
