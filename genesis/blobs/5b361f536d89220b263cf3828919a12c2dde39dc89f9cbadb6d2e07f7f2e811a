Scenario: Operator experiences relief from dual extraction trap
    Given corporate extracts from above (fees, mandatory purchasing, controlled pricing)
    And profitability required worker extraction from below (low wages, speedup, surveillance)
    When EAE conversion eliminates corporate extraction entirely
    Then $100K+ annually per location is freed from franchise fees and markups
    And workers receive substantial wage increases without threatening sustainability
    And James escapes impossible position of implementing exploitation he knows is harmful
    And dual extraction trap that made ethical operation impossible is broken
    And workplace_elohim documents liberation from extraction on both levels
