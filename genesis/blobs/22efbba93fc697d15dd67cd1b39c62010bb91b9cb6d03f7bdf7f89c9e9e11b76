Scenario: Balancing neighborhood participation with student time constraints
    Given Kenji has limited time between school and work
    And neighborhood participation requires time investment
    When the neighborhood_elohim helps Kenji manage participation
    Then it should help him identify high-impact, low-time contributions
    And it should validate that he can't participate in everything
    And it should show: "30 minutes at neighborhood meeting = valuable contribution"
    And participation should be realistic for student schedules
    And the system should enable partial participation as valid
    And students should participate at sustainable levels
