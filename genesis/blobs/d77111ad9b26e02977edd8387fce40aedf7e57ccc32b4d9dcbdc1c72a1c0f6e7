Scenario: Municipal transit and urban planning responsive to teen needs
    Given Jasmine relies on public transit and walkable neighborhoods
    And urban planning decisions affect her daily mobility
    When the municipality makes transit and planning decisions
    Then youth input should be actively solicited through municipal_elohim
    And Jasmine's lived experience should inform planning
    And teen mobility needs should shape transit routing and scheduling
    And safe walking and biking infrastructure should reflect youth usage patterns
    And municipal planning should recognize teens as legitimate urban space users
    And age-friendly cities should include teen-friendly design
