Scenario: Demonstrating visible community benefit for reelection
    Given I face reelection and need to show protocol serves Riverside
    And residents judge me on outcomes not philosophy
    When I present annual protocol review to community
    Then I show: data on wellbeing improvements (loneliness down, satisfaction up)
    And I report: crisis response effectiveness and economic resilience
    And I acknowledge: failures and challenges honestly
    And I demonstrate: transparent accountability
    And I propose: continuing with recommended calibrations
    And residents vote: 68% to continue (not consensus but democratic)
    And I remain accountable: through normal democratic processes
    And evidence matters: for sustaining political support
