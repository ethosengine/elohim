Scenario: Municipal planning includes middle-aged caregiver voice
    Given Robert represents large demographic managing multigenerational care
    And municipal planning often misses caregiver needs
    And his experience could improve municipal systems
    When municipal_elohim connects him to planning processes
    Then it should identify municipal planning opportunities
    And help him participate in comprehensive planning, transportation planning, and housing policy
    And surface how planning decisions affect caregivers
    And advocate for aging-in-place infrastructure, accessible transportation, and multigenerational housing
    And ensure municipal planning reflects caregiver perspectives
    And build municipalities that support care economy
    And recognize that planning should serve actual resident needs
