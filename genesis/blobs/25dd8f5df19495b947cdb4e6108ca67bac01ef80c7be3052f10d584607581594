Scenario: Repair and reuse culture born of necessity
    Given Maria cannot afford to replace items frequently
    And she repairs, maintains, and extends the life of possessions
    When household consumption patterns are tracked
    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify her repair and reuse practices
    And it should celebrate her circular economy participation
    And her repair culture should be valued as waste reduction
    And economic necessity should be reframed as environmental leadership
    And Maria should see herself as exemplifying sustainable consumption
