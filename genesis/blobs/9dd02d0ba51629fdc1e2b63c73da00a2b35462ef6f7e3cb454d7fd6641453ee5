Scenario: Preregistration of hypotheses to prevent cherry-picking results
    Given I want my research to be scientifically credible
    And I know publication bias favors positive findings
    When I design my regional study
    Then I preregister: hypotheses before seeing the data
    And I commit: to reporting all results not just flattering ones
    And I plan: analysis methods in advance to prevent p-hacking
    And I document: any deviations from preregistered plan with justification
    And I publish: null results and failures alongside successes
    And My methodological rigor maintains: scientific integrity over advocacy
    And Credibility comes from: honesty about what works and what doesn't
