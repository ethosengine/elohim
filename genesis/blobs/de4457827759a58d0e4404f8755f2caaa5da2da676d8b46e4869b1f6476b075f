Scenario: Journalist investigates workplace safety violations
    Given workers report unsafe conditions at warehouse
    And the journalist covers workplace safety
    When the Observer analyzes employer's safety violation history
    Then the journalist finds company has 47 OSHA violations in 5 years
    And sees pattern of violations detected but minimally fined
    And documents worker injuries and company's inadequate response
    And shows same company violates safety rules at facilities in other states
    And publishes investigation forcing regulatory accountability
