Scenario: Personal agent recognizes parent as individual beyond caregiving role
    Given Sarah has been performing intensive care labor all day
    And she has attended to children's needs, household needs, and work needs
    When Sarah's personal_agent assesses her daily patterns
    Then the agent should recognize Sarah as a person with individual needs
    And the agent should prompt "When did you last do something just for yourself?"
    And the system should validate that self-care enables care for others
    And Sarah should be reminded that she exists beyond her caregiving roles
    And individual identity should be actively preserved
    And the agent should protect space for Sarah's autonomous personhood
