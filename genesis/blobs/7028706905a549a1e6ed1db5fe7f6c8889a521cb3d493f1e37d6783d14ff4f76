Scenario: Spousal care recognized as professional-grade family contribution
    Given James provides skilled nursing-level care for David
    And this care is rendered invisible because they're married
    When the family_elohim evaluates James's spousal care
    Then it should be valued at professional care rates
    And care tokens should reflect $50k+/year equivalent value
    And "caring for spouse out of love" should not erase economic value
    And family should recognize James is doing professional work
    And spousal caregiving should be visible as enormous contribution
    And marriage should not make care work economically invisible
