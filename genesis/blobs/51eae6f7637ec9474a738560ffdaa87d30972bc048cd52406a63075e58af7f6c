Scenario: Frugality as environmental practice recognized and valued
    Given Helen's resource constraint requires careful consumption
    And frugality reduces environmental impact
    When Helen makes resource-conscious decisions
    Then her frugality should be recognized as environmental stewardship
    And poverty should not be stigmatized when it reduces consumption
    And her low-impact lifestyle should be valued, not pitied
    And care tokens should reflect environmental benefit of reduced consumption
    And the protocol should challenge assumption that consumption equals flourishing
    And Helen's economic constraint should be reframed as ecological wisdom
    And environmental movement should learn from those who live with less by necessity
