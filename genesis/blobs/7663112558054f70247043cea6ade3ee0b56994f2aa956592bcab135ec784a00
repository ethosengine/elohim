Scenario: Personal nutrition maintained despite overwhelming demands
    Given James often skips meals while caring for David
    And his nutrition suffers under caregiving pressure
    When the personal_agent monitors James's eating patterns
    Then it should recognize inadequate nutrition
    And it should prompt meal planning that includes James
    And it should ensure James maintains basic nutrition
    And his well-being should be prioritized alongside David's
    And the protocol should prevent James's health decline
