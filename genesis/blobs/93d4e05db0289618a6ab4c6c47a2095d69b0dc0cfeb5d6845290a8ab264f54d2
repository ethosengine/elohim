Scenario: Household schedule coordination across four people
    Given Sarah coordinates schedules for herself, partner, Tommy, and Emma
    And everyone has different needs, activities, and constraints
    When Sarah manages the family calendar
    Then the household_elohim should recognize this as complex coordination
    And it should track the cognitive labor of schedule management
    And it should value the dozens of micro-decisions required
    And Sarah's coordination work should be made visible
    And schedule management should accumulate significant care tokens
    And this invisible orchestration should be recognized as skilled work
