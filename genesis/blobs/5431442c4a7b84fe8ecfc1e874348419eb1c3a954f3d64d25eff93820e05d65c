Scenario: Privacy control remains with Margaret as autonomous adult
    Given Margaret's care contribution data is being tracked
    And health information is particularly sensitive
    When Margaret determines data sharing preferences
    Then she must have complete control over all her data
    And she should choose what's shared with family, doctors, or community
    And she can demonstrate care value to family if she wishes
    And she can maintain complete privacy if she prefers
    And health data sharing must be explicitly consented
    And Margaret's autonomy over her information must be absolute
