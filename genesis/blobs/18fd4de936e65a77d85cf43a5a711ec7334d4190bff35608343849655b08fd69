Scenario: Privacy protection for parent's personal life
    Given Sarah's care work generates extensive data
    And she has full privacy rights as an individual
    When care economy data is collected
    Then Sarah must have complete control over her personal information
    And no third party access should be permitted without explicit consent
    And her parenting patterns should not be monetized
    And the system should protect her from surveillance capitalism
    And privacy should be default, not opt-in
    And Sarah's dignity should be protected through data sovereignty
