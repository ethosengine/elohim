Scenario: Sustainable living adapted for disability access
    Given sustainable practices are often designed without disability consideration
    And inaccessible sustainability excludes disabled people
    When sustainable living practices are promoted
    Then the bioregional_elohim should ensure practices are disability-accessible
    And composting, gardening, conservation should be adaptable for various capabilities
    And Alex should be able to participate in ecological practices
    And sustainable living should work for diverse bodies and minds
    And the protocol should advocate for inclusive environmental practices
    And disability expertise should improve sustainability design
    And Alex's participation should be welcomed and supported
