Scenario: Workers recall underperforming coordinator through democratic process
    Given Marcus transitioned from manager to democratic coordinator
    And workers have expressed concerns about his facilitation effectiveness
    When workers initiate a recall process
    Then workplace_elohim facilitates a fair evaluation process
    And Marcus receives specific feedback on coordination failures
    And workers vote on recall with 2/3 supermajority required
    And if recalled, Marcus transitions gracefully with support for next role
    And democratic accountability prevents hierarchical abuse
