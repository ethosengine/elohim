Scenario: Politician evaluates workplace safety regulations with evidence
    Given business lobby opposes workplace safety regulations
    And claims compliance costs will harm competitiveness
    When the Observer analyzes workplace safety data and regulatory impacts
    Then they see injury and fatality rates in regulated versus unregulated contexts
    And understand compliance costs versus worker compensation and healthcare costs
    And identify which safety regulations most effectively prevent harm
    And review enforcement patterns and violation rates
    And make evidence-based decisions prioritizing worker safety
