Scenario: Rapid appeal review during regional crisis
    Given a regional crisis requires many urgent agent decisions
    And I need to appeal a crisis-related decision quickly
    When Regional Constitutional Council convenes emergency session
    Then they balance speed with deliberation quality
    And They evaluate if emergency protocols were properly invoked
    And They examine if crisis urgency justified departures from normal process
    And They provide expedited review (48-72 hours) while maintaining rigor
    And They create precedent for crisis governance
    And My appeal ensures democratic accountability even under emergency conditions
