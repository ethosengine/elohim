Scenario: Crafting enabling legislation protecting protocol sovereignty
    Given I want to support democratic AI governance
    And I must integrate protocol with existing state law
    When I draft AI governance legislation
    Then I create: legal recognition of Constitutional Council authority
    And I establish: state funding for community protocol infrastructure
    And I mandate: interoperability between government systems and protocol
    And I protect: communities from corporate capture attempts
    And I ensure: equitable access for poor communities
    And my legislation: enables rather than controls protocol
    And I empower: community sovereignty within legal framework
