    And there's no backup adult if something happens to her
    When the household_elohim assesses resilience
    Then it should help Maria create emergency plans for if she's incapacitated
    And it should identify emergency contacts for children
    And it should coordinate with extended family or community for backup care
    And it should ensure children know what to do in various emergencies
    And Maria should have peace of mind that children will be cared for if she can't
