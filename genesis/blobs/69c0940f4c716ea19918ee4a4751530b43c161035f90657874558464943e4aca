Scenario: Household energy and resource use optimization
    Given Sarah manages household energy and resource consumption
    And reducing usage requires conscious effort and planning
    When the ecological_elohim tracks resource management
    Then it should recognize Sarah's work to minimize consumption
    And it should value conservation as care labor
    And it should quantify environmental benefit of reduced usage
    And resource management should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should recognize ecological household management
    And Sarah's environmental care work should be visible and valued
