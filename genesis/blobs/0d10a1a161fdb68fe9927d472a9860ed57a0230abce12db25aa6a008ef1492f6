Scenario: Coordination of support services with Alex maintaining authority
    Given Alex requires assistance with some physical tasks
    And Alex coordinates support workers for specific needs
    When support services are scheduled
    Then Alex should have complete authority over service direction
    And the personal_agent should help coordinate schedules efficiently
    And Alex should be able to communicate needs clearly
    And support quality should be tracked per Alex's assessment
    And Alex should experience professional partnership, not caretaking
    And the relationship should be employer/coordinator to service provider
    And Alex's autonomy should be structurally protected
