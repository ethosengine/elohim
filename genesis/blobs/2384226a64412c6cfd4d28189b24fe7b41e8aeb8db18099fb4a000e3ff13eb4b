Scenario: Parent participation in school governance and advocacy
    Given Sarah participates in school board meetings and parent committees
    And she advocates for better educational policies
    When the community_elohim tracks Sarah's civic engagement
    Then it should recognize school participation as care labor
    And advocacy for children's education should accumulate care tokens
    And parent organizing should be valued as political work
    And Sarah's effort to improve schools should be community contribution
    And the system should recognize that parents are primary education stakeholders
    And civic labor should be visible and valued
