Scenario: Distributing household tasks based on capacity
    Given different household members have different time and energy
    And my work leaves me with minimal capacity
    When we allocate household responsibilities
    Then the protocol should suggest distribution based on actual capacity
    And recognize that my 50+ hour work week limits my availability
    And propose fair alternatives when I can't do time-intensive tasks
    And help us find equitable arrangements
