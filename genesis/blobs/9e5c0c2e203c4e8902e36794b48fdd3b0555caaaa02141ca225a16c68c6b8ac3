Scenario: School board member evaluates charter school proposal with evidence
    Given charter organization proposes new school in district
    And presents compelling student achievement promises
    When the Observer analyzes charter track record
    Then they see organization's student outcomes in other cities
    And learn whether achievement gains account for selective enrollment
    And understand fiscal impact on district schools
    And review discipline and expulsion rates for vulnerable students
    And make informed decision on charter authorization
