Scenario: Explaining pattern detection without overwhelming council
    Given complex machine learning algorithm detected Marcus's risk pattern
    And council needs to understand how this works
    When I explain pattern recognition in accessible terms
    Then I describe: what data the agent analyzed
    And I clarify: how patterns are detected across multiple factors
    And I explain: what makes this pattern concerning vs normal variation
    And I provide: counterfactuals showing what would change the outcome
    And I avoid: technical details that don't serve constitutional judgment
    And I ensure: council grasps enough to evaluate constitutional alignment
    And I respect: that they don't need to be machine learning experts
