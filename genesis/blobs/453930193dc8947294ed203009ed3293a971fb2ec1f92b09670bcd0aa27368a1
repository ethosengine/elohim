Scenario: Teacher connects working conditions to student learning
    Given administrators claim teacher working conditions are "employee issues"
    And dismiss working condition advocacy as self-interested
    When teachers document connection between conditions and student outcomes
    Then data shows schools with better planning time have better student results
    And adequate support staff correlates with student wellbeing
    And sustainable teacher workload predicts teacher retention and student consistency
    And working conditions advocacy is reframed as student-centered
    And labor rights and educational quality become aligned not opposed
