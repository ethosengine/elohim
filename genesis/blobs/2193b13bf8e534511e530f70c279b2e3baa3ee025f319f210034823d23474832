Scenario: Parent recognized as child's primary educator
    Given Sarah teaches Tommy and Emma continuously at home
    And she is their first and most influential teacher
    When the educational_elohim tracks educational contributions
    Then it should recognize Sarah's parenting as educational work
    And it should value home education alongside school education
    And Sarah's teaching labor should accumulate care tokens
    And parents should be understood as primary educators
    And schools should be partners in education, not replacements for parents
    And the system should make parent educational labor visible
