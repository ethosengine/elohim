Scenario: Neighborhood mutual aid network provides crisis support
    Given Sarah or her neighbors may face crises
    And traditional systems often fail to provide timely support
    When a household experiences emergency
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should activate mutual aid network
    And neighbors with capacity should be prompted to help
    And support should be immediate and community-based
    And neighborhood should function as first-line safety net
    And mutual aid should be coordinated effectively
