Feature: Community Board Governance for Board Member
  As a board member serving on a community or neighborhood board in the public_observer system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want hyperlocal data and community input to inform decisions
  So that I can represent diverse neighborhood interests and connect local needs to broader governance

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the board_member user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active
    And I am a volunteer serving on neighborhood council, community advisory board, or local school site council

  Scenario: School site council member evaluates school improvement plan priorities
    Given principal proposes improvement plan focusing on technology upgrades
    And plan must be approved by site council including parent and teacher representatives
    And board member wants to ensure plan reflects actual community priorities
    When the board member requests Observer community input data
    Then they receive parent survey data showing concerns about class sizes and counseling
    And see teacher feedback emphasizing professional development needs
    And access student outcome data showing literacy and math support gaps
    And discover technology upgrades not mentioned in community feedback
    And community accountability helps council prioritize authentic local needs

  Scenario: Neighborhood council member understands local conditions for district advocacy
    Given neighborhood has concerns about park maintenance and safety
    And council wants to advocate to city parks department for improvements
    And needs data to support request competing with other neighborhoods
    When the council member uses Observer hyperlocal analysis
    Then they receive documentation of park condition deterioration over time
    And see usage data showing high community demand despite poor conditions
    And access comparison to park investment in other neighborhoods
    And get demographic analysis showing environmental justice dimensions
    And hyperlocal data strengthens advocacy to broader governance levels

  Scenario: Community board member tracks implementation of traffic safety improvements
    Given city committed to traffic calming measures after neighborhood advocacy
    And board member wants to ensure promises are implemented
    And community members ask whether improvements are actually happening
    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking
    Then they see timeline of committed improvements versus actual installation
    And discover only partial implementation despite full funding
    And access traffic incident data showing ongoing safety concerns
    And find other neighborhoods received promised improvements faster
    And impact tracking holds city accountable to community commitments

  Scenario: Local advisory board member evaluates community facility needs
    Given community center requires major renovations or replacement
    And advisory board must recommend priorities to city council
    And board wants to understand diverse community facility needs
    When the board member seeks community input through Observer
    Then they receive aggregated data on facility usage patterns
    And see survey responses from various community demographic groups
    And access needs assessment comparing current offerings to community priorities
    And discover seniors, youth, and working families have different needs
    And community accountability helps board advocate for inclusive facility design

  Scenario: Neighborhood council member understands displacement pressures in community
    Given neighborhood experiencing rapid housing cost increases
    And longtime residents express concerns about ability to stay
    And council wants to understand scope of displacement threat
    When the council member uses Observer community impact analysis
    Then they receive data on rent increases and eviction rates over time
    And see demographic changes showing displacement patterns
    And access analysis of displacement risk for different household types
    And discover specific buildings and blocks with highest vulnerability
    And hyperlocal data informs advocacy for tenant protections and affordable housing

  Scenario: School site council member advocates for resources from district
    Given school has aging facilities and overcrowded classrooms
    And site council wants district to prioritize school for capital improvements
    And needs to present compelling case competing with other schools
    When the council member uses Observer to prepare advocacy
    Then they receive documentation of facility conditions and capacity issues
    And see comparison to other district schools showing relative needs
    And access student outcome data linking conditions to learning impacts
    And get examples of how district allocated capital funds in past
    And evidence-based advocacy connects community needs to district decisions

  Scenario: Community board member evaluates local business district proposal
    Given neighborhood association considers supporting business district designation
    And designation would create additional fees and services
    And board wants to understand community sentiment and likely impacts
    When the board member requests Observer analysis
    Then they receive survey data from local businesses on designation interest
    And see examples from peer neighborhoods with outcomes and lessons
    And access analysis of which businesses would benefit versus be burdened
    And discover resident concerns about gentrification impacts not mentioned by advocates
    And independent analysis reveals trade-offs beyond promoter presentation

  Scenario: Local board member identifies when community issues require higher-level action
    Given neighborhood board addresses various community concerns
    And some issues are within board authority while others require city or district action
    And board wants to be effective by focusing advocacy appropriately
    When the board member uses Observer governance layer analysis
    Then they see which issues are addressable at community level
    And identify which concerns require municipality or district decisions
    And access guidance on advocacy strategies for different governance levels
    And connect to relevant board members at higher governance layers
    And clear governance mapping makes advocacy more strategic and effective
