Scenario: Developer union relations become transparency issue
    Given a developer has pattern of union-busting and labor resistance
    And claims to support workers while fighting unionization
    When the Observer documents labor relations history
    Then analysis shows: developer spent $400K on union-busting consultants
    And filed NLRB complaints against worker organizing attempts
    And rhetoric about supporting workers contradicts anti-union actions
    And labor relations pattern becomes visible to workers and community
    And developers face accountability for anti-worker practices
