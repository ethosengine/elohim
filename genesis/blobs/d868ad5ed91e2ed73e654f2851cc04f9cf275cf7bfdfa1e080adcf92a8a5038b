Scenario: Grandchild care contributions made visible to family
    Given Margaret provides 15 hours/week of grandchild care
    And this care has market value of approximately $15k/year
    When the family_elohim tracks Margaret's care contributions
    Then the care labor should be quantified and visible
    And her daughter should see specific care contributions
    And the data should show "Margaret provided 60 hours of childcare this month"
    And the economic value should be calculated and displayed
    And Margaret's care work should be recognized, not taken for granted
    And family care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions
    And genuine appreciation should be enabled through visibility
