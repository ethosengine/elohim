Scenario: Communication methods accommodate working single parent schedule
    Given Maria cannot answer phone calls during work hours
    And she manages communications for three children across different schools
    When schools communicate with parents
    Then the educational_elohim should coordinate school communications efficiently
    And schools should use methods accessible to working parents (email, portal, evening calls)
    And Maria should not miss critical information due to daytime-only communication
    And communication should be consolidated and efficient for time-constrained parents
    And schools should respect that single working parents have limited availability
