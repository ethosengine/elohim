Scenario: Coordinating employment search with childcare constraints
    Given I can only work when childcare is available and affordable
    And childcare availability severely limits employment options
    When I search for employment compatible with childcare
    Then the workplace_elohim filters opportunities by schedule and childcare compatibility
    And identifies employers offering childcare support or flexibility
    And helps me calculate whether employment pays enough after childcare costs
    And coordinates employment search with childcare subsidy applications
    And validates that childcare constraints are real barriers, not excuses
    And my personal_agent tracks childcare availability and employment schedule compatibility
    And recognizes that coordinating employment and childcare is complex labor
    And ensures employment genuinely improves rather than worsens my situation
