Scenario: Parent advocates for municipal climate action affecting children
    Given extreme heat days close schools and cancel outdoor activities
    And the parent worries about children's future climate impacts
    When the parent reviews municipal climate adaptation plans
    Then they see schools lack air conditioning for heat waves
    And learn city has no strategy for protecting children's health
    And understand children are most vulnerable to climate impacts
    And connect with other parents concerned about children's futures
    And municipal climate policy centers children's wellbeing and safety
