Scenario: Bioregional belonging includes disabled people as full participants
    Given disabled people are often excluded from community belonging
    And bioregional identity requires full inclusion of all residents
    When bioregional community is defined
    Then the bioregional_elohim should include disabled people as essential members
    And Alex should be welcomed as full bioregional participant
    And disability should be recognized as part of human diversity in ecosystem
    And bioregional care economy should serve disabled members
    And Alex's contributions should be valued within bioregional context
    And the protocol should embody that everyone belongs to place
    And disabled people's relationship to land and ecosystem should be honored
