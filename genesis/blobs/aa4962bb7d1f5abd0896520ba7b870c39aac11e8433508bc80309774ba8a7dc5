Scenario: Environmental commissioner tracks city's climate action plan implementation
    Given city adopted climate action plan with specific reduction targets and timelines
    And annual progress reports from staff emphasize achievements
    And commissioner wants objective assessment of whether city is on track
    When the commissioner uses Observer accountability tracking
    Then they see actual emissions reductions versus plan targets over time
    And discover city is not on track to meet 2030 goals
    And find some action items completed while highest-impact measures delayed
    And access comparison showing peer cities making faster progress
    And accountability tracking reveals gap between plan commitments and implementation
