Scenario: Conducting ethnographic research in Riverside community
    Given I have selected Riverside (population 45,000) for intensive case study
    And I have secured ethical approval and community consent
    When I begin multi-month observation of protocol implementation
    Then I can attend Constitutional Council meetings as observer
    And I can interview appellants like Marcus about their appeal experience
    And I can participate in community deliberations about protocol
    And I can track resource flows and wellbeing indicators
    And I can document challenges and successes as they emerge
    And The community retains ownership of data about themselves
    And My research serves community improvement not just academic publication
