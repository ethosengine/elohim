Scenario: Investor coordinates with municipal climate action through sustainable business investment
    Given municipal climate action requires reducing emissions and building resilience
    And Patricia's investments support sustainable democratic businesses
    When community investment aligns with municipal climate goals
    Then democratic businesses achieve climate targets (local sourcing, renewable energy, waste reduction)
    And community investment supports climate-positive enterprises
    And municipal climate funding can support democratic business conversions
    And climate action and economic democracy align through coordinated investment
    And municipality_elohim coordinates climate-aligned democratic business investment
