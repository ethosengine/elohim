Scenario: Conflict resolution through democratic process, not managerial fiat
    Given DeShawn and another worker have a scheduling disagreement
    And corporate model would have manager impose solution
    When the conflict is brought to worker council
    Then workplace_elohim facilitates mediated discussion
    And both workers express their perspectives and needs
    And council members propose compromise solutions
    And workers reach consensus on fair schedule accommodation
    And conflict is resolved through transparency and democratic process
