Scenario: Insurance navigation and benefits advocacy
    Given disability-related medical costs are substantial
    And insurance systems are complex and often deny coverage
    When Alex navigates insurance systems
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex understand insurance benefits
    And it should track what's covered and what's been denied
    And it should support Alex in appeals processes
    And it should document medical necessity for needed services
    And Alex should have support in fighting insurance denials
    And the protocol should reduce insurance navigation burden
    And Alex should be able to access needed care despite insurance barriers
