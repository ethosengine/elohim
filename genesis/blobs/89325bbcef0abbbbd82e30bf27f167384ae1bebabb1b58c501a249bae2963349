Scenario: Appeal involves national security or existential risk considerations
    Given an agent decision involved claimed national security justification
    And I believe my rights were violated despite security concerns
    When National Constitutional Council reviews the appeal
    Then they evaluate if security claim was legitimate or pretext
    And They examine if security need was balanced with individual dignity
    And They consider if less rights-violating alternatives existed
    And They assess transparency appropriate to security context
    And They create precedent for security-rights balance at national scale
    And My appeal prevents security from becoming excuse for unchecked power
    And Constitutional limits on authority are maintained even under threat
