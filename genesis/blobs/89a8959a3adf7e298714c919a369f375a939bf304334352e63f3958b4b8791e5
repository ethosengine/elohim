Scenario: Farm hosts community events building social connection and food culture
    Given community lacks gathering spaces for celebration and connection
    And food is central to culture and community building
    When democratic farm space is available for community use
    Then harvest festivals celebrate seasonal abundance and agricultural labor
    And farm dinners feature locally-sourced meals with community storytelling
    And cultural food traditions are shared and preserved through farm programming
    And farm becomes community social infrastructure beyond food production
    And community_elohim facilitates community programming and events at farm
