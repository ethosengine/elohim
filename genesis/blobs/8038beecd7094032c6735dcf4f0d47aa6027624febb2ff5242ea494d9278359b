Scenario: Access to healthy food as disability and environmental justice
    Given food systems often fail disabled people and harm environment
    And Alex navigates both food access barriers and ecological concerns
    When food systems are reformed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should connect food justice to disability access
    And sustainable food should be accessible to disabled people
    And Alex should be able to participate in local food systems
    And accessibility should be integrated into food justice work
    And the protocol should recognize food as both disability and ecological issue
    And Alex's perspective should inform food system design
    And local food networks should include disabled people
