Scenario: Tracking self-care achievements despite exhaustion
    Given I am exhausted after double shifts
    And self-care feels impossible
    When I manage to cook a nutritious meal for myself
    Or maintain my living space
    Or get adequate sleep
    Then the protocol should recognize these achievements
    And validate that caring for myself is valuable work
    And celebrate small victories in maintaining well-being
    And build evidence that I deserve conditions that make self-care possible
