Scenario: Teen's work schedule coordinated with other life contexts
    Given Jasmine balances work, school, family responsibilities, and social life
    And her work schedule changes weekly
    When workplace_elohim communicates her schedule
    Then it should coordinate with her personal_agent
    And flag conflicts with school, family needs, or personal commitments
    And help her negotiate schedule that allows balanced life
    And prevent work from overwhelming other essential contexts
    And support her learning to set healthy work boundaries
    And demonstrate that work is one part of life, not life itself
