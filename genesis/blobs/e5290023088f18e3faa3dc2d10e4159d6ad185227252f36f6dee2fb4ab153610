Scenario: Municipal civic engagement increased through care economy participation
    Given Sarah participates actively in municipal care economy
    And civic engagement is strengthened by care work recognition
    When municipal civic participation is measured
    Then care economy participants should show higher engagement
    And Sarah's care work should connect her to civic processes
    And municipal democracy should be strengthened by care economy
    And voter participation should increase among care economy members
    And care creates civic engagement, not just economic value
