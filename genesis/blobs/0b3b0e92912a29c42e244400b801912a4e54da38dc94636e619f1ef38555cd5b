Feature: Community Wealth Reclamation Through Franchise Conversion
  As a franchise_operator in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want franchise locations to transform from extraction sites to community institutions
  So that neighborhood wealth circulates locally instead of extracting to distant corporation

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And James's three ChickenMax franchises were extracting wealth from neighborhoods
    And the community governance context is active
    And conversion enables reclaiming locations as community institutions

  Scenario: Franchise extraction to distant shareholders is replaced by local wealth circulation
    Given franchise locations extracted $120K annually to corporate (fees and markups across three locations)
    And profits beyond operator's modest take also left community
    When conversion eliminates corporate extraction and distributes value locally
    Then $120K annually circulates in neighborhood economies instead of extracting
    And workers earning higher wages spend locally, multiplying community benefit
    And community programs receive funding from value previously extracted
    And wealth circulation is documented showing dramatic shift from extraction to community benefit
    And community_elohim tracks neighborhood economic impact of conversion

  Scenario: Anonymous franchise locations become known community institutions
    Given ChickenMax #247, #248, #249 were corporate outposts without local identity
    And community members saw them as extractive chains, not neighborhood businesses
    When conversion makes locations democratically-governed community institutions
    Then neighborhoods learn their franchise locations chose democratic ownership
    And locations develop distinct community identities (possibly rebranding with local names)
    And community members recognize workers as co-owners, not exploited employees
    And institutions become sources of neighborhood pride instead of corporate extraction symbols
    And community_elohim communicates conversion story building community ownership

  Scenario: Franchise operator's community standing transforms through conversion choice
    Given James was invisible behind ChickenMax brand despite owning locations
    And community saw franchise locations as corporate, didn't know operator existed
    When James's conversion choice becomes visible to neighborhoods
    Then community learns he chose democratic ownership over continuing corporate extraction
    And neighbors respect decision to prioritize workers and community wealth
    And his standing shifts from anonymous franchise operator to community member who chose well
    And conversion demonstrates operators can be allies in community wealth-building
    And community_elohim helps communicate operator's conversion choice and values

  Scenario: Community investment enables conversion while building local ownership stake
    Given conversion requires $750K acquisition capital for three locations
    And community members want to support democratic ownership but lacked pathway
    When community investment pools fund significant portion of acquisition
    Then neighbors invest modest amounts ($2K-$20K each) in conversion
    And investors receive fair return (5% annually) plus social benefit
    And community gains financial stake in democratically-operated local institutions
    And investment connects neighbors to democratic economy building in their community
    And community_elohim manages community investment relationships transparently

  Scenario: Franchise locations become community gathering spaces beyond commercial function
    Given corporate franchise design optimized for transaction speed, not community connection
    And neighborhoods lacked accessible gathering spaces for organizing
    When democratic governance considers community space usage
    Then locations offer meeting space for neighborhood organizing after business hours
    And community bulletin boards share local information and mutual aid opportunities
    And youth employment programs connect young people to food service work with dignity
    And spaces become community hubs serving social needs beyond food service
    And community_elohim facilitates community programming in democratic business spaces

  Scenario: Community accountability ensures democratic locations serve neighborhood needs
    Given franchise corporate ignored community needs in pursuit of profit maximization
    And locations had no mechanism for community input on operations
    When democratic governance includes community stakeholder participation
    Then neighborhood residents can attend stakeholder meetings and provide input
    And community concerns about impacts (environmental, traffic, employment) are heard
    And workers consider community feedback in democratic decision-making
    And accountability flows both ways (community and workers mutually accountable)
    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation protecting worker autonomy

  Scenario: Neighborhood youth gain employment pathways with dignity and ownership potential
    Given franchise locations offered poverty-wage jobs with no advancement or ownership
    And youth employment was exploitative, not developmental
    When democratic governance creates dignified youth employment programs
    Then neighborhood youth earn living wages ($18/hour) with training and support
    And employment includes path to worker ownership for committed participants
    And youth experience democratic governance, not hierarchical exploitation
    And community youth economic opportunity improves dramatically through local democratic businesses
    And community_elohim documents youth employment outcomes and advancement pathways

  Scenario: Local supplier relationships strengthen through franchise purchasing liberation
    Given franchise mandatory purchasing prevented supporting local suppliers
    And community wealth extracted through corporate supply chain
    When purchasing autonomy enables local sourcing decisions
    Then democratic locations source from Johnson Farm and neighborhood suppliers
    And supply chain spending circulates in community, not extracting to national distributors
    And supplier relationships become partnerships benefiting both parties
    And transparent supply chain shows community members how their spending supports local economy
    And community_elohim coordinates local supply relationships for maximum community benefit

  Scenario: Community resilience increases through democratic business network
    Given isolated franchise locations were vulnerable to corporate closure decisions
    And closures destroyed community institutions based on distant profit calculations
    When converted locations join EAE network of mutual support
    Then businesses survive economic downturns through network coordination
    And community institutions are protected from arbitrary corporate closure
    And democratic businesses support each other rather than competing for corporate favor
    And neighborhood economic stability improves through resilient democratic business network
    And community_elohim coordinates network support for community economic resilience

  Scenario: Franchise conversion sparks community organizing and economic democracy awareness
    Given successful conversion demonstrates economic democracy is possible locally
    And community members didn't know democratic alternatives to corporate extraction existed
    When neighborhoods celebrate successful conversion and its benefits
    Then community organizing emerges advocating for more democratic conversions
    And residents learn they can influence local economy through supporting democratic businesses
    And economic democracy becomes part of neighborhood political consciousness
    And conversion inspires broader community action for economic justice
    And community_elohim supports emerging community organizing around economic democracy

  Scenario: Environmental impacts improve through community-accountable governance
    Given franchise corporate externalized environmental costs for profit maximization
    And community bore environmental impacts (waste, pollution, resource depletion)
    When democratic governance includes environmental stewardship accountability
    Then waste reduction and recycling programs are implemented
    And sustainable sourcing (local, organic, regenerative) is prioritized
    And environmental practices are transparent to community
    And community can hold democratic businesses accountable for environmental impacts
    And community_elohim tracks environmental improvements from democratic governance

  Scenario: Community celebrates conversion success as neighborhood economic development
    Given economic development announcements typically celebrate corporate recruitment
    And franchise conversions deserve equal celebration as community wealth-building
    When conversions demonstrate success through measurable community benefits
    Then neighborhood organizations and local media celebrate democratic ownership
    And community events honor workers' ownership and James's conversion choice
    And public celebration builds awareness and political support for democratic economy
    And success story encourages other franchise operators and business owners to consider conversion
    And community_elohim coordinates celebration events amplifying democratic economy visibility
