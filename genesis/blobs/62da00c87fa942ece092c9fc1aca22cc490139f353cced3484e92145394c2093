Scenario: Manager chooses to exit gracefully with dignity and support
    Given Marcus decides democratic coordination isn't the right fit for him
    And corporate would have fired him or demanded resignation
    When he communicates his intention to exit
    Then workers appreciate his honest self-assessment
    And he receives six months severance with glowing reference
    And workplace_elohim facilitates transition support and knowledge transfer
    And he leaves with dignity and community gratitude for attempting transition
    And exit support demonstrates democratic values in practice
