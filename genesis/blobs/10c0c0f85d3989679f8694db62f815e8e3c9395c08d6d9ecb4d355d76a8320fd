Scenario: Advocating for worker-friendly neighborhood policies
    Given neighborhood governance makes decisions affecting workers
    When policies could support workers' care needs and participation
    Then the protocol should help me participate in neighborhood advocacy
    And connect me with other workers for collective voice
    And support advocacy for worker-supportive policies
    And build neighborhood culture that values workers' care needs
