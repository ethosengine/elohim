Scenario: Neighborhood emotional support and parent mental health
    Given parenting is emotionally intense and often isolating
    And Sarah needs connection to parents who understand
    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates parent support
    Then it should enable parent peer support groups
    And it should provide spaces for parents to share struggles
    And emotional support should be recognized as care labor
    And receiving support should not be stigmatized
    And parent mental health should be community priority
    And the system should reduce parenting isolation
