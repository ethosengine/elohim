Scenario: Accessing neighborhood resource sharing networks
    Given neighbors share tools and resources
    And Aisha occasionally needs items she doesn't own
    When Aisha needs to borrow something
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect her to resource sharing
    And it should facilitate tool libraries and sharing arrangements
    And it should track care tokens for borrowing and lending
    And the system should build neighborhood mutual aid
    And resource sharing should reduce individual costs
    And neighborhood cooperation should meet practical needs
