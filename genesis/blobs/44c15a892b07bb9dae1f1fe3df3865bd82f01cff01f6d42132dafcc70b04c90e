Scenario: Recognition of continued contributions despite care receipt
    Given Helen receives substantial care from family and community
    And she also contributes through mentoring and wisdom sharing
    When Helen shares family stories with great-grandchildren
    Then her care contribution should be recognized and valued
    And her personal_agent should note: "Your stories preserve our family history"
    And care tokens should reflect her continued giving
    And the system should make visible that care flows both directions
    And Helen should experience herself as valued person, not burden
    And reciprocity should be visible even when care flows are asymmetric
