Scenario: Sick leave adequate for sole parent who must parent while ill
    Given Maria still parents three children even when sick
    And she has no co-parent to take over when she's unwell
    When Maria needs sick leave
    Then workplace should provide adequate paid sick leave
    And leave should cover both her own illness and children's illnesses
    And sick leave should not be punitive or risk her job security
    And policies should recognize single parents need more sick leave than partnered workers
    And Maria should be able to recover and care for sick children without financial penalty
