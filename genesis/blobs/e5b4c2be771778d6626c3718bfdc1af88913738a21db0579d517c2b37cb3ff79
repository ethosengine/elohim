Scenario: Elderly person's neighborhood contributions made visible
    Given Helen has contributed to neighborhood for decades
    And she still participates in community memory-keeping
    When Helen shares neighborhood history
    Then her contributions should be recognized by neighborhood_elohim
    And neighbors should see that Helen still gives to community
    And her knowledge of neighborhood history should be valued
    And care tokens should reflect her ongoing contributions
    And she should experience herself as valued neighbor, not burden
    And the protocol should make visible that care flows both ways
    And longtime residents should have standing based on accumulated contributions
