Scenario: Journalist collaborates with local reporters on state policy impacts
    Given state budget cuts affect services across all communities
    And the journalist coordinates with local reporters statewide
    When the Observer provides shared state surveillance infrastructure
    Then all journalists access same comprehensive state policy data
    And local reporters show impacts in their specific communities
    And state reporter synthesizes statewide pattern
    And collaborative investigation publishes simultaneously across outlets
    And state policy accountability serves whole state not just capital
