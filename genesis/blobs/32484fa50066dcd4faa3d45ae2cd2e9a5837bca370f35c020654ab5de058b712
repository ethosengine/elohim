Scenario: Home health aide coordination respects household authority
    Given Helen receives visits from home health aides
    And multiple aides may rotate through her schedule
    When aides enter Helen's household
    Then Helen should remain the authority in her space
    And her household_elohim should communicate her preferences to aides
    And aides should be briefed on Helen's routines and wishes
    And consistency should be maintained across different workers
    And Helen should not have to repeatedly assert her preferences
    And care should be provided on her terms in her space
    And the protocol should establish Helen's household sovereignty
