Feature: Municipality Layer Value Recognition for Senior
  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want to access appropriate services and influence municipal policy
  So that municipal systems support senior flourishing and recognize senior contributions

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the senior user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret participates in municipal civic life
    And the municipality governance context is active
    And the municipality_elohim coordinates municipal care economy
    And Margaret lives within the municipal jurisdiction

  Scenario: Access to senior nutrition programs without stigma
    Given Margaret manages nutrition on $32k/year fixed income
    And municipal senior nutrition programs exist
    When the municipality_elohim connects Margaret to food resources
    Then she should be informed about senior meal programs
    And Meals on Wheels or congregate dining should be accessible
    And the framing should be senior service, not poverty relief
    And Margaret should access programs with dignity
    And her care contributions should be visible to counterbalance receiving
    And municipal food resources should support senior health

  Scenario: Municipal senior center programs that recognize continued productivity
    Given Margaret is active and engaged, not waiting to die
    And senior centers sometimes reinforce obsolescence narratives
    When the municipality_elohim connects Margaret to senior programs
    Then programs should treat seniors as productive contributors
    And opportunities should include volunteering, teaching, organizing
    And the focus should be engagement and contribution, not entertainment
    And Margaret should find programs that honor her capability
    And senior centers should be care economy hubs
    And municipal programs should support active aging

  Scenario: Public transportation access supports senior independence
    Given Margaret can no longer afford car ownership
    And she needs transportation for medical appointments, shopping, and social life
    When the municipality_elohim provides transportation information
    Then accessible public transit should be available
    And senior fare programs should be communicated clearly
    And transportation should enable Margaret's continued independence
    And mobility should be supported as key to aging in community
    And municipal transit should be optimized for senior access
    And affordable transportation should preserve autonomy

  Scenario: Municipal food assistance programs accessed with dignity
    Given Margaret's budget is tight at $150/week
    And municipal SNAP or food assistance may be available
    When the municipality_elohim identifies assistance eligibility
    Then Margaret should be informed without stigma
    And enrollment should be simple and dignified
    And her care contributions should be visible alongside receiving benefits
    And the framing should be community resource access
    And participation should feel like claiming entitlement, not begging
    And municipal assistance should support fixed-income seniors

  Scenario: Influencing municipal policy on senior services and care economy
    Given Margaret has lived experience of retirement and care economy
    And municipal policy affects senior quality of life
    When the municipality_elohim facilitates policy engagement
    Then Margaret should be connected to policy-making processes
    And her voice should inform municipal senior services
    And care economy principles should be brought to municipal governance
    And seniors should organize to shape policy
    And Margaret's contributions should give her authority in policy discussions
    And municipal planning should reflect senior input

  Scenario: Municipal health care access and coordination
    Given Margaret has changing health needs with aging
    And she navigates complex health care systems
    When the municipality_elohim coordinates health access
    Then municipal health programs should be accessible
    And senior health clinics should be available and affordable
    And navigation support should help Margaret access care
    And preventive health should be prioritized for seniors
    And municipal health policy should support senior wellness
    And Margaret should be able to age healthily in community

  Scenario: Property tax relief and housing support for fixed-income seniors
    Given Margaret lives on fixed income
    And property taxes or rent can threaten housing stability
    When the municipality_elohim identifies housing assistance
    Then senior property tax relief programs should be communicated
    And rental assistance should be accessible if applicable
    And Margaret should be able to age in place affordably
    And housing stability should be protected for seniors
    And municipal housing policy should recognize fixed-income constraints
    And aging in community should be economically feasible

  Scenario: Senior employment and income supplementation programs
    Given Margaret's fixed income is limited
    And some seniors want/need supplemental income
    When the municipality_elohim provides employment information
    Then senior-appropriate employment opportunities should be available
    And part-time work that doesn't jeopardize benefits should be possible
    And income supplementation programs should be accessible
    And Margaret should have options to increase resources if she chooses
    And employment should be optional, not mandatory for survival
    And municipal programs should support senior economic security

  Scenario: Municipal recognition of senior volunteer contributions
    Given Margaret volunteers extensively in municipal programs
    And her labor subsidizes municipal service provision
    When the municipality_elohim tracks volunteer contributions
    Then municipal government should see aggregate senior volunteer value
    And policy should reflect dependence on senior volunteer labor
    And seniors should be recognized as essential to municipal function
    And Margaret's contributions should give her standing in municipal affairs
    And volunteer labor should inform resource allocation
    And senior productivity should be visible to government

  Scenario: Emergency preparedness includes senior needs and capabilities
    Given Margaret has nursing background and crisis response experience
    And seniors have specific vulnerabilities in emergencies
    When the municipality_elohim coordinates emergency planning
    Then Margaret should be part of emergency response networks
    And her skills should be known to emergency management
    And senior vulnerabilities should be planned for
    And senior capabilities should be mobilized in crisis
    And municipal preparedness should include and empower seniors
    And Margaret should contribute to community resilience

  Scenario: Municipal parks and recreation optimized for senior use
    Given Margaret needs physical activity for health
    And public spaces should serve all ages
    When the municipality_elohim provides recreation information
    Then parks should have senior-appropriate amenities
    And walking paths, benches, and accessibility should be prioritized
    And recreation programs should include senior activities
    And public space should support active aging
    And municipal planning should consider senior needs
    And Margaret should have access to health-supporting public resources

  Scenario: Protecting seniors from municipal surveillance while enabling services
    Given Margaret participates in municipal programs
    And municipal systems collect data
    When the municipality_elohim manages Margaret's municipal data
    Then her privacy must be protected from surveillance
    And service access should not require surrendering privacy
    And data collection should be minimal and purposeful
    And Margaret should control what municipal government knows
    And elder surveillance should be prevented
    And dignity should be preserved in all municipal interactions
