Scenario: Household care tokens include supplements for single-parent resource constraints
    Given Maria's household operates on severely limited income
    And the Value Scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then Maria should receive care token supplements based on income level
    And her single-parent status should qualify for enhanced support
    And supplements should enable continued participation without financial barrier
    And care economy should function as economic support system
    And access should be dignified, never requiring means-tested humiliation
