Scenario: Household privacy protected from external surveillance
    Given household care economy generates detailed family data
    And this data reveals intimate household patterns
    When household data is collected
    Then it must remain under household members' control
    And no external entities should access household data without consent
    And workplace should never see household care patterns
    And community should only see what household chooses to share
    And household privacy should be absolutely protected
