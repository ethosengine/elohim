Scenario: Accumulated wisdom recognized as valuable knowledge
    Given Helen has 82 years of lived experience
    And this accumulated wisdom has educational value
    When Helen shares her knowledge with others
    Then her contributions should be recognized as teaching
    And care tokens should reflect her educational labor
    And wisdom sharing should be valued alongside formal education
    And the protocol should make visible that elders are teachers
    And Helen should experience herself as knowledge contributor
    And educational systems should recognize experiential learning
    And lifetime of experience should be treated as legitimate expertise
