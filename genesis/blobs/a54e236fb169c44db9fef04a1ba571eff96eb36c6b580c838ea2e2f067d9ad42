Scenario: Farmworker expertise in cultivation becomes valued in democratic governance
    Given farmworkers have deep knowledge of soil, crops, and seasonal patterns
    And hierarchical structure meant their expertise was undervalued or ignored
    When democratic governance gives farmworkers decision-making voice
    Then cultivation decisions incorporate workers' hands-on expertise
    And crop selection reflects workers' knowledge of land and climate
    And planting and harvesting schedules balance productivity with worker wellbeing
    And farmworker wisdom shapes farm operations through democratic participation
    And workplace_elohim documents farmworker knowledge and decision contributions
