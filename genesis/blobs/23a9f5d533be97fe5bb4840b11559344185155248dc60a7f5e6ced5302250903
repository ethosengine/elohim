Scenario: Care economy data supports worker advocacy for policy changes
    Given Sarah and colleagues want better workplace care policies
    And employers may not understand workers' care burdens
    When Sarah advocates for workplace policy changes
    Then the workplace_elohim should provide aggregated care economy data
    And advocacy should be strengthened by quantified evidence
    And Sarah should show that care responsibilities are substantial
    And policy discussions should be informed by actual care patterns
    And workers should use care economy data to win policy improvements
