Scenario: Learning local shopping patterns from neighborhood data
    Given Aisha doesn't know the best local stores yet
    And neighborhood residents have collective knowledge
    When Aisha plans shopping trips
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should share aggregated local knowledge
    And it should identify best value stores for different items
    And it should suggest efficient shopping routes
    And it should reflect collective neighborhood wisdom
    And newcomers should benefit from community knowledge
    And local expertise should be shared through the system
