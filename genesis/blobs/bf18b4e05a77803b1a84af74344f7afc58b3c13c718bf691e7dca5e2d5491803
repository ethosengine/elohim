Scenario: Activist shares evidence across borders under repression
    Given an activist documents human rights violations in their country
    And sharing this evidence locally would endanger them and their community
    When they contribute documentation to international human rights network
    And the evidence is verified through multiple independent sources
    Then the evidence reaches international solidarity organizations
    And it bypasses national censorship through distributed architecture
    And the activist's identity is protected through cryptographic anonymity
    And international pressure can be mobilized while protecting sources
    And the network coordinates advocacy at UN and regional bodies
    And documentation is preserved for future accountability processes
