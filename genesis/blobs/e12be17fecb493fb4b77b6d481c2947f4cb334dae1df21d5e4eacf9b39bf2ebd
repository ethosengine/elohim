Scenario: Next generation grows up assuming care economy is normal
    Given Sarah is teaching value literacy to many children
    And children form baseline expectations from early experience
    When children who learn care economy reach adulthood
    Then they should assume care work creates value
    And they should expect care to be visible and recognized
    And they should see care economy as normal, not alternative
    And Sarah's teaching should transform next generation's economic understanding
    And cultural transformation should happen through education
