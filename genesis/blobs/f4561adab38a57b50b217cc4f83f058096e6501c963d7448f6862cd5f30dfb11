Scenario: Testifying to congressional committee on protocol security
    Given Congress considers legislation affecting protocol
    And technical security assessment is needed
    When I testify to legislative committee
    Then I explain: cryptographic foundations and their robustness
    And I assess: attack vectors and defense mechanisms
    And I clarify: what regulation would help vs harm security
    And I present: evidence from adversarial testing
    And I maintain: independence from political pressure
    And I avoid: either advocacy or false neutrality
    And I serve: informed democratic policy making
