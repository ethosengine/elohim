Scenario: Parent coordinates school crossing guard advocacy
    Given the community removed crossing guards at three intersections
    And the parent's child crosses one of these intersections daily
    When the Observer connects parents with children at all three crossings
    Then parents form rapid coalition with documented safety data
    And coordinate to attend the community safety meeting together
    And present unified testimony about near-miss incidents
    And individual parent concerns become undeniable pattern
    And crossing guards are restored within two weeks
