Scenario: Local food systems knowledge from pre-industrial era
    Given Helen remembers more localized food systems
    And she knows seasonal availability and regional food traditions
    When Helen contributes to local food system planning
    Then her knowledge should inform food sovereignty efforts
    And bioregional food systems should learn from her memory
    And traditional food preservation should be taught by those who practiced it
    And Helen should be recognized as expert in local food culture
    And the protocol should preserve pre-globalization food knowledge
    And sustainable food systems should incorporate elder wisdom
    And Helen's knowledge should reduce dependence on industrial food systems
