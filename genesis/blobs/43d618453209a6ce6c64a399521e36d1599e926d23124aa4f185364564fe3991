Scenario: Investor advocates for municipal community investment tax incentives
    Given municipality offers tax breaks for corporate investment
    And community investment lacks equivalent policy support
    When Patricia and other investors organize for policy change
    Then they advocate to city council for community investment tax credits
    And propose municipal matching funds for community investment pools
    And credible advocacy comes from investors who've proven model viability
    And municipal policy evolves to support community investment and democratic ownership
    And municipality_elohim coordinates investor advocacy and policy development
