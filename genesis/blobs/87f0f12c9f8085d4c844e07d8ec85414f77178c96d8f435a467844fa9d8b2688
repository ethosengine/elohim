Scenario: Nature education and outdoor learning experiences
    Given Margaret takes grandchildren on nature walks and outdoor activities
    And they learn about plants, animals, seasons, and environment
    When the educational_elohim tracks outdoor learning
    Then it should recognize nature education as valuable teaching
    And it should value outdoor experiences as developmental care
    And it should track environmental learning and wonder cultivation
    And nature education should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's outdoor teaching should be recognized and supported
    And experiential learning should complement classroom education
