**Instructions:** For Individual Christians:

Personal Lifestyle Audit: Develop a tool for individuals to assess how their daily choices (consumption, housing, transportation, etc.) impact their attention, intentionality, and the quality of their experiences.  
"Sacred Attention" Challenge: Create a 30-day program that guides individuals to reclaim their attention through practices like digital fasting, contemplative prayer, and mindful technology use.  
Digital Footprint Evaluation: Provide a framework for Christians to critically evaluate their online behavior and digital consumption habits in light of their faith values.  
Ethical Stewardship Course: Develop a course on managing personal finances and resources in ways that prioritize deeply valuable experiences over consumerism.  
Community Impact Assessment: Guide individuals in mapping their sphere of influence and identifying opportunities to foster intentional, meaningful relationships in their neighborhoods and workplaces.

For Church Leaders and Developers:  
Holistic Church Audit: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of church activities, assessing how they align with the principles of protecting attention, fostering intentionality, and creating deeply valuable experiences.  
Redefining Success Metrics: Move away from attendance and giving as primary success indicators. Develop new metrics that measure growth in community relationships, spiritual formation, and local community impact.  
Intentional Gathering Design: Reimagine church gatherings to prioritize deep, meaningful interactions over passive consumption of religious content.  
Digital Discipleship Framework: Create guidelines for using digital tools to enhance, not replace, face-to-face discipleship and community building.  
"Less is More" Ministry Model: Develop a church model that emphasizes quality of engagement over quantity of programs, allowing more time and space for reflection and intentional living.  
Neighborhood Engagement Strategy: Design initiatives that embed the church deeply in local community life, fostering relationships and addressing real needs.  
Intergenerational Wisdom Exchange: Create programs that facilitate the sharing of life experiences and spiritual insights across generations.  
Collective Resource Stewardship: Implement systems for shared resources within the church community (e.g., tool libraries, carpooling networks, skill exchanges) to promote simplicity and interdependence.  
Digital Commons Development: Build a church-specific digital platform that facilitates community coordination, resource sharing, and collective decision-making while respecting attention and fostering intentionality.  
"Slow Church" Movement: Promote a church culture that values depth over speed, quality over quantity, and process over immediate results.

Priorities for Implementation:  
Education and Awareness: Prioritize helping individuals and churches understand the impact of technology on attention, intentionality, and the quality of our experiences.  
Embodied Practices: Focus on developing habits and rituals that bring abstract principles into concrete, lived experience.  
Systemic Thinking: Encourage a shift from individual-focused solutions to community-wide transformations.  
Relationship-Centric Design: Ensure all technological implementations prioritize the strengthening of real-world relationships.  
Simplicity and Depth: Promote a "less but better" approach in both personal life and church programming.  
Local Rootedness: Emphasize the church's role in local community flourishing.  
Intergenerational Integration: Actively work against age segregation in church life and decision-making.  
Continuous Reflection: Implement regular assessment and reflection practices to ensure ongoing alignment with core principles.  
Counter-Cultural Witness: Empower the church to model alternative ways of living that prioritize attention, intentionality, and deeply valuable experiences in a distracted world.

These applications and priorities aim to create a church culture that embodies the principles of protecting attention, fostering intentionality, and creating deeply valuable experiences. They challenge both individuals and churches to critically examine their relationship with technology and to develop practices that support genuine human flourishing in light of Christian values.
