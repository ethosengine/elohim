Scenario: Learning that contributes to community knowledge without exploitation
    Given Tommy's learning patterns generate educational data
    And this data could improve pedagogy for other children
    When Tommy's anonymized learning data is collected
    Then it must only be used to improve educational outcomes
    And Tommy's privacy must be absolutely protected
    And no commercial exploitation of learning data should occur
    And data should serve collective learning, not surveillance capitalism
    And Tommy's education must never be monetized
