Scenario: Environmental toxins and disability intersection
    Given environmental pollution causes and exacerbates disabilities
    And disabled people are particularly vulnerable to environmental toxins
    When environmental health is addressed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize disability-environment connections
    And it should track how environmental factors affect disabled people
    And Alex's experience should inform environmental health advocacy
    And environmental justice should include preventing disability from toxins
    And the protocol should connect environmental and disability health
    And Alex's advocacy should strengthen environmental health protections
    And prevention of environmentally-caused disability should be prioritized
