Scenario: Construction knowledge applied to home energy efficiency improvements
    Given Frank has expertise in building systems and repairs
    And home energy efficiency reduces environmental impact and costs
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates weatherization and efficiency
    Then it should connect Frank's skills to home efficiency improvements
    And facilitate community weatherization projects
    And recognize efficiency work as ecological care contribution
    And help low-income households reduce energy costs and consumption
    And Frank's construction knowledge should serve ecological and equity goals
    And his volunteer work should build community energy resilience
