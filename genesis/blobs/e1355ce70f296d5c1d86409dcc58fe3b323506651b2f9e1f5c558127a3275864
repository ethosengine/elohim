Scenario: Studying marginalized community access and outcomes
    Given I hypothesize protocol might help or harm marginalized communities
    And I need to rigorously test distributional effects
    When I analyze outcomes by race, class, disability, immigration status
    Then I examine: whether marginalized communities adopt at equal rates
    And I assess: whether they face barriers to effective participation
    And I measure: whether Constitutional Council service includes them proportionally
    And I analyze: whether appeal outcomes differ by demographic group
    And I investigate: whether protocol reduces or exacerbates inequality
    And I provide: evidence about who benefits and who suffers from protocol
    And My research serves: justice by making invisible inequities visible
