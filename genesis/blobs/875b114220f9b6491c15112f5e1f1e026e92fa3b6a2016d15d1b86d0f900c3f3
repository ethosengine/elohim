    Then she learns tomatoes come from Johnson Farm where Tom practices regenerative agriculture
    And she can visit farm during open houses if interested
    And farmworker conditions and wages are transparent
    And food becomes connected to human labor and environmental stewardship, not faceless commodity
    And community_elohim provides supply chain stories and farm connections
