Scenario: Activist connects local impacts to state policy
    Given state education funding formula harms the activist's district
    And needs to build pressure for reform
    When the Observer calculates local impacts of state policy
    Then the activist shows how formula shortchanges their district by $4M
    And documents impacts on class sizes and programs
    And connects families affected by funding gaps
    And state policy debate becomes grounded in local reality
    And abstract policy becomes personal stakes
