Scenario: Continued learning and growth acknowledged at advanced age
    Given Helen participates in senior learning programs
    And she shares ecological wisdom from decades of experience
    When Helen engages with educational content
    Then the system should recognize that learning continues until death
    And her accumulated knowledge should be valued
    And opportunities to share wisdom should be surfaced
    And she should experience ongoing growth and contribution
    And the protocol should reject notion that personhood ends with productivity decline
    And Helen should be supported in remaining engaged with life
