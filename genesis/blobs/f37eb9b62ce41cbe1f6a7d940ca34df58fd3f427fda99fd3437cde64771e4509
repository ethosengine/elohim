Scenario: Garden and food production as ecological care and education
    Given Sarah wants children to understand food systems
    And growing food teaches ecological relationships
    When Sarah gardens with Tommy and Emma
    Then the ecological_elohim should recognize gardening as multi-dimensional care
    And it should value food production, education, and ecological benefit
    And teaching children to grow food should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should recognize food sovereignty work
    And Sarah's effort to build children's food system understanding should be valued
    And gardening should be recognized as ecological care labor
