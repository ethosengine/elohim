Scenario: Deliberating multi-community coordination case
    Given an appeal involves agent decisions across several communities
    And different communities have conflicting local calibrations
    When our regional council reviews the inter-community conflict
    Then we evaluate: how subsidiarity applies across boundaries
    And we examine: if regional coordination is constitutionally required
    And we consider: if local diversity should be harmonized or preserved
    And we consult: community leaders about local context
    And we establish: regional minimums while respecting variation
    And we create: precedent for multi-layer governance coherence
    And our judgment: enables communities to coordinate democratically
