Scenario: Parent's care work visible across extended family
    Given Sarah provides care to her children and aging parents
    And she coordinates between generations
    When the family_elohim tracks Sarah's care contributions
    Then her work should be visible to entire extended family
    And grandparents should see Sarah's parenting labor
    And siblings should see her coordination work
    And the full family should recognize her care contributions
    And visibility should enable family-wide appreciation
    And Sarah's labor should be valued across all family relationships
