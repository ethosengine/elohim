Scenario: Seasonal eating patterns support bioregional food systems
    Given Margaret shops for seasonal produce
    And seasonal eating reduces food miles and supports local agriculture
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food choices
    Then seasonal eating patterns should be recognized
    And Margaret's choices should support bioregional food systems
    And local, seasonal food should be prioritized in recommendations
    And eating with seasons should be encouraged and facilitated
    And bioregional awareness should develop through practice
    And Margaret's food choices should strengthen local food economy
