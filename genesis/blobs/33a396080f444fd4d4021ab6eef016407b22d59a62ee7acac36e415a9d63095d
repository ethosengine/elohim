Scenario: Extended family contributions distributed equitably
    Given James carries enormous family care burden
    And other family members could provide some support
    When the family_elohim analyzes family care distribution
    Then it should identify who is doing what
    And it should make visible that James is carrying most burden
    And it should prevent care from falling entirely on one person
    And it should enable equitable distribution negotiations
    And family care should be shared fairly, not concentrated
