Scenario: Household care tokens reflect combined family contributions
    Given household participates in care token economy
    And both adults and children contribute care labor
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then tokens should accumulate from all members' contributions
    And Sarah's care work should be valued appropriately
    And partner's contributions should be recognized
    And children's age-appropriate care work should count
    And household should receive care token supplements for income level
    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status
