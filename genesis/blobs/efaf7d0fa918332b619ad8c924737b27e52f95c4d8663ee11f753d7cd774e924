Scenario: Teaching traditional skills and practices to younger generations
    Given Helen knows traditional household management, cooking, and crafts
    And younger generations often lack these practical skills
    When Helen teaches traditional knowledge
    Then her expertise should be recognized and valued
    And teaching opportunities should be coordinated
    And her knowledge should be preserved through transmission
    And care tokens should reflect her educational contributions
    And the protocol should facilitate skills transfer from elders
    And traditional knowledge should be valued in educational systems
    And Helen should experience being needed for what she knows
