Scenario: Coordinating family information sharing to protect privacy and safety
    Given different family members have different levels of trustworthiness
    And information about my location or situation could compromise safety
    When I decide what to share with which family members
    Then the family_elohim helps me track what information each person has
    And provides graduated privacy controls for different relationships
    And alerts me if information sharing could create safety risks
    And helps me maintain consistent boundaries about what I disclose
    And supports me withholding information from untrustworthy family
    And my personal_agent reminds me of safety protocols
    And recognizes information management as constant cognitive labor
    And validates that privacy protection is appropriate
