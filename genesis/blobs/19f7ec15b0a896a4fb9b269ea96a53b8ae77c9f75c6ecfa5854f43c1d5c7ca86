Scenario: Documenting dissenting opinion preserving minority view
    Given our council reaches majority decision on appeal
    And I disagree with the majority interpretation
    When we document the precedent
    Then my dissenting opinion: is included with full reasoning
    And I explain: alternative constitutional reading
    And I articulate: why majority may have missed important considerations
    And future councils: can reference both majority and dissent
    And constitutional evolution: can draw on minority wisdom later
    And my disagreement: is honored as legitimate democratic deliberation
    And precedent reflects: richness of constitutional debate
