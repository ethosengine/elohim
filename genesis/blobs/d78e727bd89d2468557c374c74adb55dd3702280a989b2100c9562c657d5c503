Scenario: Providing congressional testimony on protocol effectiveness
    Given Congress is considering national AI governance legislation
    And Senator Ruiz invites me to testify as independent expert
    When I present research findings to legislative committee
    Then I summarize: rigorous evaluation of protocol outcomes
    And I present: evidence about effectiveness, limitations, and unknowns
    And I explain: what factors predict success and failure
    And I testify: honestly about uncertainties and contested findings
    And I respond: to questions from supportive and skeptical legislators
    And I maintain: scientific independence over political pressure
    And My testimony provides: evidence base for democratic policy choice
