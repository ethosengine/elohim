Scenario: Recognition of invisible care labor by 5-year-old
    Given Tommy has chosen strawberries for his sister Emma
    And the care contribution has been recorded
    When the transaction is complete
    Then Tommy's care work should be made visible to the family
    And his personal_agent should provide warm recognition
    And the agent should say "You helped. Your care matters. You made Emma happy."
    And the recognition should feel like love, not data extraction
    And care tokens should be allocated to reflect his contribution
    And no transactional language should be used
