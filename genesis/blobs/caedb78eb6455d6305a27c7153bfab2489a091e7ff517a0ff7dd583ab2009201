Scenario: Coordinating Margaret's mother's care among siblings
    Given Margaret has siblings who also have responsibilities to their mother
    And Margaret currently does most hands-on care
    When the family_elohim coordinates elder care among siblings
    Then all siblings' contributions should be visible
    And disparities in care burden should be evident
    And fair distribution conversations should be supported by data
    And Margaret should not bear disproportionate burden invisibly
    And sibling care economy should operate on transparency
    And family equity should be maintained across distance and circumstance
