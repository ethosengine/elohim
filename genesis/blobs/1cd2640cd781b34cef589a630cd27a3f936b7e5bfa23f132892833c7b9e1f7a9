Scenario: Responsible developer benefits from positive labor reputation
    Given a responsible developer treats workers well consistently
    And has track record of fair wages, safe conditions, and respect
    When the Observer makes labor reputation visible
    Then the developer shows: zero labor violations across 12 projects
    And worker testimonials describe positive treatment and fair practices
    And unions support developer's projects because of good labor relations
    And positive labor reputation creates advantages in competitive approvals
    And responsible employment practices strengthen business success
