Scenario: Contributing to global public discourse on AI governance
    Given public understanding shapes political will for democratic AI
    And I have findings that matter for global deliberation
    When I engage in global public education and discourse
    Then I write: accessible articles for general audiences
    And I give: public lectures explaining research findings
    And I participate: in media discussions with honesty about uncertainties
    And I contribute: to democratic deliberation about governance alternatives
    And I explain: what's at stake, what options exist, what evidence shows
    And I avoid: false certainty or ideological advocacy
    And My public engagement serves: informed democratic choice about AI governance
