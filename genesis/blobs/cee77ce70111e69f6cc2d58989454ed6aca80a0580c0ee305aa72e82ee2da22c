Scenario: Parent participates without attending evening meetings
    Given the parent has evening work shifts and bedtime routines
    And cannot attend 7 PM community meetings in person
    When decisions about afterschool programs are being made
    Then the parent reviews 5-minute summaries during lunch break
    And submits questions and positions via mobile app
    And receives alerts if live intervention would be high-impact
    And gets post-meeting summary with next action steps
    And democracy respects that raising children is the priority job
