Feature: Healthcare Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver
  As a caregiver navigating complex medical systems
  Operating at the healthcare/medical governance layer
  I want medical system navigation support and caregiver-as-partner recognition
  So that care recipients receive appropriate care and caregivers are supported as essential care team members

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the caregiver user "James" is registered in the system
    And James cares for David (52) with early-onset Alzheimer's
    And David sees neurologist, primary care physician, and various specialists
    And James coordinates all medical care and makes medical decisions
    And the healthcare governance context is active
    And the healthcare_elohim assists with medical system navigation
    And James interfaces constantly with complex medical systems

  Scenario: Caregiver recognized as essential member of care team
    Given James attends all medical appointments with David
    And James knows David's condition better than providers seeing him occasionally
    When medical providers interact with James and David
    Then the healthcare_elohim should ensure James is recognized as care team member
    And providers should treat James as expert on David's daily reality
    And James's observations should be valued in medical decisions
    And caregiver knowledge should be integrated into medical care
    And healthcare system should partner with caregivers, not exclude them

  Scenario: Medication management supported across multiple providers
    Given David takes multiple medications from different specialists
    And medication interactions could be dangerous
    When the healthcare_elohim tracks David's medications
    Then it should maintain comprehensive medication list
    And it should identify potential interactions across providers
    And it should alert James to medication concerns
    And medication timing and administration should be tracked
    And medical complexity should be managed systematically

  Scenario: Medical appointment coordination across multiple specialists
    Given David requires regular appointments with multiple providers
    And James must coordinate complex scheduling
    When the healthcare_elohim manages appointments
    Then it should maintain integrated calendar across providers
    And it should remind James of upcoming appointments
    And it should coordinate transportation and timing
    And it should prepare James with information needed for each visit
    And medical coordination burden should be reduced through system support

  Scenario: Medical record integration for comprehensive care coordination
    Given David's medical information is scattered across providers
    And comprehensive view is essential for good care
    When the healthcare_elohim accesses medical records
    Then it should integrate information across healthcare systems
    And James should have complete medical picture
    And providers should receive comprehensive information
    And medical record fragmentation should be addressed
    And care coordination should be supported by integrated data

  Scenario: Caregiver advocacy when medical system fails patient
    Given medical systems sometimes fail patients with complex needs
    And James must advocate for David's appropriate care
    When the healthcare_elohim detects inadequate care
    Then it should alert James to system failures
    And it should provide information for advocacy
    And it should help James escalate concerns effectively
    And caregiver should be empowered to demand appropriate care
    And healthcare system should be accountable to patient and caregiver

  Scenario: Symptom tracking supports accurate reporting to providers
    Given David's Alzheimer's symptoms fluctuate and progress
    And accurate symptom reporting is essential for care
    When the healthcare_elohim tracks symptoms
    Then it should maintain detailed symptom logs
    And it should identify patterns and changes over time
    And it should prepare symptom summaries for appointments
    And provider understanding should be improved by detailed tracking
    And caregiver observation should enhance medical accuracy

  Scenario: Insurance navigation support reduces administrative burden
    Given medical insurance is byzantine and frustrating
    And James must manage claims, authorizations, coverage
    When the healthcare_elohim assists with insurance
    Then it should help James navigate insurance processes
    And it should track claims and identify problems
    And it should assist with authorization requirements
    And it should escalate coverage denials for appeal
    And insurance complexity should not prevent needed care

  Scenario: Respite care prescribed as medical necessity
    Given caregiver burnout threatens James's ability to provide care
    And respite is essential for sustainable caregiving
    When the healthcare_elohim advocates for respite
    Then respite care should be prescribed as medical necessity
    And insurance should cover respite like other medical care
    And providers should understand caregiver burnout is medical concern
    And James's health should be recognized as essential care infrastructure
    And healthcare system should support caregiver sustainability

  Scenario: Advanced care planning supported early and comprehensively
    Given David's condition is progressive and will worsen
    And advance directives are essential before capability is lost
    When the healthcare_elohim facilitates care planning
    Then it should prompt advance directive discussions early
    And it should help James and David document wishes
    And it should ensure legal documents are comprehensive
    And it should coordinate care planning across providers
    And future care should be planned while David can still participate

  Scenario: Caregiver health monitoring as part of care recipient's care plan
    Given James's health directly affects his ability to care for David
    And caregiver health collapse creates patient crisis
    When the healthcare_elohim monitors caregiver health
    Then James's health should be tracked as part of care plan
    And providers should ask about caregiver well-being
    And caregiver health problems should trigger intervention
    And James should be required to attend his own medical appointments
    And healthcare system should recognize caregiver health as patient health infrastructure

  Scenario: Crisis intervention planning for medical emergencies
    Given David's condition could deteriorate suddenly
    And medical crises require rapid coordinated response
    When the healthcare_elohim prepares for crisis
    Then it should maintain emergency care plan
    And it should ensure all providers have emergency contacts
    And it should coordinate with emergency services
    And it should prepare James for likely crisis scenarios
    And medical emergencies should have planned responses

  Scenario: Palliative care integration as disease progresses
    Given Alzheimer's is progressive and eventually terminal
    And palliative care improves quality of life before end stage
    When the healthcare_elohim considers palliative care
    Then it should introduce palliative care discussions early
    And it should coordinate palliative services with disease management
    And it should ensure David's comfort and dignity are prioritized
    And James should have support for progressive care needs
    And healthcare should include palliative approach throughout disease

  Scenario: Medical provider education about caregiver as care partner
    Given some providers dismiss or ignore family caregivers
    And this undermines care quality and caregiver well-being
    When the healthcare_elohim advocates for caregiver role
    Then it should educate providers about caregiver expertise
    And it should demonstrate caregivers improve care outcomes
    And it should advocate for caregiver partnership in care teams
    And providers should be trained to work with family caregivers
    And healthcare culture should recognize caregivers as essential partners
