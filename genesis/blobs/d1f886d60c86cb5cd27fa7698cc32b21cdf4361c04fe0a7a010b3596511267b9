Scenario: Longitudinal study of Constitutional Council member development
    Given I am tracking council members like Sarah over time
    And I want to understand how service affects them
    When I study council members before, during, and after service
    Then I measure: constitutional literacy development
    And I assess: deliberative skill acquisition
    And I examine: civic confidence and participation changes
    And I track: whether capabilities persist after service ends
    And I explore: whether service affects children's civic development
    And I analyze: whether sortition creates democratic capacity at population scale
    And My research tests: whether citizen governance transforms citizens
