Scenario: Community mutual aid network provides support during crisis
    Given Sarah or community members may face crises
    And traditional systems often fail to provide adequate support
    When Sarah experiences job loss, health emergency, or family crisis
    Then the community_elohim should connect her to mutual aid network
    And support should be immediate, dignified, and effective
    And community should function as safety net
    And Sarah's previous contributions should enable access to help
    And mutual aid should be reciprocal and community-based
