Scenario: Workers address problematic customer behavior democratically
    Given a customer has harassed DeShawn multiple times
    And worker safety is constitutionally protected
    When workers document harassment incidents through witness infrastructure
    Then workers review harassment pattern democratically
    And workers vote to ban the customer from ChickenMax
    And community_elohim ensures decision is fair and documented
    And community respects worker dignity protections
    And customer harassment ceases without manager intervention
