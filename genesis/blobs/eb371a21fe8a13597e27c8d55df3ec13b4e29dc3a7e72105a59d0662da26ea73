Scenario: Producing comprehensive written opinion for landmark case
    Given our case has major national implications
    And it will be studied for generations
    When we craft our written opinion
    Then we explain: constitutional reasoning in accessible language
    And we address: major arguments and counterarguments
    And we examine: long-term implications of our interpretation
    And we include: dissenting opinions with their reasoning
    And we document: our deliberation process and considerations
    And we create: precedent that serves legal clarity and public education
    And we demonstrate: how citizen governance produces constitutional law
    And we fulfill: responsibility to those affected by our judgment
