Scenario: Contributing care tokens to community initiatives
    Given I accumulate care tokens through my work and participation
    And community initiatives need resource pooling
    When I want to support community projects or people in need
    Then the protocol should enable me to contribute care tokens
    And facilitate care economy resource distribution
    And recognize that even workers with limited money can contribute meaningfully
    And build community care economy beyond cash transactions
