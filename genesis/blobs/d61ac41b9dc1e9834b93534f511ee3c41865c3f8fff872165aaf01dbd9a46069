Feature: Democratic Food System Supply Chain Transformation
  As a supplier in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the industry_sector governance layer
  I want to participate in democratizing entire food supply chain
  So that extraction is replaced by fair value distribution from farm to table

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Johnson Farm supplies EAE democratic food service network
    And the industry_sector governance context is active
    And food system transformation requires supply chain coordination

  Scenario: Direct farmer-to-restaurant relationships replace corporate distributor extraction
    Given corporate distributors (Sysco, US Foods) extract 400-500% markup between farmer and restaurant
    And Tom received $0.50/lb for tomatoes distributors sold for $2.50/lb
    When EAE network enables direct relationships
    Then Tom receives $1.50/lb for tomatoes (3x previous payment)
    And restaurants pay $2.00/lb (20% less than through distributor)
    And both parties benefit massively by eliminating extractive middleman
    And corporate distributor extraction is replaced by transparent partnership
    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates direct supply relationships across network

  Scenario: Democratic supply chain coordination provides volume purchasing power
    Given individual farms and restaurants lack negotiating leverage with suppliers
    And corporate chains use volume to extract favorable pricing
    When democratic network coordinates purchasing across multiple entities
    Then farmers coordinate to provide consistent supply achieving volume benefits
    And restaurants coordinate orders achieving volume purchasing power
    And democratic coordination provides efficiency without extraction
    And small democratic entities match corporate scale through cooperation
    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates coordinated purchasing and supply planning

  Scenario: Seasonal supply coordination enables year-round democratic food service
    Given individual farms have limited seasonal production windows
    And restaurants need year-round supply but faced corporate distribution dependence
    When democratic farms coordinate across climate zones and seasons
    Then network provides diverse year-round supply through farmer coordination
    And restaurants adapt menus to seasonal availability reducing waste
    And farmers specialize in crops suited to their land and climate
    And seasonal coordination provides reliability without standardization
    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates seasonal supply across bioregional network

  Scenario: Supply chain transparency from farm to table builds trust and accountability
    Given corporate food system is opaque making accountability impossible
    And customers and workers don't know where food comes from or how people were treated
    When democratic supply chain implements radical transparency
    Then customers trace food from specific farm (Johnson Farm tomatoes) to their plate
    And farming practices (organic, regenerative) are documented and visible
    And farmworker wages and conditions are transparent
    And value distribution is clear showing fair compensation throughout chain
    And industry_sector_elohim provides supply chain transparency platform

  Scenario: Democratic food system challenges corporate distributor business model
    Given corporate distributors depend on opacity and extraction for profit
    And their value proposition (convenience, consistency) doesn't justify 400% markup
    When democratic network demonstrates distribution without extraction
    Then corporate distributors face competitive threat from transparent alternative
    And necessary distribution functions (logistics, aggregation) are provided at cost-recovery pricing
    And extractive markup is proven unnecessary for functioning supply chain
    And food industry learns distribution can be democratic cooperative, not profit-maximizing corporation
    And industry_sector_elohim documents cost comparison between extractive and democratic distribution

  Scenario: Farmer cooperation replaces competition through democratic coordination
    Given farmers traditionally compete for corporate contracts driving prices down
    And competition prevented coordination benefiting all farmers
    When democratic network enables farmer cooperation
    Then Tom and neighboring farms coordinate complementary production
    And crop specialization (one farm tomatoes, another greens, another roots) provides diversity
    And revenue is shared fairly based on contribution
    And farmers share equipment, labor, and expertise
    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates farmer network coordination and fair value distribution

  Scenario: Sustainable agriculture becomes economically viable through fair pricing
    Given corporate food system makes sustainable farming nearly impossible financially
    And Tom wanted to practice regenerative agriculture but margins were too thin
    When democratic network pays premium for sustainable practices
    Then organic and regenerative farming become profitable, not costly burden
    And environmental stewardship is valued through higher prices, not punished through market
    And sustainable practices spread as economic viability is proven
    And food system transformation includes ecological regeneration
    And industry_sector_elohim tracks sustainability premium impacts on farming practices

  Scenario: Food service workers and farmworkers build solidarity across supply chain
    Given workers in restaurants and farms were isolated from each other
    And corporate structure prevented relationship building across supply chain
    When democratic network connects food workers and farmworkers
    Then Emma (restaurant worker) and Tom's farmworkers coordinate directly
    And workers across supply chain recognize shared interests and values
    And solidarity builds between urban food service and rural agriculture
    And cross-training opportunities enable workers to learn full food system
    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates worker connections across supply chain

  Scenario: Democratic distribution cooperative emerges providing logistics without extraction
    Given some distribution infrastructure is useful (aggregation, transportation, storage)
    And corporate distributors provide this but extract massively beyond cost
    When democratic network creates worker-owned distribution cooperative
    Then logistics services are provided at cost-recovery, not profit maximization
    And distribution workers gain ownership and democratic governance
    And necessary functions are preserved without extraction
    And democratic cooperative proves distribution infrastructure can be democratically operated
    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates democratic distribution cooperative development

  Scenario: Quality standards improve through democratic supply chain accountability
    Given corporate food system often degrades quality for profit maximization
    And quality claims are marketing, not enforceable accountability
    When democratic supply chain implements transparent quality documentation
    Then farming practices are witnessed and documented (soil health, pest management, harvest quality)
    And restaurant food preparation is transparent to customers
    And quality accountability flows throughout chain
    And standards continuously improve through democratic feedback and learning
    And industry_sector_elohim manages quality documentation and accountability systems

  Scenario: Food system workforce development includes democratic governance training
    Given food service and agriculture training focuses on technical skills only
    And democratic enterprises need workers skilled in collaboration and governance
    When industry sector develops democratic food system training programs
    Then workers learn technical skills (cooking, cultivation) plus democratic governance
    And training includes cooperative business, facilitation, and consensus decision-making
    And educational institutions incorporate democratic food system curriculum
    And workforce is prepared for democratic enterprise participation
    And industry_sector_elohim develops training curriculum and coordinates educational partnerships

  Scenario: Democratic food system becomes recognized industry sector alternative
    Given food industry is dominated by corporate extraction model
    And alternative models are marginalized as niche or idealistic
    When democratic food network reaches scale and proves viability
    Then "democratic food system" becomes recognized industry category
    And industry conferences, publications, and research treat it as serious alternative
    And investment flows toward democratic food enterprises
    And policy makers design regulations supporting democratic food system
    And industry_sector_elohim advocates for democratic food system recognition and support
