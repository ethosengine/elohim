# Activist - Social Medium

## Archetype

An activist is a person engaged in organized efforts for social, political, environmental, or cultural change. In the Social Medium context, activists range from grassroots community organizers to international movement coordinators. They work across multiple governance layers to build solidarity, coordinate action, share evidence-based information, and create sustainable change while protecting themselves and their communities from suppression.

- Coordinates with diverse communities and movements
