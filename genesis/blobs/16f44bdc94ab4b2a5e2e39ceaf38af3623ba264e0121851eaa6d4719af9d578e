Scenario: Board member tracks accountability for student outcome commitments
    Given the politician pledged to improve reading proficiency
    And committed to closing achievement gaps
    When the Observer monitors outcome tracking
    Then they see reading proficiency trends by school and demographic
    And identify which interventions work versus ineffective programs
    And receive alerts when metrics decline
    And understand whether district implements promised reforms
    And maintain accountability for student outcome commitments
