Scenario: Refugee protected from human trafficking scheme
    Given Amira is seeking employment in Germany
    When traffickers posing as employers try to contact her
    And they offer suspiciously lucrative jobs requiring isolation
    Then the protection agent identifies trafficking patterns
    And the fraudulent messages never reach Amira
    And she is protected without knowing she was targeted
    And legitimate employment resources continue to reach her
    And vulnerable refugees are protected from exploitation
