Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person
  As a retired person in the value scanner system
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want my construction knowledge applied to sustainable building and resource conservation valued
  So that retirement enables ecological stewardship and my skills serve bioregional flourishing

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the retired user "Frank" is registered in the system
    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction
    And Frank volunteers with Habitat for Humanity
    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active
    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates ecological care practices
    And Frank's construction knowledge can serve sustainable building

  Scenario: Sustainable building practices in Habitat construction work
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week in construction
    And building practices have significant environmental impact
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks Frank's construction work
    Then it should recognize opportunities for sustainable building techniques
    And suggest energy-efficient construction methods
    And facilitate use of recycled or sustainable materials
    And help Frank apply his skills to ecological building
    And quantify environmental benefit of sustainable construction choices
    And recognize that his labor can serve both housing and ecological goals
    And Habitat work should model sustainable building practices

  Scenario: Construction knowledge applied to home energy efficiency improvements
    Given Frank has expertise in building systems and repairs
    And home energy efficiency reduces environmental impact and costs
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates weatherization and efficiency
    Then it should connect Frank's skills to home efficiency improvements
    And facilitate community weatherization projects
    And recognize efficiency work as ecological care contribution
    And help low-income households reduce energy costs and consumption
    And Frank's construction knowledge should serve ecological and equity goals
    And his volunteer work should build community energy resilience

  Scenario: Teaching repair and maintenance reduces waste and consumption
    Given Frank knows how to repair buildings, equipment, and systems
    And repair culture counters disposability and resource extraction
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates repair knowledge sharing
    Then it should facilitate Frank teaching repair skills
    And help community members learn to maintain their homes
    And recognize repair education as ecological care contribution
    And reduce consumption through extended equipment lifespan
    And build bioregional self-sufficiency through skill transmission
    And Frank's knowledge should serve waste reduction and resilience

  Scenario: Frugality and resource conservation aligned with ecological sustainability
    Given Frank lives on fixed income requiring careful resource management
    And resource conservation serves both budget and ecological goals
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks resource use
    Then it should recognize Frank's frugality as ecological practice
    And resource optimization should be framed as stewardship, not just scarcity
    And his careful consumption should be valued as ecological wisdom
    And practices like reducing waste and buying quality should be celebrated
    And economic constraint should be understood as ecological virtue
    And Frank's lifestyle should model sustainable consumption

  Scenario: Buying quality tools and materials that last reduces resource extraction
    Given Frank learned to invest in quality tools and materials
    And durability reduces waste and manufacturing impact
    When Frank makes purchasing decisions
    Then his personal_agent should support quality-over-quantity choices
    And the bioregional_elohim should track durability practices
    And buying quality should be recognized as ecological stewardship
    And Frank's knowledge of durability should inform others
    And throwaway culture should be countered by his construction wisdom
    And consumption patterns should favor longevity and repairability

  Scenario: Local material sourcing reduces transportation impact
    Given Frank's construction work requires materials
    And material transportation has significant carbon footprint
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates material sourcing
    Then it should facilitate use of locally-sourced materials
    And connect Frank to local salvage and reclaimed material sources
    And reduce transportation impact through bioregional supply chains
    And recognize local sourcing as ecological care contribution
    And strengthen bioregional material economies
    And Frank's work should demonstrate local material viability

  Scenario: Construction waste reduction and material reuse
    Given construction generates substantial waste
    And Frank has knowledge of material reuse and salvage
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks construction waste
    Then it should help Frank minimize waste in Habitat projects
    And facilitate salvaging and reusing materials
    And recognize waste reduction as ecological care contribution
    And teach construction waste minimization to others
    And quantify environmental benefit of material reuse
    And Frank's expertise should reduce construction environmental impact

  Scenario: Water conservation in construction and household practices
    Given water is critical bioregional resource
    And Frank's construction knowledge includes plumbing systems
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates water stewardship
    Then it should facilitate water-efficient plumbing in Habitat work
    And help Frank repair leaks and improve water systems in community
    And track water conservation as ecological care contribution
    And teach water conservation practices to community
    And Frank's skills should serve bioregional water security
    And his expertise should build water-wise infrastructure

  Scenario: Passive solar and natural ventilation in building design
    Given Frank has construction experience with building orientation and design
    And passive solar and ventilation reduce energy consumption
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates sustainable building
    Then it should facilitate passive design elements in Habitat projects
    And help Frank apply climate-appropriate building techniques
    And recognize building design knowledge as ecological expertise
    And quantify energy savings from passive design choices
    And teach sustainable design principles to younger builders
    And Frank's knowledge should serve low-energy building practices

  Scenario: Elder knowledge of historical building techniques and materials
    Given Frank has decades of construction experience
    And traditional building techniques are often more sustainable
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates building knowledge
    Then it should value Frank's knowledge of traditional techniques
    And facilitate teaching historical building methods
    And recognize that older practices may be more ecological
    And connect past building wisdom to contemporary sustainability
    And Frank's experience should inform bioregional building culture
    And elder knowledge should guide sustainable building revival

  Scenario: Tool sharing and maintenance reduces consumption and waste
    Given Frank has accumulated quality tools over decades
    And tool sharing reduces unnecessary consumption
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates tool libraries
    Then it should facilitate Frank sharing tools with community
    And help him teach tool maintenance and care
    And recognize tool sharing as ecological and community contribution
    And reduce tool consumption through shared resources
    And Frank's tool knowledge should serve community self-sufficiency
    And his participation should model sharing economy practices

  Scenario: Bioregional construction material knowledge and sourcing
    Given Frank knows regional building materials and their properties
    And bioregional materials reduce transportation and support local economy
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates material knowledge
    Then it should help Frank teach about regional construction materials
