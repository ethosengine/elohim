Scenario: Identity development beyond student role
    Given Kenji's identity is currently shaped by being a student
    And he will graduate and transition to other adult roles
    When the personal_agent supports Kenji's identity development
    Then it should recognize him as complete person beyond student status
    And it should support his interests in environmental science as life calling
    And it should help him build identity that will persist after graduation
    And it should validate his current contributions (cooking, care work) as real
    And the agent should support integrated identity across contexts
    And Kenji should develop sense of self beyond temporary student role
