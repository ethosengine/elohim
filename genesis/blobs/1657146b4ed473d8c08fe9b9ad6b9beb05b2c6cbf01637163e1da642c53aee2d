Scenario: Family cultural and value transmission through grandparenting
    Given Margaret carries family history, traditions, and values
    And she teaches these to grandchildren through care relationship
    When the family_elohim tracks cultural transmission
    Then it should recognize this as valuable family work
    And it should support Margaret's role as family culture keeper
    And it should value intergenerational wisdom sharing
    And cultural education should be recognized as care labor
    And family identity should be strengthened across generations
    And Margaret's teaching should be appreciated and supported
