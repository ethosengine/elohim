Scenario: Supplier networks transfer to democratic worker management
    Given Rosa negotiated with parts suppliers and built distributor relationships
    And these networks are essential for business operations
    When supplier relationship transition occurs
    Then Rosa introduces workers to her supplier contacts personally
    And relationship trust transfers through Rosa's endorsement
    And workers learn negotiation strategies and supplier quality assessment
    And EAE network provides volume purchasing power Rosa never had
    And supplier relationships professionalize under democratic governance
