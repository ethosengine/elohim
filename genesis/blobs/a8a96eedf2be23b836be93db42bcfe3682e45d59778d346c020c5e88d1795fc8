Scenario: Performance evaluation accounts for part-time status and accommodations
    Given Alex works part-time with accommodations
    And performance should be measured appropriately for Alex's situation
    When Alex receives performance evaluations
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex ensure fair evaluation
    And expectations should be adjusted for part-time hours worked
    And accommodations should not be held against Alex
    And productivity should be measured per hours worked, not full-time standard
    And disability-related absences should not negatively impact evaluation
    And the protocol should support Alex in advocating for fair treatment
    And evaluation should recognize Alex's actual contributions accurately
