Feature: Environmental and Climate Policy Governance for Elected Representative
  As a politician in the public_observer system
  Operating at the ecological governance layer
  I want to make informed environmental policy decisions
  So that I can balance environmental protection with economic development and serve long-term community resilience

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the politician user is registered in the system
    And the ecological governance context is active

  Scenario: Politician understands environmental justice patterns in jurisdiction
    Given the politician governs environmental policy at city or state level
    And suspects environmental burdens fall disproportionately
    When the Observer maps environmental conditions and demographics
    Then they see pollution sources concentrated in communities of color
    And identify park access disparities by neighborhood income
    And understand health impact patterns from environmental exposure
    And learn which communities bear cumulative environmental burdens
    And champion environmental justice policies with documented inequities

  Scenario: Politician evaluates polluting facility permit with comprehensive analysis
    Given company applies for permit to operate polluting facility
    And promises economic benefits and claims minimal environmental impact
    When the Observer analyzes facility proposal and company track record
    Then they see company's violation history at other locations
    And understand health impacts on nearby residential populations
    And identify existing pollution burden in target neighborhood
    And review economic claims against actual job creation in similar facilities
    And make informed decision balancing economics with environmental protection

  Scenario: Politician tracks accountability for climate action commitments
    Given the politician pledged to reduce municipal carbon emissions
    And committed to specific climate resilience investments
    When the Observer monitors climate commitment implementation
    Then they see actual emissions trends versus reduction targets
    And identify which climate initiatives launched versus stalled
    And understand budget allocation for climate versus other priorities
    And receive alerts when commitments fall behind schedule
    And maintain accountability for climate action promises

  Scenario: Politician surfaces constituent environmental priorities beyond loudest voices
    Given the politician hears from passionate environmental activists
    But uncertain whether priorities reflect broader community
    When the Observer aggregates constituent environmental sentiment
    Then they see working families prioritize air quality and park access
    And learn parents care about safe outdoor spaces for children
    And identify senior concerns about extreme heat vulnerability
    And understand environmental priorities across diverse constituents
    And align policy with community environmental needs

  Scenario: Politician evaluates climate adaptation investments with equity focus
    Given climate change requires infrastructure resilience investments
    And limited resources force priority-setting across neighborhoods
    When the Observer analyzes climate vulnerability and adaptation patterns
    Then they see flood risk concentrated in low-income neighborhoods
    And identify heat island effects in communities lacking tree canopy
    And understand which populations most vulnerable to climate impacts
    And ensure resilience investments prioritize environmental justice
    And allocate climate adaptation funding equitably

  Scenario: Politician builds coalition for green infrastructure investment
    Given the politician champions urban tree canopy expansion
    And needs support across diverse constituencies
    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities
    Then they see environmental groups support ecological benefits
    And identify public health advocates concerned about heat and air quality
    And connect with neighborhood groups seeking park improvements
    And facilitate coalition across environmental and equity interests
    And build broad-based support for green infrastructure

  Scenario: Politician distinguishes industry fear-mongering from legitimate economic concerns
    Given industry lobbyists claim environmental regulation will destroy jobs
    And present catastrophic economic projections
    When the Observer fact-checks industry claims with evidence
    Then they see similar regulations in comparable jurisdictions
    And review actual employment impacts versus predicted job losses
    And identify compliance costs versus health and environmental benefits
    And understand which industries adapted successfully to regulations
    And resist manipulation through evidence-based economic analysis

  Scenario: Politician monitors environmental agency enforcement patterns
    Given the politician has oversight of environmental regulators
    And community groups report lax enforcement
    When the Observer tracks environmental compliance and enforcement
    Then they see violation patterns by facility and location
    And identify enforcement disparities by neighborhood demographics
    And understand whether penalties effectively deter violations
    And learn which facilities are repeat violators
    And demand stronger enforcement protecting community health

  Scenario: Politician evaluates renewable energy policy with comprehensive analysis
    Given competing proposals for renewable energy development
    And conflicting claims about costs and benefits
    When the Observer analyzes renewable energy options and impacts
    Then they see cost trajectories of different energy sources
    And understand job creation in renewable versus fossil fuel sectors
    And identify environmental and health benefits of clean energy
    And review successful renewable policies in other jurisdictions
    And make informed energy policy decisions beyond ideology

  Scenario: Politician navigates development pressure with environmental accountability
    Given developer proposes project with environmental impacts
    And campaign contributions create perception of conflict
    When the Observer documents environmental impacts and relationships
    Then they see project's environmental footprint objectively analyzed
    And identify developer's environmental track record
    And understand campaign finance relationships made publicly visible
    And review community environmental concerns systematically
    And make transparent decision accountable to environmental and community interests
