    And these responsibilities must be balanced
    When the community_elohim tracks Margaret's total contributions
    Then it should recognize both family and community care
    And it should help Margaret balance multiple care obligations
    And it should ensure community service is sustainable alongside family care
    And total care burden should be visible and manageable
    And Margaret should be able to contribute without burnout
    And community should respect her family care commitments
