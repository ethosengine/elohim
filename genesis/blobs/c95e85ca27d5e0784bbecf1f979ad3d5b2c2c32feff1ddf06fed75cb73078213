Scenario: Municipal workforce development integrates democratic business training
    Given city workforce programs train workers for traditional employment
    And democratic governance requires different skills (facilitation, collaboration, shared decision-making)
    When municipality recognizes democratic businesses need prepared workers
    Then workforce development programs include cooperative business training
    And workers learn democratic governance skills alongside technical skills
    And community colleges offer worker ownership and democratic management courses
    And municipal investment in workforce development supports democratic economy growth
    And municipality_elohim develops democratic business curriculum for workforce programs
