Scenario: Building care relationships that support Margaret's own aging
    Given Margaret is building community care networks now
    And she will need community support as she ages
    When the community_elohim tracks care relationship development
    Then it should recognize Margaret is building future care security
    And her current contributions should create community reciprocity
    And community members she helps now will support her later
    And community care networks should enable aging in place
    And Margaret's care work should create long-term community integration
    And care economy should provide retirement security beyond finances
