Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent
  As a single parent managing family relationships and decisions alone
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to serve each child's needs while managing family dynamics without co-parent support
  So that my children thrive despite having only one actively present parent

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the single parent user "Maria" is registered in the system
    And Maria is the only actively parenting adult for three children
    And children are ages 6, 9, and 14 with different developmental needs
    And Maria has no co-parent to consult or share parenting decisions
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim provides family relationship support

  Scenario: Being the only parent relationship for three children simultaneously
    Given Maria is her children's primary relationship and security
    And she provides all parental emotional support alone
    When children need parental attention and connection
    Then the family_elohim should help Maria serve each child's relationship needs
    And it should remind her that she's their entire parental support system
    And it should help her distribute attention across three children fairly
    And it should validate the weight of being their only secure adult attachment
    And Maria should have support for impossible emotional labor of solo parenting

  Scenario: Solo parenting decisions without partner consultation or validation
    Given Maria makes every parenting decision alone
    And she has no co-parent to discuss, debate, or validate choices
    When Maria faces difficult parenting decisions
    Then the family_elohim should provide decision support and perspective
    And it should help her think through consequences and options
    And it should partially fill the gap of missing partner consultation
    And it should validate her decision-making authority
    And Maria should have AI thinking partner for parenting choices

  Scenario: Managing children's grief and questions about absent co-parent
    Given children may grieve or question their absent other parent
    And Maria must handle these emotions while managing her own feelings
    When children express feelings about family structure
    Then the family_elohim should help Maria respond appropriately to each child's age
    And it should remind her to validate their feelings without defensiveness
    And it should help her maintain healthy narrative about family structure
    And it should support her in helping children process complicated family reality
    And Maria should have guidance for emotionally complex parenting situations

  Scenario: Serving 6-year-old's wonder needs while managing two other children
    Given her youngest child is at peak wonder and exploration stage
    And this age needs substantial parental engagement and presence
    When Maria serves her 6-year-old's developmental needs
    Then the family_elohim should remind her of age-appropriate activities
    And it should help her protect wonder time despite other demands
    And it should prevent youngest from being neglected due to older siblings' needs
    And it should help her be present for this critical developmental stage
    And Maria should successfully nurture her youngest despite impossible time constraints

  Scenario: Navigating 9-year-old's growing autonomy and competence
    Given her middle child is developing independence and self-direction
    And this age needs balance of freedom and parental guidance
    When Maria parents her 9-year-old
    Then the family_elohim should help her calibrate appropriate autonomy
    And it should remind her of developmental milestones to support
    And it should help her stay connected while allowing necessary independence
    And it should prevent middle child from being lost between younger and older siblings
    And Maria should serve this complex developmental stage effectively

  Scenario: Managing 14-year-old's teen complexity and emerging adulthood
    Given her oldest is navigating adolescence with all its challenges
    And teens need parent as secure base while pushing for independence
    When Maria parents her teenager
    Then the family_elohim should provide teen development guidance
    And it should help her maintain connection despite natural teen separation
    And it should remind her to stay engaged even when teen seems not to want her
    And it should help her navigate discipline, boundaries, and growing autonomy
    And Maria should successfully parent a teen without co-parent support

  Scenario: Preventing oldest child from becoming surrogate parent to younger siblings
    Given Maria's 14-year-old may feel responsible for younger siblings
    And parentification is common and harmful in single-parent families
    When the family_elohim monitors family dynamics
    Then it should detect if teen is taking on too much parental responsibility
    And it should alert Maria to concerning patterns
    And it should help her accept appropriate help while preventing harmful role-reversal
    And it should protect her teen's adolescence and development
    And the protocol should prevent damage from well-intentioned but unhealthy dynamics

  Scenario: Extended family support coordination with maintained boundaries
    Given Maria may receive support from her own parents or siblings
    And extended family help can be complicated by distance or family dynamics
    When extended family contributes to children's care
    Then the family_elohim should track and coordinate extended family involvement
    And it should help Maria maintain boundaries around parenting authority
    And it should recognize extended family contributions without ceding control
    And it should prevent grandparents or others from overstepping
    And Maria should retain parental sovereignty while accepting help

  Scenario: Family rituals and traditions maintained by solo parent
    Given Maria wants to create meaningful family traditions and rituals
    And she must plan and execute all traditions alone
    When family traditions and special occasions occur
    Then the family_elohim should help Maria plan manageable family rituals
    And it should remind her of important traditions and celebrations
    And it should help her create meaningful family culture despite time constraints
    And it should prevent holiday stress from overwhelming solo parent capacity
    And Maria's family should have rich traditions despite single-parent limitations

  Scenario: Managing sibling conflicts with no co-parent to tag team
    Given children will conflict with each other
    And Maria handles all conflict resolution alone with no one to tag in
    When sibling conflicts arise
    Then the family_elohim should provide conflict resolution guidance
    And it should help Maria address conflicts fairly and age-appropriately
    And it should remind her to stay calm when she's the only adult managing chaos
    And it should prevent her exhaustion from leading to ineffective responses
    And Maria should successfully navigate sibling dynamics without co-parent backup

  Scenario: Individual quality time with each child despite impossible schedule
    Given each child needs one-on-one parent time
    And Maria must provide all individual attention alone across three children
    When Maria allocates time with children
    Then the family_elohim should help her protect individual connection time
    And it should remind her that each child needs her undivided attention sometimes
    And it should coordinate schedules to create brief one-on-one moments
    And it should prevent any child from being consistently neglected
    And Maria should maintain individual relationships with each child despite constraints

  Scenario: Family care tokens reflect Maria's role as sole active parent
    Given Maria provides all active parenting for three children
    And she's performing care work of two parents alone
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Maria's tokens should reflect solo parenting of multiple children
    And the protocol should recognize she's providing all emotional support, guidance, and presence
    And her care contributions should be valued higher than partnered parents
    And quantified solo parenting work should validate her superhuman efforts
    And society should see undeniable proof that single parents deserve extraordinary support

  Scenario: Maintaining hope for children's thriving despite single-parent family structure
    Given society often assumes single-parent families are inherently deficient
    And Maria worries about impact of solo parenting on her children
    When the family_elohim assesses family well-being
    Then it should recognize that children can thrive in single-parent families
    And it should validate Maria's parenting rather than reinforcing deficit narratives
    And it should help her see her children's actual thriving, not societal stereotypes
    And it should remind her that she is enough for her children
    And Maria should feel empowered as parent, not defined by family structure stigma
