Scenario: Worker controls their own REA (Resource-Event-Agent) profile data
    Given Maria has worked at ChickenMax for 8 years
    And her REA profile documents her contributions across multiple dimensions
    When Maria requests to view her complete REA profile
    Then she sees her documented expertise (847 perfect fryer batches, 47 hours training given)
    And she sees her care work (comforting customers, mentoring colleagues)
    And she sees her efficiency improvements ($3,400 waste eliminated)
    And she controls what portions of her profile to share externally
    And she can export her profile if she changes jobs
    And no corporate entity can access her data without her consent
