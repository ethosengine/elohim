Scenario: Addressing industry culture of exploitation
    Given food service industry culture normalizes worker exploitation
    When workers want to transform industry culture
    Then the protocol should support cultural change advocacy
    And help workers articulate vision for dignified food service work
    And build consciousness that current conditions are unjust not inevitable
    And create movement for care-economy-aligned industry transformation
