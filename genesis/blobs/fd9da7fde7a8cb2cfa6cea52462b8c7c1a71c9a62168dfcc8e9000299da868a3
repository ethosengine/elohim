Scenario: Asserting parenting authority despite institutional scrutiny
    Given institutions are monitoring my parenting during crisis
    And I fear judgment or intervention
    When I make parenting decisions based on my knowledge of my children
    Then the Value Scanner validates my parental authority
    And documents my sophisticated parenting labor
    And helps me articulate my parenting reasoning to institutions
    And recognizes that I am the expert on my children's needs
    And supports me in resisting inappropriate institutional interference
    And my personal_agent helps me present my parenting capability effectively
    And the care token system makes visible my substantial parenting contributions
    And my parenting is recognized as valuable work, not scrutinized as potential failure
