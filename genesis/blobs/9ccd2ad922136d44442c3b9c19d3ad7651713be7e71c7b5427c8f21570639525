Scenario: Municipal crisis response coordinates with care economy networks
    Given municipal emergency management systems exist
    And care economy has created mutual aid networks
    When municipal crises occur (natural disasters, economic shocks, health emergencies)
    Then the municipal_elohim should coordinate with emergency response
    And existing care networks should be activated for crisis support
    And municipal response should leverage community care capacity
    And care economy should strengthen municipal resilience
    And crisis response should be more effective through coordination
