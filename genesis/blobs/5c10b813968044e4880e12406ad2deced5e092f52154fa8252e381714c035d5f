Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent
  As a grandparent providing substantial care work across generations
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want my autonomy, identity, and care contributions to be recognized
  So that my grandparenting is valued as sophisticated work, not just leisure

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the grandparent user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret is 68 years old, retired from nursing
    And Margaret provides 25 hours/week childcare for grandchildren
    And Margaret also cares for her 92-year-old mother
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Margaret's personal_agent is configured for dignity and autonomy
    And the interface is optimized for accessibility needs

  Scenario: Personal agent preserves Margaret's identity beyond grandparenting
    Given Margaret has her own interests, friendships, and development goals
    And she is not defined solely by caregiving roles
    When Margaret's personal_agent tracks her activities
    Then it should recognize time spent on her own hobbies and interests
    And it should encourage balance between caregiving and personal growth
    And it should protect space for Margaret's continued development
    And it should affirm that her value extends beyond utility
    And Margaret should experience herself as a whole person
    And the system should prevent her identity collapse into "just grandma"
    And her autonomy and personhood should be continuously affirmed

  Scenario: Accessible interface accommodates aging-related needs without patronizing
    Given Margaret has age-related vision and dexterity changes
    And she is a competent adult with decades of nursing experience
    When Margaret uses the Value Scanner
    Then the interface should have large, high-contrast fonts
    And touch targets should be generous and forgiving
    And voice interface options should be available
    And navigation should be simple and consistent
    And the pace should be patient without being condescending
    And the tone should be respectful, never infantilizing
    And Margaret should feel empowered and capable
    And accessibility should enhance rather than diminish dignity

  Scenario: Quantifying grandparent care contributions at individual level
    Given Margaret provides 25 hours/week of active childcare
    And market rate for professional childcare is ~$1,500/month
    When the personal_agent tracks Margaret's care labor
    Then it should quantify all hours spent in active childcare
    And it should calculate economic value of her contributions
    And it should accumulate care tokens for her labor
    And it should recognize developmental benefits beyond market value
    And Margaret should see that her work is substantial and valuable
    And the data should counter narrative of "just spending time with grandkids"
    And her contributions should be visible and quantified

  Scenario: Building care economy capital for future aging needs
    Given Margaret is watching her mother navigate advanced aging
    And Margaret recognizes she will need care in 10-20 years
    When Margaret makes care contributions now
    Then care tokens should accumulate to her individual account
    And these tokens should represent future care economy resources
    And the system should help her build reciprocal relationships
    And she should be preparing for her own increasing care needs
    And current contributions should create future security
    And Margaret should experience agency in planning her own aging
    And care economy capital should provide retirement resilience

  Scenario: Maintaining capacity boundaries for sustainable care provision
    Given Margaret is 68 and has her own health considerations
    And excessive care burden could compromise her well-being
    When the personal_agent monitors Margaret's care load
    Then it should track whether care labor exceeds healthy capacity
    And it should alert if Margaret is sacrificing her own health
    And it should suggest when to renegotiate care arrangements
    And it should help her maintain sustainable care levels
    And Margaret should be able to provide care without burning out
    And the system should protect her well-being while valuing her contributions
    And capacity monitoring should enable long-term care sustainability

  Scenario: Privacy control over multigenerational care data
    Given Margaret's data includes information about grandchildren and her mother
    And health information is particularly sensitive
    When Margaret determines data sharing preferences
    Then she must have complete control over all her data
    And she should choose what's shared with family members
    And she can demonstrate care value to family if she wishes
    And she can maintain complete privacy if she prefers
    And health data sharing must be explicitly consented
    And Margaret's autonomy over her information must be absolute
    And privacy across generations must be carefully managed

  Scenario: Recognition that grandparenting is care work, not leisure activity
    Given traditional culture frames grandparenting as "fun" and "spoiling"
    And Margaret's labor is often invisible as work
    When the personal_agent characterizes Margaret's activities
    Then it should frame grandparenting as sophisticated care labor
    And it should recognize developmental care, emotional support, practical childcare
    And it should distinguish between leisure time with grandkids and care work
    And it should make visible that Margaret is providing essential services
    And the narrative should shift from "babysitting" to care provision
    And Margaret's work should be taken seriously as economic contribution
    And her care labor should be recognized as valuable work

  Scenario: Managing fixed retirement income while providing care
    Given Margaret lives on retirement income that cannot be increased
    And grandparenting sometimes involves expenses (activities, treats, supplies)
    When Margaret's personal_agent tracks spending related to grandchildren
    Then it should help her budget for grandparenting costs
    And it should identify when care provision creates financial burden
    And it should suggest discussions with family about cost-sharing
    And it should help Margaret maintain dignity while managing constraints
    And the system should prevent financial exploitation of grandparents
    And Margaret should be able to provide care without financial hardship

  Scenario: Tracking health considerations relevant to safe childcare
    Given Margaret takes medications and has health conditions
    And she needs to provide safe, active care for young children
    When the personal_agent monitors Margaret's health status
    Then it should track whether health enables safe childcare
    And it should flag if medications or conditions affect caregiving capacity
    And it should suggest when to communicate limitations to family
    And it should support Margaret's health management
    And it should ensure children's safety while preserving Margaret's dignity
    And health monitoring should enable safe, sustainable care provision

  Scenario: Personal growth and learning opportunities in retirement
    Given Margaret is in early retirement with decades of life ahead
    And she values continued learning and development
    When the personal_agent tracks Margaret's activities
    Then it should encourage and support continued education
    And it should suggest learning opportunities aligned with her interests
    And it should recognize that retirement is not the end of growth
    And it should help her balance caregiving with personal development
    And Margaret should experience retirement as liberation for new pursuits
    And the system should affirm her capacity for continued growth and contribution

  Scenario: Right to reduce or discontinue care provision with dignity
    Given Margaret's care contributions are substantial but voluntary
    And her capacity may change with health or life circumstances
    When Margaret needs to reduce or stop grandparenting
    Then the system should support this decision without stigma
    And accumulated care tokens should remain hers regardless
    And the family should have data showing her past contributions
    And Margaret should be able to transition care with dignity
    And she should not feel guilty for setting boundaries
    And the protocol should enable graceful changes in care arrangements
    And her autonomy over care provision must be absolute

  Scenario: Recognition of emotional labor in grandparenting role
    Given Margaret provides not just practical care but emotional support
    And she navigates complex family dynamics with wisdom
    When the personal_agent tracks Margaret's care contributions
    Then it should recognize emotional labor as work
    And it should value relationship maintenance and family harmony
    And it should acknowledge the sophistication of intergenerational care
    And it should quantify not just hours but quality of care
    And emotional labor should be visible and valued
    And Margaret's wisdom and relationship work should be recognized
    And the full dimension of grandparenting care should be appreciated
