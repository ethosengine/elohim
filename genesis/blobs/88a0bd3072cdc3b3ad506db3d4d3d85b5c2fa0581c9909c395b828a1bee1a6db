Scenario: Individual skill development beyond parenting role
    Given Sarah has professional teaching capabilities
    And she has interests beyond children and household
    When the personal_agent supports Sarah's development
    Then it should encourage skill-building in non-parenting domains
    And it should help her maintain professional identity
    And it should support her creative interests and intellectual growth
    And Sarah should have space to develop as complete person
    And the system should prevent parenting from consuming total identity
    And individual growth should be valued as essential to sustainability
