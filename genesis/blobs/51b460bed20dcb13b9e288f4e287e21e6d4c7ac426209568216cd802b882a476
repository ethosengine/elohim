Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Young Child
  As a young child in the value scanner system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want my care contributions to be visible to my family
  So that I am recognized as a valued contributor to family flourishing

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the young_child user "Tommy" is registered in the system
    And Tommy is part of a family unit with parent Sarah and sister Emma
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim is coordinating family care economy
    And Tommy's personal_agent communicates with family_elohim

  Scenario: Young child's care work made visible to family
    Given Tommy has chosen strawberries for his sister Emma
    And the care contribution has been recorded by personal_agent
    When the family_elohim processes the contribution
    Then Tommy's care work should be visible on the family dashboard
    And parent Sarah should receive specific prompts
    And the prompt should say "Tommy chose strawberries for Emma"
    And the care contribution should be attributed to Tommy by name
    And family care tokens should reflect his contribution
    And the visibility should enable parental recognition

  Scenario: Family boundaries shape young child's scanner permissions
    Given Tommy's parents have set family values and boundaries
    And the family has budget constraints of $40k/year household income
    And Emma has a nut allergy
    And the family prioritizes nutritional guidelines
    When Tommy uses the Value Scanner
    Then his personal_agent should enforce family boundaries invisibly
    And budget-aware selections should be guided
    And allergen items should be blocked without Tommy's awareness
    And nutritionally appropriate options should be highlighted
    And Tommy should experience boundaries as care, not control

  Scenario: Sibling care relationships built through value recognition
    Given Tommy regularly selects items for his sister Emma
    And Emma is 7 years old
    When Tommy makes care contributions targeting Emma
    Then the family_elohim should track sibling care patterns
    And positive feedback loops should be created
    And Tommy's personal_agent should reference past successes: "Emma loved the strawberries you picked last time"
    And Emma should be prompted to recognize Tommy's care
    And sibling relationships should be based on mutual care, not competition
    And the protocol should build family bonds through care visibility

  Scenario: Family care token allocation includes young child contributions
    Given the family participates in care token economy
    And Tommy has made multiple care contributions
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Tommy's contributions should be valued appropriately
    And his care work should not be dismissed as "just helping"
    And tokens should accumulate to the family account
    And Tommy should have age-appropriate awareness of his contributions
    And the family should receive care token supplements for low income
    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status

  Scenario: Parental oversight protects young child while honoring agency
    Given Tommy has genuine autonomy in the scanner
    And he is only 5 years old
    When Tommy makes selections
    Then parental oversight should be supreme
    And Sarah should have full visibility into Tommy's scanner usage
    And Sarah should control what data is recorded
    And Tommy's agency should be preserved within parental boundaries
    And the balance should protect both safety and autonomy
    And Sarah should not experience anxiety about granting Tommy freedom

  Scenario: Family shopping as shared care experience
    Given Tommy is shopping with parent Sarah
    And multiple family members have different needs
    When they use the Value Scanner together
    Then Tommy should be learning from Sarah's modeling
    And Sarah should be teaching Tommy value literacy through action
    And the family_elohim should coordinate their different roles
    And Tommy's contributions should be recognized alongside Sarah's
    And shopping should be experienced as family care work, not consumption
    And care economy principles should be transmitted through relationship

  Scenario: Young child contributes to family decision making appropriately
    Given the family is making decisions about meals
    And Tommy has preferences and care intentions
    When Tommy's input is solicited through the scanner
    Then his preferences should be honored age-appropriately
    And his care intentions (choosing for others) should carry weight
    And the family_elohim should balance Tommy's input with family needs
    And Tommy should experience having voice in family governance
    And his participation should be genuine, not token
    And family decisions should reflect that all members contribute

  Scenario: Multigenerational family care patterns include young child
    Given Tommy's grandparent is part of the extended family
    And the grandparent provides childcare
    When Tommy interacts with grandparent through care economy
    Then his care contributions should be visible to grandparent
    And grandparent's care for Tommy should be tracked
    And the family_elohim should coordinate across generations
    And Tommy should learn that care flows in multiple directions
    And family care economy should span beyond nuclear household

  Scenario: Family cultural values shape young child's value formation
    Given Tommy's family has specific cultural values
    And these values are configured in the family_elohim
    When Tommy makes care decisions
    Then the guidance should align with family cultural context
    And his personal_agent should reinforce family values
    And value literacy should be culturally appropriate
    And the protocol should serve the family's chosen value framework
    And diverse family cultures should be respected

  Scenario: Young child's care patterns inform family resource allocation
    Given Tommy has established care contribution patterns
    And the family makes resource allocation decisions
    When the family_elohim analyzes care economy data
    Then Tommy's care patterns should inform family planning
    And his demonstrated care for Emma should be considered
    And resource decisions should reflect all family members' contributions
    And Tommy should experience being valued in family economics
    And his care work should give him legitimate standing in family decisions

  Scenario: Family provides recognition that builds young child's care identity
    Given Tommy has made care contributions over weeks
    And the family_elohim has tracked patterns
    When family recognition moments occur
    Then Sarah should receive prompts for specific acknowledgment
    And recognition should highlight Tommy's care work
    And acknowledgment should feel genuine, not mechanical
    And Tommy should internalize identity as caring family member
    And positive reinforcement should build care-centered self-concept
    And the family should collectively value invisible care labor
