Scenario: Soil health improvements are documented and knowledge is shared
    Given soil degradation is systemic problem in industrial agriculture
    And regenerative soil building requires knowledge and long-term commitment
    When democratic farms document and share soil health practices
    Then soil testing shows organic matter increases and biological activity improvements
    And successful practices are shared across bioregional farm network
    And soil health knowledge accumulates and spreads through democratic coordination
    And bioregional soil regeneration accelerates through collective learning
    And bioregional_elohim manages soil health documentation and knowledge sharing
