Scenario: Council member distinguishes grassroots from astroturf campaign
    Given the politician receives flood of emails opposing rent control
    And campaigns look like authentic constituent concern
    When the Observer analyzes communication patterns
    Then they see template messages from industry lobbying firm
    And identify coordinated timing and identical language
    And distinguish 5 genuine constituent concerns from 200 manufactured messages
    And understand actual constituent sentiment versus manipulation
    And make decisions based on real community needs
