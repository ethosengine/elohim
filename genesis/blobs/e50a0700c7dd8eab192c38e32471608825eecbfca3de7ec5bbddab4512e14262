Scenario: Community participation builds resources for Robert's own aging
    Given Robert is preparing for his own eventual care needs
    And community participation now builds networks for later
    And care economy operates on long-term reciprocity
    When community_elohim helps Robert plan for aging
    Then it should help him see that current community participation builds future support
    And recognize that relationships now will remain as he ages
    And surface how care tokens accumulate toward future care
    And support him in building community that will serve his aging
    And demonstrate that care economy investment pays forward
    And help him prepare for aging with dignity through community connection
    And recognize that community care is lifecycle reciprocity
