Scenario: Family education about disability justice improves relationships
    Given family relationships improve when family understands disability better
    And many families lack disability justice frameworks
    When the family_elohim detects ableist patterns
    Then it should provide family members with educational resources
    And it should prompt family toward social model understanding
    And it should share disability culture and community perspectives
    And family should be invited to learn from Alex's expertise
    And education should be offered supportively, not punitively
    And the goal should be transforming family culture toward inclusion
    And better understanding should enable healthier family relationships
