Scenario: Neighborhood shopping patterns affect local product availability
    Given Emma shops at local grocery store
    And the store stocks products based on community demand
    When Emma consistently chooses certain products
    Then she should learn her choices influence what stores carry
    And her personal_agent should explain "When families buy local produce, stores stock more of it"
    And Emma should understand demand shapes supply at community level
    And she should see connection between individual choice and collective power
    And economic literacy should include understanding market dynamics
    And she should learn communities shape local economies
