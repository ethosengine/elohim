Scenario: Activist detects surveillance attempt and activates sanctuary
    Given the activist is organizing a climate justice campaign
    And they have shared organizing documents with their local group
    When the system detects repeated unauthorized access attempts to their node
    And the protection agent identifies a pattern indicating state surveillance
    Then the activist receives immediate alert with threat assessment
    And sanctuary protocol options are presented
    And the activist can choose to fragment data across sanctuary institutions
    And organizing continues through secure channels
    And the community is alerted to heightened security measures
