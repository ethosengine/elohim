Scenario: Value literacy education through lived experience at advanced age
    Given Helen uses Value Scanner with assistance
    And she's learning care economy principles through practice
    When Helen makes care-based decisions
    Then she should be learning that her contributions still matter
    And value literacy should be accessible at all ages
    And care economy principles should be demonstrated through her experience
    And she should understand that care has value regardless of age
    And the protocol should teach through experience, not explanation
    And Helen should internalize that she has worth beyond productivity
    And care economy education should include all ages
