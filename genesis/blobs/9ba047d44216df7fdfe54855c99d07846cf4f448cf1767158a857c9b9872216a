Scenario: Guided learning through Socratic questioning not instruction
    Given Emma is comparing two products
    And her personal_agent uses inquiry-based teaching
    When Emma asks for help deciding
    Then the agent should ask "What do you notice about these two options?"
    And the agent should not say "Choose this one"
    And the agent should prompt critical thinking
    And the agent should ask follow-up questions based on Emma's observations
    And Emma should develop her own reasoning capacity
    And she should learn to think, not just follow rules
    And the pedagogical approach should respect her as a thinker
