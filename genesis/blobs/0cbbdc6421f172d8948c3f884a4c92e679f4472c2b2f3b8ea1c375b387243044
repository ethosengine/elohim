Scenario: Differentiating children's developmental stages in family care
    Given Tommy (5) needs wonder-preservation and tight boundaries
    And Emma (8) needs guided autonomy and increasing responsibility
    When Sarah coordinates family care activities
    Then the family_elohim should maintain different permission levels
    And Tommy's interactions should preserve developmental appropriateness
    And Emma's interactions should support growing independence
    And Sarah should manage each child's needs specifically
    And developmental stages should be respected within family context
