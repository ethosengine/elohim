Scenario: Personal agent serves as cognitive partner for impossible complexity
    Given Sarah must coordinate Tommy's wonder-preservation with Emma's autonomy-building
    And also manage budget, nutrition, schedules, and her work responsibilities
    When Sarah uses her personal_agent for decision support
    Then the agent should hold all relevant factors simultaneously
    And it should surface conflicts: "Tommy needs experiential learning but you have 20 minutes before work"
    And it should suggest realistic solutions within constraints
    And it should reduce cognitive load dramatically
    And Sarah should experience genuine partnership
    And the agent should make impossible complexity manageable
