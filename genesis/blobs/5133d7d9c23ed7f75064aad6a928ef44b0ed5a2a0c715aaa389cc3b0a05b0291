Scenario: Emergency global appeal during existential threat
    Given AI agents worldwide detect imminent catastrophic risk
    And agents take coordinated action affecting billions
    And appellants challenge actions as overreach despite emergency
    When global Constitutional Council reviews in crisis
    Then the council convenes within hours via distributed coordination
    And the council maintains democratic legitimacy under extreme urgency
    And the council evaluates whether agent actions aligned with constitutional minimums
    And the council balances extinction prevention with human autonomy
    And appellants ensure even existential crisis doesn't eliminate oversight
    And humanity retains governance authority even in emergency
