Scenario: Grandparent role supported as new generation emerges
    Given Robert occasionally provides care for his grandchild
    And he's learning the grandparent role
    And his care enables his adult child to work
    When family_elohim tracks grandparent care contributions
    Then it should recognize grandparent care as valuable family contribution
    And help Robert understand his role in the four-generation family
    And support him in providing care without overstepping parenting boundaries
    And recognize that his grandparent care enables the middle generation
    And value his care appropriately in family care economy
    And help him see himself as part of ongoing care reciprocity
    And model care patterns for when he'll need care
