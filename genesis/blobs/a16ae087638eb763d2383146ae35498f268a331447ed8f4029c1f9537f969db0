Scenario: Journalist investigates regional economic inequality patterns
    Given the journalist covers regional economy
    And economic growth statistics mask inequality
    When the Observer analyzes economic data by demographics and geography
    Then the journalist sees wage growth concentrated in top income brackets
    And documents working-class wage stagnation despite economic growth claims
    And shows poverty increasing in communities of color despite job growth
    And identifies industries paying poverty wages receiving subsidies
    And publishes investigation exposing economic inequality
    And pattern recognition reveals who benefits from "strong economy"
