Scenario: Documenting family care for workplace advocacy
    Given family care responsibilities are real and ongoing
    When I need to advocate for family-friendly workplace policies
    Then the protocol should help me document family care demands
    And provide evidence of work-family conflict
    And support me in requesting accommodations or policy changes
    And empower me to advocate for care-economy-aligned employment
