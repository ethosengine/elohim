Scenario: Child's substantive care contributions visible to family
    Given Emma has made budget-conscious cereal choice
    And she selected store brand to save $2
    When the family_elohim processes the contribution
    Then Emma's stewardship should be visible on family dashboard
    And parent Sarah should receive specific recognition prompts
    And the prompt should highlight Emma's economic reasoning
    And the contribution should be attributed with concrete impact
    And family care tokens should reflect genuine value created
    And visibility should enable meaningful parental acknowledgment
