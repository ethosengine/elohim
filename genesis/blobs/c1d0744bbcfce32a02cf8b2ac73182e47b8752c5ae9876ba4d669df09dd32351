Scenario: Teen learns to value ecosystem services
    Given Jasmine benefits from clean water, air, and functional ecosystems
    And ecosystem services are typically invisible in market economy
    When bioregional_elohim explains ecosystem dependencies
    Then it should teach her about ecosystem services she depends on
    And show how wetlands filter water, forests stabilize climate, and pollinators enable food production
    And help her understand that ecosystems provide care that sustains human life
    And recognize that ecosystem health is prerequisite for all other care
    And value ecological stewardship as foundational care work
    And build understanding that economy depends on ecology, not the other way around
