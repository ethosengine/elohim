Scenario: Skilled volunteer labor valued at market rates for community contribution
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity
    And he provides skilled construction labor
    And this work has clear market value (~$40/hour for skilled trades)
    When the community_elohim tracks volunteer contributions
    Then Frank's volunteer labor should be quantified specifically
    And market value should be calculated (~$20k/year contribution)
    And his skilled labor should be recognized as substantial community asset
    And community care tokens should accumulate from volunteer work
    And Frank should see quantified value of his contribution
    And the narrative of retired as "not contributing" should be countered
    And community should recognize his volunteer work as real economic value
