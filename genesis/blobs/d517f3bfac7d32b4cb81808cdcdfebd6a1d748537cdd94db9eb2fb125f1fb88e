Scenario: Teaching children environmental stewardship through shopping
    Given Sarah is raising Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And she wants them to learn ecological care
    When Sarah uses the Value Scanner with children
    Then the bioregional_elohim should provide age-appropriate environmental education
    And Tommy should learn concrete care for food (not abstract sustainability)
    And Emma should learn connections between care for people and planet
    And shopping should be teaching moment for ecological stewardship
    And children should internalize environmental care as care work
