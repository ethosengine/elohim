Scenario: Analyze whether initial wellbeing gains sustain or decay
    Given early studies showed 8% life satisfaction improvement
    And question is whether gains persist long-term
    When James examines 10-year trajectory
    Then he finds initial gains sustain through Year 5
    And he observes additional gains accumulating in Years 6-10
    And he discovers trust compounds over time
    And he identifies that sustained benefit requires continued democratic participation
    And longitudinal perspective distinguishes honeymoon effects from stable transformation
