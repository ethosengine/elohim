    Given the municipality uses participatory budgeting processes
    And Jasmine has demonstrated civic engagement
    When municipal budget decisions are made
    Then youth voice should be included in budget priority conversations
    And Jasmine's care contributions should give her standing in budget discussions
    And municipal_elohim should facilitate youth participation in participatory budgeting
    And teen input should shape allocation of public resources
    And she should learn that civic participation means influencing resource decisions
    And democratic governance should include all age groups in budget processes
