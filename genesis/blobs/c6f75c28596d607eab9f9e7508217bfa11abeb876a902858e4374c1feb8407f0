Scenario: Multigenerational family gatherings coordinated with care recognition
    Given Margaret often hosts or coordinates family gatherings
    And these gatherings require significant labor
    When Margaret organizes family events
    Then the planning, preparation, and hosting labor should be tracked
    And other family members should see the work involved
    And equitable distribution of hosting burden should be encouraged
    And Margaret's contributions should be recognized and appreciated
    And family gatherings should not depend on her invisible labor
    And care work that makes family connection possible should be valued
