Scenario: Addressing implementation challenges pragmatically
    Given Riverside faces practical problems with protocol
    And elderly residents struggle with technology
    When I work to solve accessibility issues
    Then we maintain: human service windows for tech-reluctant residents
    And we offer: paper-based alternatives to digital interfaces
    And we run: continuous education programs
    And we provide: in-person support and assistance
    And we ensure: no resident excluded due to tech barriers
    And we adapt: implementation to community reality
    And protocol serves: everyone not just tech-savvy
