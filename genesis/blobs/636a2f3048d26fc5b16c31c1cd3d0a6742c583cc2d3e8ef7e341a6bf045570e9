Scenario: Palliative care integration as disease progresses
    Given Alzheimer's is progressive and eventually terminal
    And palliative care improves quality of life before end stage
    When the healthcare_elohim considers palliative care
    Then it should introduce palliative care discussions early
    And it should coordinate palliative services with disease management
    And it should ensure David's comfort and dignity are prioritized
    And James should have support for progressive care needs
    And healthcare should include palliative approach throughout disease
