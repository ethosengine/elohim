Scenario: Documenting workplace violations
    Given my workplace may violate labor laws or regulations
    Including wage theft, unsafe conditions, or scheduling violations
    When I experience potential violations
    Then the workplace_elohim should help me document incidents
    And track patterns of violations over time
