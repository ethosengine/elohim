Scenario: Workers transition from implementing franchise extraction to democratic coordination
    Given workers were required to enforce franchise policies regardless of harm
    And implementation of extraction created moral injury and worker resentment
    When democratic governance replaces franchise control
    Then workers coordinate operations based on collective wisdom, not corporate mandates
    And schedule flexibility serves workers' family needs, not corporate efficiency demands
    And customer service becomes genuine care, not scripted performance
    And workplace becomes site of flourishing, not extraction enforcement
    And workplace_elohim supports workers' growing democratic governance capacity
