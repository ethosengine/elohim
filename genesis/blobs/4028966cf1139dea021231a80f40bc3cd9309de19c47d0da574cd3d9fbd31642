Scenario: Examine cohort effects comparing early vs late adopters
    Given communities adopted protocol at different times across decade
    When James compares adoption cohorts
    Then he finds early adopters benefit from learning community support
    And he discovers later adopters benefit from improved protocol versions
    And he identifies that community context matters more than timing
    And cohort analysis illuminates adoption dynamics
