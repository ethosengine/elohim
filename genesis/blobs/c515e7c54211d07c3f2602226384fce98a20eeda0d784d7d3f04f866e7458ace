Scenario: Learning across contexts builds coherent knowledge
    Given Jasmine learns in school, at work, in family, and in community
    And knowledge fragments across contexts
    When her personal_agent integrates learning from all contexts
    Then she should see connections: "Your work customer service builds communication skills valuable in all contexts"
    And understand how different learning experiences reinforce each other
    And develop coherent knowledge rather than fragmented skills
    And learn to translate capabilities across contexts
    And build sophisticated understanding through integrated experience
    And maintain coherent identity while navigating multiple learning environments
