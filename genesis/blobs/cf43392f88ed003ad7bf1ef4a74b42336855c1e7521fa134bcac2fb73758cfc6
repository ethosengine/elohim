Scenario: Journalist investigates charter school performance claims
    Given charter schools claim superior outcomes for disadvantaged students
    And receive public funding based on performance claims
    When the Observer analyzes charter outcomes versus district schools
    Then the journalist sees charters are more racially segregated
    And finds test gains disappear when controlling for selective enrollment
    And documents higher suspension rates for students of color
    And shows charter expansion drains resources from district
    And publishes investigation questioning charter expansion policy
