Scenario: Teen understands worker rights and labor protections
    Given Jasmine is entitled to labor protections as a worker
    And many young workers don't know their rights
    When workplace_elohim provides education about worker rights
    Then it should teach her about minimum wage, overtime, breaks, and safety regulations
    And explain youth-specific labor protections
    And inform her about right to organize and collective bargaining
    And provide resources about reporting labor violations
    And help her understand that worker rights exist to prevent exploitation
    And build her expectation that labor deserves legal protection
