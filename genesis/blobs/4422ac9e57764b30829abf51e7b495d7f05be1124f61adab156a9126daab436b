Scenario: Customer becomes community investor supporting democratic conversions
    Given Ms. Johnson has modest savings wanting to support community values-aligned
    And community investment opportunities in democratic businesses exist
    When she learns neighbors invested in Maria's Kitchen conversion
    Then she considers investing in next democratic conversion (Rosa's Auto Repair)
    And investment would provide fair return (5% annually) plus social benefit
    And her capital would enable worker ownership and community wealth
    And customer role can expand to investor role if desired
    And community_elohim manages community investment accessible to customers
