Scenario: Former owner role evolves from command to facilitation
    Given Rosa was sole decision-maker carrying full responsibility
    And transition steward role requires fundamentally different skills
    When Rosa begins facilitating rather than commanding
    Then her proposals become suggestions workers can accept or modify
    And her expertise is valued through consultation, not authority
    And conflicts are resolved through democratic process, not owner decree
    And workers request her input because it's helpful, not because it's mandated
    And workplace_elohim ensures boundaries prevent hierarchical creep
