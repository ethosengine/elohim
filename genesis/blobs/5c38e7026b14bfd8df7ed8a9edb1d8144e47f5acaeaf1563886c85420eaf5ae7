Scenario: Seasonal supply coordination enables year-round democratic food service
    Given individual farms have limited seasonal production windows
    And restaurants need year-round supply but faced corporate distribution dependence
    When democratic farms coordinate across climate zones and seasons
    Then network provides diverse year-round supply through farmer coordination
    And restaurants adapt menus to seasonal availability reducing waste
    And farmers specialize in crops suited to their land and climate
    And seasonal coordination provides reliability without standardization
