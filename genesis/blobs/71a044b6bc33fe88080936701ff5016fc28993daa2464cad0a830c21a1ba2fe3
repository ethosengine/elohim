Scenario: Neighborhood collective action on shared concerns
    Given neighborhood faces shared challenges
    And individual action is less effective than collective action
    And Robert has leadership capacity from professional experience
    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates collective action
    Then it should facilitate neighborhood organizing around shared concerns
    And recognize Robert's leadership capabilities
    And help coordinate neighborhood improvement projects
    And surface opportunities for collective action
    And build neighborhood governance capacity
    And demonstrate that care for place is part of care economy
    And strengthen neighborhood through collaborative problem-solving
