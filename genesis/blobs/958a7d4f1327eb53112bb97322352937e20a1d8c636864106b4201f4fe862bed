# Intents and Commitments: From Desire to Promise

## The Planning Layer

hREA distinguishes between three temporal states:
1. **Intent**: What might happen (desired/offered)
2. **Commitment**: What will happen (promised)
3. **Economic Event**: What did happen (observed)

This enables coordination before action.

## Intents: Offers and Requests

An Intent is a planned economic flow that hasn't been committed to yet.

**As an Offer** (provider specified):
```
Intent: "I can provide 10 hours of tutoring per week"
├── provider: tutor_amara
├── receiver: (unspecified - open offer)
├── action: work
├── effortQuantity: 10 hours/week
└── resourceConformsTo: tutoring-service
```

**As a Request** (receiver specified):
```
Intent: "We need someone to repair our community laptops"
├── provider: (unspecified - seeking provider)
├── receiver: community_center
├── action: work
├── resourceConformsTo: electronics-repair
└── note: "15 laptops needing maintenance"
```

## Commitments: Promises Made

When agents agree, intents become commitments:

```
Commitment: Tutoring Agreement
├── provider: tutor_amara
├── receiver: student_emeka
├── action: work
├── effortQuantity: 2 hours/week
├── hasBeginning: 2024-12-01
├── satisfies: [intent_tutoring_request]
└── agreedIn: learning-circle-agreement
```

Commitments are **promises** that can be:
- **Fulfilled** by economic events
- **Tracked** for accountability
- **Connected** to agreements

## Coordination Without Central Control

This intent/commitment pattern enables:
- **Matching**: Offers find requests automatically
- **Negotiation**: Agents adjust until agreement
- **Accountability**: Commitments can be tracked
- **Trust**: Fulfillment history builds reputation

No central authority needed - just agents making and keeping promises.
