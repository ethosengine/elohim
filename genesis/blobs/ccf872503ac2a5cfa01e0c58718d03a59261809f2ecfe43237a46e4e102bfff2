Scenario: Preventing workplace retaliation for accommodation requests
    Given employers sometimes retaliate against workers who request accommodations
    And retaliation can be subtle (worse assignments, social exclusion, negative evaluations)
    When Alex requests accommodations or asserts rights
    Then the workplace_elohim should monitor for retaliation patterns
    And it should document timeline of accommodation requests and subsequent treatment changes
    And it should help Alex identify legally actionable retaliation
    And Alex should be connected to legal resources if retaliation occurs
    And the protocol should protect Alex from employer retaliation systematically
    And documentation should support legal claims if necessary
    And Alex should feel supported in asserting rights without fear
