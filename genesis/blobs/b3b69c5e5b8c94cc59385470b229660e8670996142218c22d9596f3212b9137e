Feature: Education Policy Parent Advocacy
  As a parent in the public_observer system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to engage with education policy and school board decisions
  So that my children's education serves their learning not bureaucratic convenience

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user is registered in the system
    And the parent has linked their children's schools and grade levels
    And the educational governance context is active

  Scenario: Parent translates education-ese to real child impacts
    Given the school board discusses "instructional efficiency optimization"
    And the parent reviews meeting while child does homework
    When the Observer translates the education jargon
    Then the parent learns this means eliminating teaching assistants
    And understands impact is class size increases from 24 to 32 students
    And sees real effect on their child's individual attention
    And can respond to actual impacts vs bureaucratic language
    And education policy becomes accessible to working parents

  Scenario: Parent participates in 15 minutes not 3 hours
    Given the school board meets Tuesday at 7 PM for 3+ hours
    And the parent has work shift, dinner, and bedtime routines
    When the parent cannot attend the meeting in person
    Then they receive 3-minute morning summary of decisions
    And can submit questions and positions via mobile app
    And get alert if their child's school is specifically affected
    And review post-meeting summary with action items
    And democracy fits into parent's actual available time

  Scenario: Parent discovers teacher coalition on class size
    Given the board proposes increasing class sizes to save money
    And the parent opposes this for their child's learning
    When the Observer shows teacher union position on class sizes
    Then the parent sees teachers oppose increase for same reasons
    And understands research on class size impacts on learning
    And natural parent-teacher alliance against harmful policy becomes visible
    And coordinated parent-teacher testimony defeats the proposal
    And board cannot divide parents and teachers

  Scenario: Parent tracks curriculum policy transparency
    Given the school board discusses curriculum changes
    And the parent wants to understand what their child will learn
    When the parent reviews Observer's curriculum analysis
    Then they see specific content being added or removed
    And understand pedagogical approaches and their evidence base
    And view teacher professional perspectives on the curriculum
    And can evaluate changes based on child's learning needs
    And curriculum decisions include parent informed input

  Scenario: Parent challenges harmful discipline policies
    Given the school implements zero-tolerance discipline policy
    And the parent's child has been suspended for minor incident
    When the parent reviews Observer's discipline data
    Then they see suspension rates and disparate racial impacts
    And learn about restorative justice alternatives
    And discover other parents whose children face similar treatment
    And understand policy alternatives from other districts
    And parent coalition advocates for evidence-based discipline reform

  Scenario: Parent exposes school resource inequities
    Given the parent suspects their child's school gets fewer resources
    And neighboring school seems to have more programs and facilities
    When the parent reviews Observer's district equity analysis
    Then they see per-student spending varies by thousands of dollars
    And westside schools have gifted programs and experienced teachers
    And their child's school lacks arts, music, and advanced courses
    And systematic inequity pattern becomes documented evidence
    And parent advocacy shifts to structural equity demands

  Scenario: Parent evaluates school board candidate positions
    Given school board election is approaching
    And three candidates claim to "support children and families"
    When the parent reviews Observer's candidate comparison
    Then they see each candidate's voting record on key issues
    And understand positions on class sizes, teacher pay, program funding
    And view candidates' funding sources and potential conflicts
    And can make informed vote in 15 minutes during lunch break
    And parent participation strengthens education democracy

  Scenario: Parent coordinates opposition to program cuts
    Given the board proposes eliminating elementary music programs
    And the parent's child participates in school band
    When the Observer connects parents across district whose children affected
    Then 230 families from 8 schools form coordinated coalition
    And present unified testimony on music education benefits
    And propose alternative budget cuts that preserve student programs
    And district-wide parent power prevents program elimination
    And children's enrichment programs are preserved

  Scenario: Parent challenges state funding formula
    Given the parent learns state funding shortchanges their district
    And wonders why their child's school lacks basic resources
    When the parent reviews Observer's state funding analysis
    Then they see their district receives $3,000 less per student
    And understand state formula creates massive inequities
    And learn this explains overcrowded classes and cut programs
    And connect with parents in other underfunded districts statewide
    And parent advocacy expands to state-level funding reform

  Scenario: Parent tracks special education compliance
    Given the parent's child has IEP for learning disability
    And required support services aren't being provided
    When the parent reviews Observer's special education tracking
    Then they see federal law mandates these services
    And understand district is violating child's legal rights
    And learn process for filing compliance complaint
    And connect with other special education parents
    And district cannot quietly violate disability rights

  Scenario: Parent advocates for school safety investments
    Given the parent worries about school safety and emergency preparedness
    And board discusses "safety measures" in vague terms
    When the parent reviews Observer's safety policy analysis
    Then they see which safety measures are evidence-based vs security theater
    And understand budget allocations for counselors vs surveillance
    And learn about trauma-informed approaches to school safety
    And can advocate for measures that actually protect children
    And school safety policy centers student wellbeing not punishment

  Scenario: Parent opposes standardized testing overload
    Given the parent's child faces excessive standardized testing
    And tests create stress without improving learning
    When the parent reviews Observer's testing policy context
    Then they see how many instructional days lost to testing
    And understand which tests are federally required vs optional
    And learn about opt-out policies and parent rights
    And discover other parents concerned about testing burden
    And parent coalition advocates for reducing unnecessary testing

  Scenario: Parent tracks board accountability for promises
    Given the school board promised to address transportation by Q2
    And the parent's child still has unreliable dangerous bus service
    When three months pass without action on the commitment
    Then the Observer alerts parent about broken promise
    And provides exact quote from February board meeting
    And shows which board members made the commitment
    And parent raises specific accountability question publicly
    And board commitments to families persist despite turnover
