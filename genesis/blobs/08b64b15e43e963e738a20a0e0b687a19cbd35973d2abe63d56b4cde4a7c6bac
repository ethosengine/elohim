Scenario: Board member evaluates achievement gap despite test score improvements
    Given superintendent presents improving test scores as evidence of success
    And board wants to understand if all students are benefiting from improvements
    And media reports question equity of district's progress
    When the board member uses Observer educational equity analysis
    Then they receive achievement data disaggregated by race, income, and language
    And see average scores improved but gaps between groups widened
    And access analysis showing advanced course access concentrated in affluent schools
    And discover resource distribution favoring already-high-performing schools
    And equity analysis reveals which students are and aren't being served well
