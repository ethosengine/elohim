Scenario: Local supply relationships strengthen through democratic coordination
    Given Rosa bought some supplies from neighborhood vendors
    And democratic network can deepen local sourcing commitments
    When workplace and community governance prioritize local procurement
    Then auto shop sources more supplies from neighborhood businesses
    And EAE network coordination provides volume purchasing to local vendors
    And supplier relationships become mutual support, not just transactions
    And supply chain transparency shows community members how money circulates locally
    And community_elohim coordinates supply chain for maximum local benefit
