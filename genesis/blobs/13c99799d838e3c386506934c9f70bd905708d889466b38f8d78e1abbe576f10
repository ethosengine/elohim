Scenario: Managing fixed retirement income while providing care
    Given Margaret lives on retirement income that cannot be increased
    And grandparenting sometimes involves expenses (activities, treats, supplies)
    When Margaret's personal_agent tracks spending related to grandchildren
    Then it should help her budget for grandparenting costs
    And it should identify when care provision creates financial burden
    And it should suggest discussions with family about cost-sharing
    And it should help Margaret maintain dignity while managing constraints
    And the system should prevent financial exploitation of grandparents
    And Margaret should be able to provide care without financial hardship
