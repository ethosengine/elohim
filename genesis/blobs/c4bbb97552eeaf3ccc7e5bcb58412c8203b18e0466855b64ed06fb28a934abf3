# Preteen - Value Scanner

## Archetype

Marcus is 12 years old and shops for his family's weekly groceries largely on his own. His mother works two jobs; his father isn't in the picture. Marcus uses the Value Scanner to manage a $75 weekly budget, coordinating meals for himself and his 7-year-old sister Keisha. His personal_agent helps him track nutrition across the week, identify sales, and ensure Keisha's dietary needs are met. At checkout, Marcus receives care tokens reflecting his substantial household contribution—tokens his family uses to access community resources. He's not playing at responsibility; he's living it.

Marcus represents the Real Responsibility phase (ages 11-13) of the Value Scanner epic. Unlike younger children learning through bounded autonomy, Marcus makes decisions with direct impact on his family's survival. The Value Scanner helps him carry a burden that would be overwhelming alone: feeding a household on limited resources while ensuring nutrition and managing preferences. His $75/week isn't hypothetical—it's what his family has. The protocol makes his care labor visible and valuable, channeling community support to recognize his contributions.

What distinguishes Marcus from both younger children and teens is this specific developmental moment: old enough for real responsibility, young enough to need scaffolding. He's developing abstract thinking and can plan across time (weekly meal planning, budgeting ahead). He's morally maturing, understanding fairness and reciprocity. The Value Scanner serves him by making complex resource management tractable while recognizing the magnitude of his care work. He's not just learning value literacy—he's practicing advanced stewardship under real constraint.

## Core Needs

- **Managing Real Scarcity with Dignity**: Marcus needs tools that help him navigate real resource constraints without shame. $75/week for two people requires careful planning. His personal_agent helps him identify sales, compare unit prices, plan meals that stretch ingredients, and find nutrition in affordable foods—but never in ways that feel patronizing. The care economy framework recognizes that his household labor is valuable even when he's resource-constrained. His care tokens acknowledge that feeding his family on limited resources takes skill and dedication.

- **Recognition for Substantial Care Labor**: Marcus needs the adult world to see that he's performing work that would be valued if an adult did it. He's doing meal planning, grocery shopping, budgeting, nutrition management, and care coordination—skills that professional household managers get paid for. The Value Scanner makes this labor visible. His care token accumulation reflects real economic value. When community resources become available (scholarships, support programs, opportunities), his demonstrated stewardship is evidence of his capability and contribution.

- **Planning Tools for Complex Coordination**: Marcus needs capability-appropriate tools for managing across time and context. He's planning weekly meals, coordinating Keisha's school lunch needs with dinner ingredients, managing inventory, tracking sales across stores. His personal_agent provides genuine decision support: nutritional analysis across meals, budget projection, shopping list optimization, reminder systems. This isn't helicopter parenting—it's appropriate scaffolding for complex adult work being done by a 12-year-old.

- **Connection to Support Networks**: Marcus needs the Value Scanner to connect him to community resources without stigma. His care contributions qualify his family for community support (food cooperatives, mutual aid networks, care economy resources). The protocol connects needs to resources through care economy principles: Marcus isn't receiving charity because he's poor; he's participating in reciprocal care networks where his contributions (feeding his sister, managing household resources) are recognized as valuable. The community_elohim helps coordinate support while preserving his dignity.

- **Developmentally Appropriate Autonomy**: Marcus needs freedom to make real decisions within a safety net. He's largely independent in shopping, but the protocol catches dangerous situations (nutrition falling below thresholds, budget crisis, household stress indicators). His personal_agent knows when to surface concerns to trusted adults (teachers, extended family, community resources) without undermining his autonomy. He's learning self-reliance while being protected from overwhelming burden.

## Key Relationships

**To Siblings**: Marcus's relationship with Keisha is care-provider, not just sibling. The Value Scanner helps him track her nutritional needs, food preferences, allergies, and developing tastes. When he chooses foods she likes while staying on budget, his care work is recognized. The protocol helps prevent parentification damage—Keisha also sees Marcus's care contributions, learning to appreciate rather than take for granted his work. Their relationship is mediated by family_elohim that tries to preserve sibling dynamics while acknowledging care realities.

**To Parent**: Marcus's mother is stretched thin across two jobs. The Value Scanner helps Marcus take real responsibility while keeping her informed. She sees his care contributions, his budget management, his meal planning—allowing her to trust him while maintaining oversight. The family_elohim helps her calibrate autonomy levels appropriately. When Marcus needs help, she's alerted. When he's succeeding, she's prompted to recognize his work. The protocol is preventing household stress from breaking family bonds by making care visible and manageable.

**To Personal Agent**: Marcus's relationship with his personal_agent is almost collegial—he's using it as a real tool for real work. The agent provides information, analysis, planning support, and emotional encouragement. It might say, "You've kept nutrition above 90% of recommended levels for three weeks—that's excellent stewardship." The agent serves his capability development while watching for signs of overwhelming stress. It's learning to recognize when Marcus needs adult intervention vs. when he needs space to solve problems independently.

**To Community Resources**: Marcus interacts with community_elohim through resource coordination. His care contributions make his family eligible for community support—food cooperatives, after-school programs for Keisha, educational opportunities. These interactions are structured by care economy principles: reciprocity, not charity. Marcus gives care (household management, sister-care); community gives care (food access, educational support). The protocol coordinates these exchanges while protecting his privacy and dignity.

**To Store Workers and Food Systems**: Marcus is beginning to understand food systems complexity. His personal_agent might surface information about where food comes from, who grows it, what care labor is embedded. He's learning that his budget constraints connect to larger economic structures—farm labor, distribution systems, retail markup. This awareness could fuel later civic engagement around food justice, but for now it builds empathy and understanding that care economy extends beyond his household.

## Relevant Governance Layers

### Geographic/Political

**Individual Layer**
Marcus exercises substantial autonomy—making economic decisions, planning across time, managing resources, coordinating care. His values are consciously forming. He's developing identity as a capable person who takes care of his family. The protocol protects his individual dignity while acknowledging his contributions. His personal_agent serves his self-governance capacity without trying to control his development.

**Family Layer**
Marcus operates as a junior partner in family governance, not just a dependent. He makes real decisions about family resources. His mother maintains ultimate authority but increasingly trusts his judgment. Family care tokens recognize his contributions as substantial, not symbolic. The family_elohim helps coordinate their partnership—alerting his mother when he needs support, prompting her to recognize his work, helping Marcus understand when to defer to her judgment.

**Neighborhood Layer**
Marcus's shopping patterns contribute to neighborhood-level insights about food access, pricing, and family needs. The neighborhood_elohim might surface opportunities: "A food cooperative is forming—your family's participation would strengthen it." Marcus is learning that neighborhood-scale coordination can reduce individual family burden. His care contributions benefit from and contribute to neighborhood care patterns.

**Community Layer**
Marcus engages community-level governance through resource access and care contribution. Community care networks recognize his household labor and channel support. He's learning that community exists to coordinate care across families—that his family's needs and contributions connect to broader patterns. The community_elohim helps him access resources while preserving dignity, framing everything through reciprocity and care economy principles.

### Functional

**Educational Layer**
Marcus's real-world care responsibilities connect to educational value. The Value Scanner could integrate with school (with permission) to recognize his applied learning in math, nutrition science, planning, and resource management. Educational institutions increasingly recognize that students like Marcus are developing sophisticated capabilities through household responsibility. His care contributions could qualify for academic recognition, scholarships, or alternative pathways that honor real-world capability.

**Ecological/Bioregional Layer**
Marcus is beginning to understand connections between his food choices and ecological systems. His personal_agent might help him choose locally grown produce when budget allows, understand seasonal availability, or recognize sustainable farming practices. He's learning that care economy includes care for ecological systems—that stewardship extends beyond his immediate household to the land and labor that feeds his family.

## Implementation Notes

- **Technical**: Interface needs sophisticated planning tools: meal planning with nutritional analysis, budget tracking across weeks, shopping list optimization, inventory management, multi-store price comparison. Personal_agent should provide adult-level decision support with age-appropriate interface. Crisis detection systems watch for nutrition deficits, budget shortfalls, or stress indicators requiring intervention. Data integration with community resources for seamless access without stigma.

- **Privacy**: Extremely sensitive—Marcus's household situation must be protected. His care contributions are visible to his family and (anonymized) to community resource coordinators, but his specific circumstances aren't broadcast. Community support should flow to him through care economy networks, not through means-tested charity that requires exposing private struggles. Data about his shopping patterns stays confidential unless he chooses to share.

- **Interface**: Design for competent young person managing complex adult work. Clean, efficient, information-rich. Comparison tools, planning tools, tracking tools—all professional-grade but accessible. Recognition of care contributions should feel genuine, not patronizing. Emergency assistance options clearly visible. Connection to community resources integrated seamlessly. Interface communicates respect for his capability and acknowledgment of his work.

- **Constraints**: Safety nets must be robust—if Marcus's budget becomes unsustainable, if nutrition falls below safe levels, if household stress exceeds healthy bounds, the protocol must connect him to adult support. But intervention should preserve his autonomy and dignity. The goal is supporting his capability, not taking over his responsibilities or shaming his family's circumstances.

- **Opportunities**: Marcus represents millions of young people carrying real household responsibility, usually invisibly. The Value Scanner can make their care labor visible, channel community support appropriately, recognize their capabilities, and prevent the isolation and stress that often accompanies youthful caregiving. If the protocol serves Marcus well, it demonstrates that care economy can support vulnerable populations with dignity—that making care visible creates pathways for appropriate support that strengthen rather than undermine capability and autonomy.
