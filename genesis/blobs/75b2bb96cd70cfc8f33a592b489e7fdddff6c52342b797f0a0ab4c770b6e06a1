Scenario: Participating in Protocol Research Council review
    Given I serve 6-month rotating term on Protocol Research Council
    And developers propose Agent Protocol v2.3.7 update
    When I evaluate proposed update before deployment
    Then I assess: whether update solves claimed problem
    And I check: for new vulnerabilities introduced
    And I verify: constitutional alignment is maintained
    And I test: adversarial robustness
    And I collaborate: with other experts on review
    And I recommend: approval, rejection, or modification
    And updates require: expert approval before Constitutional Council authorization
