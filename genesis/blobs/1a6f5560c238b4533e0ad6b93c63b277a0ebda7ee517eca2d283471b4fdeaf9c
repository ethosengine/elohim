Scenario: Corporate-mandated operational procedures are evaluated and selectively preserved
    Given franchise required standardized procedures (some useful, others extractive)
    And workers had no voice in which procedures served quality vs. extraction
    When democratic governance reviews all franchise operational requirements
    Then health and safety protocols are preserved and improved
    And useful training structures are kept while eliminating degrading aspects
    And extractive mechanisms (bathroom time limits, speedup metrics) are eliminated
    And workers decide democratically which standards serve quality and dignity
    And workplace_elohim documents procedural changes and rationale
