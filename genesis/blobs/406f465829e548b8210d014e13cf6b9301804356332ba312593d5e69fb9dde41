Scenario: Emergency contact procedures recognize single parents have no immediate backup
    Given Maria is the only parent available for children's emergencies
    And she may be unreachable due to work constraints
    When schools need emergency parent contact
    Then the educational_elohim should help Maria establish backup emergency contacts
    And schools should understand single parents may not be immediately available
    And emergency protocols should include extended family or neighbor backups
    And schools should work with Maria's realistic availability constraints
    And children's emergency needs should be met even when solo parent is unavailable
