Scenario: Elderly person maintains choice authority despite assistance needs
    Given Helen's daughter assists with weekly shopping
    And Helen requires help but retains decision-making capacity
    When Helen uses the Value Scanner with assistance
    Then she should still choose which foods she prefers
    And her daughter should facilitate, not decide for her
    And the personal_agent should say "Helen, which apples do you want?"
    And Helen's preferences should be respected and recorded
    And assistance should enhance her autonomy, not diminish it
    And her dignity as decision-maker should be preserved
    And the system should distinguish between needing help and losing authority
