Scenario: Acknowledging uncertainty in technical analysis
    Given appellant questions agent's 85% confidence in suicide risk pattern
    And council asks if the confidence level is reliable
    When I provide honest uncertainty assessment
    Then I explain: we don't have validated ground truth for this prediction type
    And I acknowledge: the 85% might be overconfident or underconfident
    And I clarify: what we know and what we don't know
    And I avoid: hiding behind expert authority to eliminate uncertainty
    And I enable: council to make decision under acknowledged uncertainty
    And I demonstrate: that honesty about limits builds trust
    And citizens know: when they're governing despite deep uncertainty
