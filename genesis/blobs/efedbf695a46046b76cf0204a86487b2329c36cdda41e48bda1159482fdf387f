Scenario: Connection to place through decades of residence
    Given Helen has lived in same bioregion for 82 years
    And deep place-based knowledge develops over lifetime
    When bioregional governance makes land use decisions
    Then Helen's intimate knowledge of place should inform planning
    And longtime residents should have standing in ecological governance
    And her connection to land should be valued in decision-making
    And the protocol should elevate voices of those with deep place-knowledge
    And bioregional stewardship should prioritize those who've observed place over time
    And Helen's decades of residence should give her ecological authority
    And land use should consider those who remember land's history
