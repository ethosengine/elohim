Scenario: Studying national crisis response and protocol resilience
    Given nation experienced major crisis (pandemic, economic collapse, climate disaster)
    And protocol governance was tested under extreme conditions
    When I analyze how protocol functioned during and after crisis
    Then I examine: whether emergency coordination maintained democratic oversight
    And I assess: whether crisis pressures led to authoritarian drift
    And I measure: community resilience with protocol vs without
    And I explore: how Constitutional Councils balanced urgency with deliberation
    And I identify: protocol vulnerabilities revealed under stress
    And I analyze: recovery trajectories and institutional learning
    And My research reveals: whether democratic AI governance is resilient or fragile
