Scenario: Ecological care tokens recognize environmental contribution despite poverty
    Given Maria's household practices are environmentally exemplary
    And she achieves low impact through necessity, not affluent environmentalism
    When ecological care tokens are calculated
    Then her resource efficiency should be valued as environmental contribution
    And she should accumulate ecological care tokens for sustainable practices
    And low-impact living should be recognized regardless of economic motivation
    And environmental stewardship should be valued whether chosen or necessary
    And Maria should receive ecological recognition for her sustainable household
