Scenario: Owner achieves fair compensation for years of sweat equity
    Given Rosa built business through 15 years of underpaid 60-hour weeks
    And business is worth $200K but no ethical buyer exists
    When EAE offers $180K acquisition
    Then Rosa receives payment reflecting equipment value, customer base, and sweat equity
    And payment comes from community investment pool, not worker exploitation
    And Rosa can pay debts, fund retirement, achieve financial breathing room
    And fair value is recognized without requiring community institution destruction
