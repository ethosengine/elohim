Scenario: Community oversight ensures environmental stewardship and sustainability
    Given private ownership may prioritize short-term profit over environmental health
    And community bears environmental impacts of farming practices
    When community has governance voice in farm environmental practices
    Then sustainable and regenerative agriculture is prioritized through community input
    And environmental practices are transparent and accountable to community
    And water quality, soil health, and biodiversity are protected as community values
    And farm environmental stewardship benefits entire community ecosystem
    And community_elohim monitors environmental practices and community accountability
