Scenario: Privacy boundaries in shared living space
    Given Kenji shares space but deserves privacy
    And household coordination requires some information sharing
    When the household_elohim manages household data
    Then it should share only household-relevant information with roommates
    And Kenji's personal data should remain private
    And roommates should see his cooking contributions, not his financial struggles
    And privacy boundaries should be clear and respected
    And the system should balance coordination needs with personal privacy
    And Kenji should control what household information is shared
