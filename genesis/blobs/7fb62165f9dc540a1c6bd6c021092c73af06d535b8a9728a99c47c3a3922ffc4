Scenario: Equitable labor distribution negotiated with care economy data
    Given Sarah feels she's doing more than her fair share
    And her partner may not see the full scope of her labor
    When they discuss household labor distribution
    Then the household_elohim should provide specific contribution data
    And Sarah's invisible labor should be quantified explicitly
    And both partners should see objective assessment
    And negotiations should be based on facts, not perceptions
    And equitable arrangements should be reachable through visibility
