Scenario: Participating in national technical standards development
    Given national protocol standards need technical specification
    And I serve on standards development committee
    When I help craft technical requirements
    Then I ensure: standards serve constitutional principles
    And I verify: specifications are implementable
    And I check: for security vulnerabilities in standards
    And I collaborate: with diverse technical experts
    And I submit: standards to National Constitutional Council for approval
    And I demonstrate: technical development serving democratic governance
    And citizens authorize: technical changes through council oversight
