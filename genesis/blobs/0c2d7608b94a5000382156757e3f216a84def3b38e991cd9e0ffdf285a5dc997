Scenario: Customer experiences transparency about where money goes
    Given corporate spending is opaque—customers don't know how their payment distributes
    And Ms. Johnson cares about supporting fair wages but had no information
    When democratic business provides complete value distribution transparency
    Then she sees exactly: 60% to worker wages and benefits, 30% to community programs, 10% to sustainability
    And workers earn $18/hour minimum vs. previous corporate $11/hour
    And her $8.99 meal supports specific visible outcomes
    And transparency enables ethical consumption through informed choice
    And community_elohim provides accessible transparency dashboard for interested customers
