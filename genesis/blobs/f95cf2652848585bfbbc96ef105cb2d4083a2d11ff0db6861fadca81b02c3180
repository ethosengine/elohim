Scenario: Manager transitions operational knowledge to worker collective over time
    Given Marcus holds tacit knowledge from years of operations management
    And democratic model requires distributing this knowledge to workers
    When knowledge transfer process begins
    Then Marcus documents operational procedures and decision frameworks
    And Marcus trains workers in business operations through structured learning
    And workers gradually take on tasks previously Marcus's sole domain
    And after 18 months, workers govern operations with Marcus in purely advisory role
    And workplace_elohim tracks knowledge distribution preventing re-concentration
