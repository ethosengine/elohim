Scenario: Parent decodes district resource allocation decisions
    Given the school board discusses "optimizing resource distribution"
    And the parent cannot attend the 3-hour Tuesday evening meeting
    When the parent reviews Observer's translated summary
    Then they learn this means cutting 12 teaching positions
    And see this increases their child's class size from 24 to 32 students
    And understand real impact on their child's learning
    And can submit informed opposition via app in 10 minutes
    And bureaucratic language doesn't hide impacts from working parents
