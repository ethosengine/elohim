Scenario: Parent challenges development affecting school capacity
    Given a developer proposes 300-unit residential development
    And claims it will "strengthen the community and tax base"
    When the parent reviews Observer's school capacity analysis
    Then they see 180 new students projected from the development
    And learn the nearest elementary school is already over capacity
    And understand no new school facilities are planned
    And view developer's track record on past school impact promises
    And can challenge development approval with child-impact data
