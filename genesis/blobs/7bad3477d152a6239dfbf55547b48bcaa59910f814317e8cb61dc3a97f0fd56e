Scenario: Surveillance transforms from extraction to protection
    Given workplace cameras previously monitored workers for corporate benefit
    And cameras now operate as witness infrastructure under worker control
    When a customer harasses Maria during her shift
    And the incident is captured on camera
    Then the footage is immediately available to Maria
    And Maria can democratically propose banning the customer
    And management cannot delete or modify the footage
    And the footage cannot be used for speedup or discipline without worker consent
    And Maria's dignity is architecturally protected
