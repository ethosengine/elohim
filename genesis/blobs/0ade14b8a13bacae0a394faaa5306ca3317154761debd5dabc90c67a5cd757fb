Scenario: Participating in UN discussions on AI governance standards
    Given United Nations addresses global AI governance
    And standards will affect billions of people
    When I represent my nation in UN deliberations
    Then I share: experience with protocol in my country
    And I advocate: for constitutional minimums as global standard
    And I present: evidence about sortition governance effectiveness
    And I promote: transparency and recourse as universal requirements
    And I resist: standards that advantage authoritarian control
    And I support: interoperability enabling coordination
    And I work: toward global framework respecting diversity
