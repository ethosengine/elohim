Scenario: Developer school impact fees gain accountability
    Given a developer paid $1.2M in school impact fees
    And fees were supposed to address enrollment impacts
    When the Observer tracks how district used impact fees
    Then analysis shows: fees went to general operations not capacity expansion
    And school still lacks capacity to serve development's students
    And impact fee mechanism failed to actually mitigate impacts
    And accountability creates pressure for effective mitigation requirements
    And communities demand better school impact policy
