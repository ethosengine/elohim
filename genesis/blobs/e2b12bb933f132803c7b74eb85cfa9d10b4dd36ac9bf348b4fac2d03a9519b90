Feature: Climate Displacement and Bioregional Coordination
  As a displaced_person in the social_medium system
  Operating at the ecological_bioregional governance layer
  I want to maintain community cohesion despite climate displacement
  So that my community can support each other and coordinate across distance

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the displaced_person user is registered in the system
    And the ecological_bioregional governance context is active
    And the displaced person is part of a coastal community displaced by sea level rise

  Scenario: Climate-displaced community maintains cohesion across distance
    Given a coastal town is gradually becoming uninhabitable due to flooding
    And families are relocating to various inland communities over several years
    When displaced community members use Elohim to stay connected
    And they create a diaspora community space for their town
    Then families scattered across multiple cities maintain relationships
    And community memory and culture are preserved
    And mutual aid flows between dispersed community members
    And collective decision-making continues about remaining community assets
    And the community maintains identity despite geographic dispersal

  Scenario: Displaced community coordinates with climate adaptation network
    Given multiple coastal communities face similar climate displacement
    When they form a climate displacement affinity network
    And they share strategies for community preservation
    Then communities learn from each other's experiences
    And successful resettlement patterns are documented and shared
    And coordinated advocacy for climate displacement support emerges
    And the network coordinates with climate justice activists
    And systemic support for climate migrants is organized

  Scenario: Elder preserves bioregional knowledge across displacement
    Given community elders hold traditional knowledge of coastal ecology
    And this knowledge is being lost as the community displaces
    When elders document traditional knowledge through the network
    And younger displaced community members learn and preserve it
    Then bioregional ecological knowledge is preserved
    And the knowledge can inform restoration efforts
    And future generations maintain connection to ancestral place
    And cultural-ecological wisdom survives displacement

  Scenario: Displaced community coordinates managed retreat
    Given the coastal community is planning managed retreat over 10 years
    When the community uses Elohim to coordinate the transition
    And they make collective decisions about timing and destination
    Then families can coordinate moves to stay near each other
    And community assets are managed collectively during transition
    And mutual aid supports families through the displacement
    And the community maintains agency and cohesion through the crisis
    And managed retreat happens with dignity rather than chaos
