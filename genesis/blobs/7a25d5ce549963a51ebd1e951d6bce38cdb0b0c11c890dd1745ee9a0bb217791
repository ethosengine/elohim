Scenario: Advising on global crisis governance maintaining democracy
    Given planetary emergencies require rapid coordination
    And delegates establish crisis governance framework
    When I explain technical requirements for emergency response
    Then I clarify: what's technically possible under urgency
    And I explore: how to maintain verification under time pressure
    And I assess: risks of emergency powers being exploited
    And I present: technical safeguards for crisis protocols
    And I balance: speed with democratic accountability
    And I enable: delegates to design crisis governance wisely
    And I serve: resilient democracy through technical design
