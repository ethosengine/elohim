Scenario: Local food systems supported through care economy purchases
    Given Sarah's bioregion has local food producers
    And supporting local agriculture has environmental and community benefits
    When Sarah makes food purchasing decisions
    Then the bioregional_elohim should highlight local options
    And it should show environmental benefits of local food
    And it should facilitate connections to local producers
    And Sarah's purchases should support bioregional food security
    And care economy should strengthen local food systems
