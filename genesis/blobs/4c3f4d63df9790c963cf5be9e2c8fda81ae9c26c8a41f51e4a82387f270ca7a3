Scenario: Managing self-care with unpredictable work schedule
    Given my work schedule changes weekly with different shift patterns
    And I need to maintain basic nutrition and rest
    When my personal_agent detects schedule changes
    Then it should adapt my meal planning to available time slots
    And suggest efficient meal prep strategies for my schedule
    And protect time blocks for essential self-care
    And remind me that my well-being matters despite work demands
