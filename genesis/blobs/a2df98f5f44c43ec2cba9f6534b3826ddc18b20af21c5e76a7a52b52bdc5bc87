Feature: Individual Dignity and Data Sovereignty for Worker
  As a worker in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want my personal dignity protected and my data sovereign
  So that I am valued as a person, not exploited as a resource

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the worker user is registered in the system
    And the individual governance context is active
    And surveillance infrastructure has been converted to witness infrastructure

  Scenario: Worker controls their own REA (Resource-Event-Agent) profile data
    Given Maria has worked at ChickenMax for 8 years
    And her REA profile documents her contributions across multiple dimensions
    When Maria requests to view her complete REA profile
    Then she sees her documented expertise (847 perfect fryer batches, 47 hours training given)
    And she sees her care work (comforting customers, mentoring colleagues)
    And she sees her efficiency improvements ($3,400 waste eliminated)
    And she controls what portions of her profile to share externally
    And she can export her profile if she changes jobs
    And no corporate entity can access her data without her consent

  Scenario: Surveillance transforms from extraction to protection
    Given workplace cameras previously monitored workers for corporate benefit
    And cameras now operate as witness infrastructure under worker control
    When a customer harasses Maria during her shift
    And the incident is captured on camera
    Then the footage is immediately available to Maria
    And Maria can democratically propose banning the customer
    And management cannot delete or modify the footage
    And the footage cannot be used for speedup or discipline without worker consent
    And Maria's dignity is architecturally protected

  Scenario: Fair compensation based on witnessed value creation
    Given Maria's 8 years of invisible contributions are now documented
    And her REA profile shows training, conflict prevention, and optimization work
    When the democratic workplace calculates compensation
    Then Maria receives $28/hour instead of previous $11/hour
    And her training contributions (47 hours) are compensated
    And her conflict resolution (12 incidents prevented) generates recognized value
    And her efficiency gains (2.3 hours daily saved) benefit her, not just corporate
    And transparent algorithms show exactly how her compensation is calculated

  Scenario: Worker receives immediate safety protection from harmful incidents
    Given DeShawn witnesses a safety violation in the kitchen
    When he uses his observer device to document the violation
    Then the workplace_elohim agent is immediately notified
    And appropriate safety protocols are activated
    And the incident is logged in the immutable safety record
    And DeShawn is protected from retaliation
    And management must address the violation democratically with worker input

  Scenario: Personal growth trajectory becomes visible and owned
    Given Emma has demonstrated supply chain optimization genius over 6 months
    And the REA system has documented her 23% waste reduction
    When Emma views her growth trajectory dashboard
    Then she sees her optimization pattern recognition abilities documented
    And she sees skill tokens accumulating toward higher roles
    And she discovers teaching opportunities based on her expertise
    And she can pursue cross-training based on witnessed interests
    And her development path is self-determined, not management-assigned

  Scenario: Worker exits with portable documented expertise
    Given Maria has accumulated 8 years of documented contributions
    And she decides to leave ChickenMax for another opportunity
    When she requests her portable REA profile
    Then she receives cryptographically signed documentation of her expertise
    And her profile includes training mastery, care work, and management skills
    And she can present this profile to prospective employers
    And her accumulated skill tokens remain valid across the EAE network
    And her ownership tokens are converted to fair value upon exit

  Scenario: Individual privacy is constitutionally protected while value is witnessed
    Given the Observer network documents workplace contributions
    And Emma prefers privacy about certain personal matters
    When Emma sets her privacy preferences
    Then work contributions are documented (with her consent)
    And personal conversations are not recorded or analyzed
    And bathroom breaks are not monitored for duration
    And her personal data (health, family, beliefs) remains sovereign
    And surveillance serves dignity protection, not corporate control

  Scenario: Worker experiences liberation from constant surveillance anxiety
    Given Maria previously worked under corporate cameras monitoring for "time theft"
    And she developed stress from constant surveillance
    When the workplace converts to democratic ownership
    And cameras become worker-controlled witness infrastructure
    Then Maria no longer fears being watched for compliance
    And she experiences reduced workplace anxiety and stress
    And her health indicators improve (lower blood pressure, better sleep)
    And her sense of dignity and autonomy increases measurably
