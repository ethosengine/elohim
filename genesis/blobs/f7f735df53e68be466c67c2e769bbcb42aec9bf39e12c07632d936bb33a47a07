Scenario: Municipal recognition of senior volunteer contributions
    Given Margaret volunteers extensively in municipal programs
    And her labor subsidizes municipal service provision
    When the municipality_elohim tracks volunteer contributions
    Then municipal government should see aggregate senior volunteer value
    And policy should reflect dependence on senior volunteer labor
    And seniors should be recognized as essential to municipal function
    And Margaret's contributions should give her standing in municipal affairs
    And volunteer labor should inform resource allocation
    And senior productivity should be visible to government
