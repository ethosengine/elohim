Scenario: Sector-wide environmental sustainability improves through democratic coordination
    Given franchise model externalizes environmental costs for profit maximization
    And individual locations lack power to demand sustainable supply chains
    When democratic network coordinates for environmental stewardship sector-wide
    Then local sourcing increases, reducing food miles and supporting regenerative agriculture
    And waste reduction practices spread through network sharing best practices
    And sustainable packaging becomes standard through coordinated purchasing
    And environmental accountability increases through democratic governance transparency
