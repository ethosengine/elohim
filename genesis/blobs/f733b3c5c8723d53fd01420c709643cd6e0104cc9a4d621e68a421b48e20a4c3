Scenario: Learning recognized as valuable work, not just credential pursuit
    Given Kenji spends 40+ hours per week on academic work
    And traditional economics treats student labor as non-productive
    When the educational_elohim tracks Kenji's educational work
    Then it should recognize studying as labor that creates value
    And it should accumulate care tokens for learning work
    And it should validate "You invested 45 hours in learning this week"
    And student intellectual labor should be valued, not invisible
    And the system should recognize education as work toward capability development
    And learning should be understood as care economy investment
