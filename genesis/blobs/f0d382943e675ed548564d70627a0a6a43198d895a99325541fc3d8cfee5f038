Scenario: Learning sustainable farming practices benefit everyone
    Given Marcus is developing systems thinking
    And agricultural practices affect long-term food security
    When Marcus learns about food production methods
    Then the personal_agent should explain sustainable vs. extractive farming
    And it should teach that care for soil creates long-term abundance
    And it should connect farm stewardship to household stewardship
    And he should understand that ecological care serves human flourishing
    And sustainable agriculture should be framed through care economy
    And his generation should expect farming that cares for land
