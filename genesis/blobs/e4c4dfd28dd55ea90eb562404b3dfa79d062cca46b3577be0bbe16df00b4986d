Scenario: Managing medical appointments with accessibility considerations
    Given medical facilities are often inaccessible
    And appointment logistics are complex with disability
    When Alex schedules medical appointments
    Then the personal_agent should help verify facility accessibility
    And it should coordinate transportation and support services
    And it should prepare accessibility information for providers in advance
    And it should track appointment schedules across multiple providers
    And logistics coordination should reduce Alex's burden
    And the protocol should make medical access less stressful
    And barriers should be identified and addressed proactively
