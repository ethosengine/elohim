Scenario: Protecting Alex from quality of life assumptions
    Given medical providers often make negative assumptions about disabled people's quality of life
    And these assumptions can lead to withheld or substandard care
    When providers discuss treatment options
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex challenge quality of life assumptions
    And it should assert that Alex's life is valuable and worth full treatment
    And it should document when providers suggest limiting care based on disability
    And Alex should receive same standard of care as non-disabled patients
    And the protocol should recognize that quality of life bias is discrimination
    And Alex's right to full medical care should be defended
    And assumptions about disability should never limit treatment options
