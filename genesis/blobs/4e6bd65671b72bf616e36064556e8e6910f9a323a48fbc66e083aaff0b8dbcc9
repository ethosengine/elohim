Scenario: Accessible interface accommodates aging-related needs without patronizing
    Given Margaret has age-related vision and dexterity changes
    And she is a competent adult with decades of nursing experience
    When Margaret uses the Value Scanner
    Then the interface should have large, high-contrast fonts
    And touch targets should be generous and forgiving
    And voice interface options should be available
    And navigation should be simple and consistent
    And the pace should be patient without being condescending
    And the tone should be respectful, never infantilizing
    And Margaret should feel empowered and capable
    And accessibility should enhance rather than diminish dignity
