Scenario: Privacy protection for young child's data
    Given Tommy's care contributions are being tracked
    And Tommy cannot consent to data sharing
    When Tommy's care data is recorded
    Then all data must stay encrypted on family devices
    And no behavioral profiling for commercial purposes should occur
    And no third-party access should be permitted
    And Tommy's wonder must never be monetized
    And parental controls must govern all data visibility
    And anonymization must occur before any community aggregation
