Scenario: Manager unlearns corporate extraction training through supported transition
    Given Marcus was trained by corporate to minimize labor costs and maximize productivity
    And these extraction skills are actively harmful in democratic context
    When he begins democratic coordinator role
    Then he receives training in facilitation, mediation, and collaborative coordination
    And workplace_elohim provides resources on horizontal organization practices
    And other democratic coordinators mentor him through transition
    And he unlearns surveillance instincts and command reflexes
    And his skill evolution is documented and supported, not demanded instantly
