Scenario: Customer benefits from community programs funded by value circulation
    Given corporate extraction left minimal resources for community benefit
    And Ms. Johnson and neighbors needed community support but lacked access
    When democratic value distribution funds community programs
    Then senior meal program provides affordable nutritious food and social connection
    And subsidized pricing (sliding scale) ensures access across income levels
    And community space is available for neighborhood organizing
    And her patronage directly supports programs benefiting her and neighbors
    And community_elohim manages community programs funded by democratic business
