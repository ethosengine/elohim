Scenario: Appeal reveals need for community-specific calibration
    Given I appeal a privacy threshold that feels too low for my community
    And multiple community members have filed similar appeals
    When Community Constitutional Council reviews the pattern
    Then they recognize this as community-wide concern not individual complaint
    And They recommend community-specific calibration of privacy thresholds
    And Community leader facilitates deliberation on local preferences
    And Community residents participate in calibrating the protocol
    And My appeal contributes to community self-governance
    And Local sovereignty is exercised within constitutional bounds
