Scenario: Community memory projects value elderly wisdom
    Given Helen holds decades of lived experience
    And community memory has cultural value
    When community memory projects are organized
    Then Helen should be invited to participate as valued contributor
    And her stories should be captured for community archive
    And her participation should be recognized as contribution
    And care tokens should reflect her memory-keeping work
    And the community_elohim should facilitate intergenerational knowledge transfer
    And the protocol should make visible that elders contribute to collective knowledge
    And community should benefit from elder wisdom
