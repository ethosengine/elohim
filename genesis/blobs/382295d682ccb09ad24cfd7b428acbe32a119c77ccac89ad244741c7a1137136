Scenario: Municipal governance evolution through protocol learning
    Given Riverside has three years implementing protocol
    And we have learned what works and what doesn't
    When I reflect on governance transformation
    Then I see: city council making better-informed decisions
    And I notice: residents more engaged through transparency
    And I observe: faster crisis response with better coordination
    And I acknowledge: challenges with accessibility and occasional controversy
    And I understand: protocol enhanced but didn't replace democratic governance
    And I know: community remains in control through sovereignty and calibration
    And I have become: leader facilitating partnership with AI not commanding it
