Scenario: Community opportunities surfaced based on teen's care patterns
    Given Jasmine has demonstrated leadership through her care contributions
    And the community is recruiting for youth advisory board
    When the community_elohim analyzes needs and capabilities
    Then it should surface the opportunity to Jasmine
    And explain why she's a good match: "Your care contributions demonstrate the leadership they're seeking"
    And connect her care work to civic opportunities
    And help her see pathways from care contribution to community leadership
    And demonstrate that care economy participation opens doors
    And recognize her capabilities rather than just her potential
