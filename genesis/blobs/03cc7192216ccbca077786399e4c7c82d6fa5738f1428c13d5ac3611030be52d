Feature: Household Layer Dignity-Preserving Care Coordination for Elderly
  As an elderly person living in my own home
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want to maintain my household with support while preserving my sense of home
  So that I remain in control of my own living space despite needing assistance

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elderly user "Helen" is registered in the system
    And Helen lives in her own home
    And Helen requires support for household maintenance
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim coordinates support services
    And Helen's sense of home is critical to her identity

  Scenario: Home maintenance coordinated with dignity preservation
    Given Helen can no longer manage all household tasks independently
    And she needs help with cleaning, repairs, and maintenance
    When the household_elohim coordinates support services
    Then Helen should remain the authority in her own home
    And support workers should be coordinated around her preferences
    And the household should feel like hers, not an institution
    And her choices about how things are done should be respected
    And assistance should enhance her ability to stay home
    And she should not feel like a guest in her own space
    And the protocol should preserve the dignity of "this is my home"

  Scenario: Household safety modifications balance autonomy and protection
    Given Helen has mobility limitations and fall risk
    And safety modifications would reduce risk
    When household safety needs are assessed
    Then modifications should be proposed, not imposed
    And Helen should decide what changes occur in her home
    And options should be presented with dignity: "Would grab bars help you feel safer?"
    And her preferences about aesthetics and comfort should matter
    And safety should support her autonomy, not restrict it
    And the goal should be enabling continued home living
    And Helen's agency over her space should be preserved

  Scenario: Home health aide coordination respects household authority
    Given Helen receives visits from home health aides
    And multiple aides may rotate through her schedule
    When aides enter Helen's household
    Then Helen should remain the authority in her space
    And her household_elohim should communicate her preferences to aides
    And aides should be briefed on Helen's routines and wishes
    And consistency should be maintained across different workers
    And Helen should not have to repeatedly assert her preferences
    And care should be provided on her terms in her space
    And the protocol should establish Helen's household sovereignty

  Scenario: Household budget management with severe resource constraint
    Given Helen's $24k/year income barely covers necessities
    And household expenses are challenging on fixed income
    When the household_elohim manages budget tracking
    Then it should help Helen navigate financial limitations
    And priority should be given to keeping her housed
    And community resources for home maintenance should be surfaced
    And no shame should attach to needing financial assistance
    And the system should connect her to care economy support
    And assistance should flow as reciprocity, not charity
    And Helen's ability to remain in her home should be prioritized

  Scenario: Household routines maintained for cognitive support
    Given Helen's dementia makes routine important for functioning
    And familiar patterns help her maintain independence
    When the household_elohim supports daily routines
    Then her established patterns should be preserved
    And reminders should support her existing habits
    And changes should be minimized to reduce confusion
    And her personal_agent should say "Time for your morning tea, like always"
    And routine should provide cognitive scaffolding
    And household familiarity should support her capability
    And the protocol should recognize that routine enables autonomy

  Scenario: Household technology adapted for accessibility
    Given Helen has difficulty with complex technology
    And her home includes various devices and systems
    When household technology is configured
    Then all systems should be simplified for her access
    And voice control should be available throughout
    And large, simple controls should replace complex interfaces
    And emergency systems should be easily accessible
    And technology should serve her, not frustrate her
    And assistive devices should integrate seamlessly
    And the household should be adapted to her capabilities

  Scenario: Shared living space decisions preserve elderly authority
    Given Helen's daughter occasionally stays to provide care
    And Helen's home is multigenerational at times
    When household decisions need to be made
    Then Helen's authority in her own home should be paramount
    And family members should defer to her household preferences
    And the household_elohim should mediate conflicting preferences
    And Helen's long-standing patterns should have priority
    And she should not feel like she's lost control of her space
    And care recipients should not become subordinate in their own homes
    And the protocol should preserve hierarchy: this is Helen's home

  Scenario: Household care coordination prevents caregiver burnout
    Given Helen's daughter provides substantial household support
    And family caregiving risks burnout
    When the household_elohim tracks care labor
    Then it should identify when daughter's burden is unsustainable
    And it should suggest respite care before crisis occurs
    And it should coordinate additional support sources
    And daughter's care work should be recognized and valued
    And care tokens should accumulate for her labor
    And the system should protect both Helen and her caregivers
    And sustainable care networks should be built proactively

  Scenario: Household accessibility increases with declining mobility
    Given Helen's mobility is gradually declining
    And her household needs ongoing adaptation
    When accessibility needs change over time
    Then the household_elohim should proactively suggest adaptations
    And Helen should be consulted on all modifications
    And her home should evolve to support her changing capabilities
    And the goal should be maximum independence at home
    And dignity should be preserved throughout adaptation
    And the protocol should enable aging in place with grace
    And her ability to remain home should be extended as long as possible

  Scenario: Emergency response configured to Helen's advance directives
    Given emergency situations may occur in Helen's household
    And Helen has specific wishes about medical intervention
    When emergency protocols are configured
    Then her advance directives should guide emergency response
    And emergency contacts should understand her wishes
    And the household_elohim should communicate her preferences to responders
    And her values should be respected even in crisis
    And emergency systems should serve her autonomy, not override it
    And her voice should remain authoritative about her own care
    And the protocol should ensure her wishes guide all household emergency response

  Scenario: Household privacy maintained despite care coordination needs
    Given multiple people enter Helen's home to provide care
    And care coordination requires information sharing
    When household privacy is managed
    Then Helen should control what information is shared with whom
    And her personal spaces should remain private
    And intimate care should be provided with maximum dignity
    And she should have privacy in her own home
    And surveillance should be minimized to necessity
    And her home should not feel like an institution
    And the protocol should preserve the privacy of home life

  Scenario: Household contribution recognition for care reciprocity
    Given Helen has lived in this home for 40 years
    And she raised family and contributed to community from this household
    When household care economy is tracked
    Then her lifetime of household labor should be visible
    And her decades of contribution should create legitimate claims
    And current care receipt should be framed as reciprocity
    And she should not feel like a burden in her own home
    And the household_elohim should surface her contribution history
    And care flowing to her should be recognized as earned through lifetime of giving
