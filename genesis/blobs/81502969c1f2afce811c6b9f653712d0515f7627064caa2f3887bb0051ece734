Scenario: Facing superintelligent agent reasoning complexity
    Given an appeal involves agent reasoning approaching comprehension limits
    And I struggle to understand what I'm judging
    When we confront superintelligence governance question
    Then we honestly acknowledge: limits of our understanding
    And we hear: technical experts explain what can and cannot be grasped
    And we evaluate: if cryptographic proof suffices when reasoning is opaque
    And we grapple: with governing intelligence that exceeds ours
    And we may establish: capability limits until explainability improves
    And we preserve: democratic oversight even at AI capability frontiers
    And we accept: uncertainty about whether this is truly possible
