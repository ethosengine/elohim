Scenario: Blended family and step-family care recognition
    Given many families include step-parents and half-siblings
    And Sarah may have step-family relationships
    When the family_elohim tracks blended family care
    Then it should recognize care across non-biological relationships
    And step-parent care should be valued equally
    And half-sibling care should be recognized
    And diverse family structures should be fully supported
    And care economy should serve all family configurations
    And the system should not privilege nuclear biological family
