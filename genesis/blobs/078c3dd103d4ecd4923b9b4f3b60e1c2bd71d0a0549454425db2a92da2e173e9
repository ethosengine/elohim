Scenario: Household privacy protected amid care intimacy
    Given James provides intimate personal care for David
    And household care generates extremely private data
    When household care is documented
    Then privacy must be absolutely protected
    And David's dignity must be preserved in all data
    And intimate care details should never be exposed
    And household data should remain under James's control
    And privacy protection should be comprehensive and inviolable
