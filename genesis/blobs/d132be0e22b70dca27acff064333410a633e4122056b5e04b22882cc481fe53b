Scenario: Activist opposes new polluting facility with evidence
    Given a company applies for permit to build polluting facility
    And claims it will have minimal environmental impact
    When the Observer analyzes company's environmental track record
    Then the activist shows violations at their other facilities
    And calculates health impacts on nearby residents
    And demonstrates existing pollution burden in target neighborhood
    And organizes affected community for testimony
    And corporate claims meet community evidence
