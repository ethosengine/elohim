Scenario: Technology literacy education adapted for elderly learners
    Given Helen needs technology skills for daily functioning
    And technology education often ignores elderly learners
    When Helen learns to use new technologies
    Then instruction should be adapted to her learning pace
    And age-appropriate pedagogy should be employed
    And no assumption of prior tech knowledge should be made
    And patient repetition should be available
    And learning should serve her actual needs, not abstract skills
    And the protocol should ensure elderly inclusion in digital literacy
    And Helen should be empowered, not left behind by technology
