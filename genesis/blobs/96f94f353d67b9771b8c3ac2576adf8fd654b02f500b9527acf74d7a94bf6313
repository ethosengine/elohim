Scenario: Family care tokens accumulate across all members' contributions
    Given family participates in care token economy
    And Sarah, partner, Tommy, and Emma all contribute
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Sarah's extensive contributions should be valued highly
    And children's age-appropriate work should count
    And partner's contributions should be recognized
    And extended family care should be tracked
    And family care tokens should reflect collective contributions
    And tokens should be available for family resource access
