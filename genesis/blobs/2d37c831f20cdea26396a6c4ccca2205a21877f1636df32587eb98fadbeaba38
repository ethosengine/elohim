Scenario: Investor receives transparent impact reports showing measurable community benefits
    Given stock market investing provides opaque financial returns with invisible social impacts
    And Patricia couldn't verify her portfolio's real effects
    When community investment provides radical transparency
    Then quarterly reports show: 12 workers received ownership and wage increases ($11→$18/hour)
    And 340 community meals served to isolated seniors
    And 1,200 lbs regenerative produce sourced from Johnson Farm
    And $40K circulating locally vs. extracting to distant shareholders
    And community_elohim provides detailed, verifiable impact documentation
