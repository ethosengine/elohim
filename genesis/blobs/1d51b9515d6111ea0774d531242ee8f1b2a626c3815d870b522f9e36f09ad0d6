Scenario: Community leadership positions recognize accumulated care experience
    Given Robert has decades of care economy participation
    And he has demonstrated capability through managing complex responsibilities
    And community needs experienced leadership
    When community_elohim identifies leadership opportunities
    Then it should recognize Robert's accumulated care contributions as leadership qualification
    And surface opportunities: community boards, policy advisory roles, initiative leadership
    And connect his care experience to governance credibility
    And help him understand that his lived experience is valuable wisdom
    And match leadership opportunities to his capacity and interests
    And prevent exploitation of middle-aged adults' sense of responsibility
    And support meaningful community contribution without burnout
