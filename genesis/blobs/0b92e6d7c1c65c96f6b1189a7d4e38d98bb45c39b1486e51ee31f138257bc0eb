Scenario: Parent exposes school resource inequities
    Given the parent suspects their child's school gets fewer resources
    And neighboring school seems to have more programs and facilities
    When the parent reviews Observer's district equity analysis
    Then they see per-student spending varies by thousands of dollars
    And westside schools have gifted programs and experienced teachers
    And their child's school lacks arts, music, and advanced courses
    And systematic inequity pattern becomes documented evidence
    And parent advocacy shifts to structural equity demands
