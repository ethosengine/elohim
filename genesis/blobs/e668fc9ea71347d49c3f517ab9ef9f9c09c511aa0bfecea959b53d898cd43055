Scenario: Mayor monitors policy implementation against intended outcomes
    Given the politician voted for homelessness intervention program
    And expected specific outcomes from policy
    When the Observer tracks implementation
    Then they see which programs launched versus stalled
    And learn actual outcomes compared to projections
    And identify bureaucratic barriers to implementation
    And intervene to align execution with legislative intent
    And ensure votes translate to real community impact
