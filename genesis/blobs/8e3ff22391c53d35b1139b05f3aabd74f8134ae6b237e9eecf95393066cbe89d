Scenario: Receiving fair compensation for real work
    Given Jordan works 15 hours per week at the library
    And Jordan's work contributes genuine value to library operations
    When Jordan receives their paycheck
    Then Jordan is paid at least minimum wage for all hours worked
    And the Value Scanner shows Jordan's earnings and care token accumulation
    And Jordan's work is compensated fairly, not exploited as "therapy"
    And Jordan experiences being a valued worker earning real wages
    And Jordan's economic contribution is recognized through fair pay
    And Jordan's worker status is authentic, not symbolic
