Scenario: Food system workforce development includes democratic governance training
    Given food service and agriculture training focuses on technical skills only
    And democratic enterprises need workers skilled in collaboration and governance
    When industry sector develops democratic food system training programs
    Then workers learn technical skills (cooking, cultivation) plus democratic governance
    And training includes cooperative business, facilitation, and consensus decision-making
    And educational institutions incorporate democratic food system curriculum
    And workforce is prepared for democratic enterprise participation
    And industry_sector_elohim develops training curriculum and coordinates educational partnerships
