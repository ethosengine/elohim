Scenario: Citywide democratic business network emerges from successful conversions
    Given Rosa's conversion inspires other small business owners
    And isolated democratic businesses are vulnerable
    When multiple conversions create critical mass across municipality
    Then democratic business network provides mutual support and coordination
    And owners considering conversion can learn from Rosa and others
    And network advocates collectively for supportive municipal policies
    And citywide democratic economy infrastructure develops (shared services, coordination, advocacy)
    And municipality_elohim facilitates network development and coordination
