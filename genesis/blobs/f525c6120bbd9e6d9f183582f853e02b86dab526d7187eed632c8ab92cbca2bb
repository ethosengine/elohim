Feature: Individual-Level Appeal Process for Appellant
  As an appellant in the governance system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want to appeal AI agent decisions that affect my personal autonomy and dignity
  So that I have meaningful recourse and my voice is heard in decisions that govern me

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the appellant user is registered in the system
    And the individual governance context is active
    And I have the right to appeal any agent decision that affects me

  Scenario: Appeal mental health intervention with privacy concerns
    Given my Family Elohim has alerted my partner about concerning behavioral changes
    And I believe this is an invasion of my privacy
    And I was not in immediate danger
    When I file an appeal through my interface
    And I state my complaint in my own words: "This felt like surveillance"
    Then the appeal is immediately logged with timestamp and cryptographic proof
    And I receive confirmation with appeal tracking number
    And the agent provides its full reasoning transparently
    And I can see the pattern detection logic, confidence levels, and constitutional weighting
    And the appeal is scheduled for Community Elohim review within 24 hours
    And I am notified of my rights including escalation options

  Scenario: Understanding agent reasoning through appeal process
    Given I have filed an appeal against a Family Elohim decision
    And I don't understand why the agent made its choice
    When I request detailed explanation through the appeal interface
    Then I receive layered explanations from plain language to technical detail
    And I can see the constitutional principles the agent applied
    And I can view counterfactual scenarios showing what would change the outcome
    And I can access the cryptographic proof trail
    And Technical experts are available to explain complex aspects if needed
    And all explanations are in accessible language without jargon

  Scenario: Successfully overturning an agent decision through appeal
    Given I appealed a personal autonomy decision
    And the Constitutional Council has reviewed my case
    When the council rules that the agent overstepped constitutional bounds
    Then the agent's decision is immediately overturned
    And my preferences are updated automatically in the system
    And the incident is documented as an error in the agent's record
    And Similar future interventions require higher thresholds
    And I receive notification of the outcome with full reasoning
    And Protocol improvements are proposed based on my case

  Scenario: Appeal unsuccessful but feeling heard through the process
    Given I filed an appeal about a life-saving intervention I felt was invasive
    And the Constitutional Council has deliberated on my case
    When the council affirms the agent's decision as constitutionally aligned
    But also recommends protocol enhancements for pre-specified preferences
    Then I receive detailed explanation of why the decision was upheld
    And I can see how my appeal influenced protocol improvements
    And I am offered support to update my future preferences
    And My dissent is honored and recorded even though I didn't win
    And I understand my voice mattered in making the system better

  Scenario: Escalating appeal when initial review doesn't satisfy
    Given my Community Elohim review upheld the original decision
    And I still believe my constitutional rights were violated
    When I choose to escalate to peer agent review
    Then three randomly-selected Family Elohim agents from other families review my case
    And A Constitutional Council observer monitors the peer review
    And The peer agents investigate deeper than the original review
    And They can override, modify, or affirm the original decision
    And I receive their judgment within one week
    And I retain the right to escalate further to Constitutional Council if needed

  Scenario: Accessing precedent to understand similar cases
    Given I am considering filing an appeal
    And I want to understand how similar cases were decided
    When I search the precedent database for "mental health intervention + privacy"
    Then I can see anonymized cases with constitutional reasoning
    And I can view outcomes and protocol changes that resulted
    And I can see success rates for different appeal types
    And I can understand the constitutional framework being applied
    And This helps me calibrate my expectations and build my appeal argument

  Scenario: Pre-specifying preferences after successful appeal
    Given my appeal was resolved and I gained the right to set preferences
    When I access my preference settings through the interface
    Then I can specify alert preferences for future interventions
    And I can set thresholds like "family alert only after three-day pattern"
    And I can balance my privacy needs with care considerations
    And The agent respects my preferences in future decisions
    And I feel ownership over my own protection rather than being controlled

  Scenario: Protection from retaliation after filing appeal
    Given I filed an appeal that challenged an agent's authority
    And I was concerned about potential retaliation in future decisions
    When I continue interacting with Elohim agents after my appeal
    Then the appeal cannot be used against me in future decisions
    And Agents do not punish me for exercising my right to appeal
    And The system monitors for retaliatory patterns
    And I have recourse if I detect bias based on my appeal history
    And My right to dissent is protected as fundamental to the protocol

  Scenario: Accessing appeals process without technical expertise
    Given I am not tech-savvy and don't understand AI systems well
    And an agent decision has affected me in a way I disagree with
    When I want to file an appeal
    Then I can trigger the appeal with a simple button: "I disagree with this decision"
    And I can state my complaint in plain language without legal jargon
    And I don't need a lawyer or technical knowledge to participate
    And The interface guides me through the process step-by-step
    And Support is available in my language and accessible format
    And The process respects my dignity regardless of my technical literacy

  Scenario: Appeal contributes to constitutional evolution
    Given my appeal revealed a fundamental gap in the constitutional framework
    And the Constitutional Council identified this as a recurring issue
    When the council documents recommendations for protocol improvement
    Then my case becomes input for the next 7-year Constitutional Convention
    And My lived experience of feeling violated despite life-saving intervention
    And This helps shape how care and autonomy are balanced at constitutional level
    And I can see the long-term impact of my appeal beyond my individual case
    And My suffering wasn't wasted—it made the system better for everyone
