Scenario: Constitutional amendment from appellant-driven insights
    Given recurring appeals reveal "developing autonomy is undervalued"
    And adolescent appellants worldwide report dignity violations from overprotection
    When Constitutional Convention deliberates on adolescent autonomy amendment
    Then the amendment proposal is drafted based on appellant experiences
    And the amendment states "developing autonomy is itself a constitutional value"
    And the amendment passes with 85% consensus
    And global protocol is updated to balance safety with growth
    And appellants see their suffering contributed to constitutional evolution
    And future adolescents benefit from improved framework
