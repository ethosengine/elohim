Scenario: Community-supported agriculture (CSA) program provides affordable local food
    Given fresh, organic produce is often unaffordable for low-income community members
    And food access inequality creates health disparities
    When democratic farm implements sliding-scale CSA program
    Then weekly produce boxes are affordable across income levels
    And payment flexibility (sliding scale, work-trade, subsidized) ensures access
    And direct farm-to-community distribution reduces costs increasing affordability
    And food access improves while supporting fair farmworker wages
    And community_elohim manages CSA program ensuring equitable food access
