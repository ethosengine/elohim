Scenario: Water conservation in construction and household practices
    Given water is critical bioregional resource
    And Frank's construction knowledge includes plumbing systems
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates water stewardship
    Then it should facilitate water-efficient plumbing in Habitat work
    And help Frank repair leaks and improve water systems in community
    And track water conservation as ecological care contribution
    And teach water conservation practices to community
    And Frank's skills should serve bioregional water security
    And his expertise should build water-wise infrastructure
