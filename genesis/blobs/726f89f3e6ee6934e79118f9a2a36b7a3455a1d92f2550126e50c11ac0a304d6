Scenario: Study long-term effects on mental health and social cohesion
    Given protocol aims to reduce loneliness and improve wellbeing
    When James analyzes decade of mental health and cohesion data
    Then he finds sustained reduction in loneliness indicators
    And he documents improved community social networks
    And he examines whether benefits distribute equitably
    And he identifies mental health improvements particularly strong for isolated individuals
    And long-term health effects justify protocol as public health intervention
