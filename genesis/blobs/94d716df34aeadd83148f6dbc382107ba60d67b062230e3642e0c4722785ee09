Scenario: Developer receives honest regional impact analysis
    Given a developer claims project creates regional economic benefit
    But analysis omits regional infrastructure burden
    When the Observer provides regional cost-benefit assessment
    Then the developer sees: promised jobs mostly go to workers from outside region
    And traffic impacts affect three counties' transportation networks
    And environmental impacts span watershed affecting six municipalities
    And honest regional accounting reveals actual trade-offs
    And local extraction versus regional benefit becomes clear
