Scenario: Emergency financial assistance during crisis without bureaucratic humiliation
    Given single parents face financial emergencies without partner backup
    And traditional assistance requires invasive documentation and waiting
    When Maria faces financial crisis—medical bill, car repair, unexpected expense
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate rapid emergency assistance
    And help should be available quickly based on care economy standing
    And Maria should not have to prove desperation through bureaucratic gauntlet
    And emergency support should preserve dignity while providing real help
    And care economy should function as community safety net for crisis
