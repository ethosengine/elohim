Scenario: Participating in neighborhood sustainability initiatives
    Given the neighborhood has sustainability projects
    And Aisha wants to reduce environmental impact
    When Aisha joins local sustainability efforts
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate her participation
    And it should connect her to composting, recycling, or garden projects
    And it should recognize her environmental care work
    And neighborhood-level sustainability should be more effective than individual
    And collective action should be facilitated through care economy
    And environmental stewardship should build community
