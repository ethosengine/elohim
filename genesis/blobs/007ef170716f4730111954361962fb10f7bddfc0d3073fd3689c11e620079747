Scenario: Activist prevents extraction by powerful institutions
    Given major foundations want to "support" the climate movement
    And they offer funding that would create dependency and moderate demands
    When the network evaluates the funding opportunity
    Then historical patterns of movement capture surface for consideration
    And communities who worked with these funders share experiences
    And the network collectively evaluates risks and benefits
    And alternative solidarity economy models are proposed
    And the movement maintains independence while building sustainable support
    And extractive relationships are refused through collective accountability
