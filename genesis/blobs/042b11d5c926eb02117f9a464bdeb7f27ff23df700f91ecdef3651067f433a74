Scenario: Accessible household coordination reduces disability-related stress
    Given navigating household management with disability is inherently stressful
    And inaccessible systems compound that stress
    When the household_elohim coordinates household functions
    Then it should actively reduce Alex's cognitive load
    And it should prevent accessibility barriers from becoming crises
    And it should provide gentle reminders and support
    And coordination should feel like genuine assistance
    And Alex should experience less stress, not more
    And the protocol should recognize that accessibility reduces disability
    And good design should make Alex's household management easier than current systems
