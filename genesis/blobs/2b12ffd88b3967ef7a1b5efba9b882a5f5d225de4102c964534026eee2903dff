Scenario: Experience dignity throughout appeal process
    Given Marcus is appealing an agent decision
    And Marcus is angry and feels violated
    When Marcus interacts with the appeal system
    Then the system treats his anger as legitimate data about dignity violation
    And the system does not dismiss him as irrational or ungrateful
    And the system provides empathetic language acknowledging his concern
    And Constitutional Council members listen without judgment
    And Marcus's right to appeal is honored without punishment
    And future agent interactions are not biased by his appeal history
