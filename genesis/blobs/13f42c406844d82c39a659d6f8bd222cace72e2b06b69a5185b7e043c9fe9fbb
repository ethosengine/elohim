Scenario: Participating in national media discourse on AI governance
    Given public understanding shapes political will
    And my voice carries weight as committee chair
    When I engage in public education
    Then I explain: why democratic AI governance matters
    And I describe: how protocol works and what's at stake
    And I acknowledge: uncertainties and limitations
    And I present: alternatives honestly (corporate control, heavy regulation, protocol)
    And I make: case for democratic choice
    And I avoid: partisan framing or ideological advocacy
    And I serve: informed democratic deliberation
