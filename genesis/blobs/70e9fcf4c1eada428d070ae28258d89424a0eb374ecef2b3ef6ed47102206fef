Scenario: Parent care coordinated equitably with siblings
    Given Robert's parents require increasing care support
    And Robert has two siblings: Sarah and Michael
    And care coordination across siblings is often fraught
    When family_elohim coordinates sibling care contributions
    Then it should track each sibling's care contributions
    And make contributions visible to all siblings
    And surface when distribution becomes inequitable
    And facilitate discussion: "Robert has handled 65% of medical coordination this quarter"
    And help siblings negotiate fair distribution based on capacity
    And prevent resentment from invisible labor imbalances
    And support siblings in maintaining relationships while coordinating care
