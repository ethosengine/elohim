Scenario: Emergency household backup when Maria is sick or overwhelmed
    Given Maria has no co-parent to tag in during crisis
    And she must parent even when sick or exhausted
    When Maria faces personal emergency or is at breaking point
    Then the household_elohim should detect crisis situation
    And it should activate emergency backup networks
    And it should connect to neighbors who can provide temporary support
    And it should help coordinate emergency meal provision or childcare
    And Maria should have safety net for the inevitable times she cannot function alone
