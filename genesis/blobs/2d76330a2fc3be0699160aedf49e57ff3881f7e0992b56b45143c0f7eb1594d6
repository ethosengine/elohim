Scenario: Seasonal and weather-related neighborhood mutual aid
    Given Margaret is often available during daytime
    And neighborhood needs vary with seasons and weather
    When the neighborhood coordinates seasonal care
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate seasonal mutual aid
    And Margaret might help with snow observation, mail collection, or storm preparation
    And she should receive help with physical tasks she cannot do
    And seasonal care should be reciprocal and community-building
    And neighborhood resilience should increase through elder participation
    And Margaret should contribute according to her capacity
