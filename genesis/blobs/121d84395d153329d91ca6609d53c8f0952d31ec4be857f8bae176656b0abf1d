Feature: City Hall Accountability Journalism for Journalist
  As a journalist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want comprehensive civic surveillance across all municipal bodies
  So that accountability journalism survives despite newsroom cuts

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the journalist user is registered in the system
    And the municipality governance context is active

  Scenario: Journalist monitors 12 civic bodies with comprehensive surveillance
    Given the journalist is sole reporter covering city hall
    And must cover city council, planning, housing, transit, and 8 other bodies
    When the Observer monitors all municipal meetings simultaneously
    Then the journalist reviews every meeting that happened this week
    And receives alerts prioritizing newsworthy decisions
    And searches across all bodies for patterns and connections
    And comprehensive municipal coverage replaces selective attention
    And one reporter with Observer infrastructure outperforms pre-crisis newsroom

  Scenario: Journalist exposes corruption through pattern recognition
    Given a developer receives zoning variances in three meetings
    And each approval seems procedurally normal in isolation
    When the Observer tracks developer across all city bodies
    Then the journalist sees developer got 8 variances in 18 months
    And identifies campaign donations to council members before each vote
    And finds same developer denied variances in other cities for violations
    And documents revolving door between planning staff and developer
    And publishes investigation exposing systematic corruption

  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks mayor's budget claims in real-time
    Given the mayor gives state of city address with budget claims
    And the journalist watches speech with deadline pressure
    When the Observer provides instant fact-checking against city records
    Then the journalist verifies mayor claims crime is down (true by 3%)
    And fact-checks claim of record affordable housing investment (false - down 12%)
    And checks police budget claim against actual spending (misleading framing)
    And publishes real-time fact-check during speech
    And rhetoric meets evidence-based accountability immediately

  Scenario: Journalist investigates municipal service delivery disparities
    Given residents in certain neighborhoods report neglected infrastructure
    And the journalist suspects systematic discrimination
    When the Observer analyzes municipal operations by neighborhood
    Then the journalist sees pothole repairs average 2 days in white areas
    And same repairs take 47 days in Black neighborhoods
    And code enforcement targets rental properties in immigrant communities
    And documents service quality correlating with neighborhood race and income
    And publishes investigation exposing structural racism in city operations

  Scenario: Journalist tracks city promises to accountability
    Given city council approved affordable housing plan 3 years ago
    And the journalist covered initial announcement and then moved on
    When the Observer alerts on promise implementation timeline
    Then the journalist investigates and finds only 12% of promised units built
    And sees budget that was supposed to fund program redirected elsewhere
    And identifies which council members voted for budget changes
    And publishes accountability story on broken housing commitments
    And politicians learn promises will be tracked and verified

  Scenario: Journalist develops whistleblower source on contract fraud
    Given a city employee witnesses fraudulent contracting
    And fears retaliation for speaking to press
    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel
    Then the whistleblower shares documents through protected system
    And journalist receives evidence of no-bid contracts to connected firms
    And investigates without exposing source identity
    And publishes investigation based on documents and additional reporting
    And source protection enables accountability journalism

  Scenario: Journalist compares city policies to neighboring municipalities
    Given city council debates new approach to homelessness
    And politicians claim no alternatives exist
    When the Observer provides comparative policy analysis
    Then the journalist sees 3 nearby cities using housing-first approach
    And reviews outcome data showing reduced homelessness
    And finds cost comparison showing housing cheaper than criminalization
    And interviews officials in cities with successful programs
    And publishes story presenting evidence-based alternatives
