Scenario: Community supported agriculture integrated with care economy
    Given Sarah's bioregion has CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) programs
    And CSA supports local farmers and environmental health
    When Sarah considers food purchasing options
    Then the bioregional_elohim should highlight CSA opportunities
    And it should coordinate CSA participation with household budget
    And it should track CSA contributions as care work
    And Sarah should support farmers while feeding family
    And care economy should strengthen community-farmer relationships
