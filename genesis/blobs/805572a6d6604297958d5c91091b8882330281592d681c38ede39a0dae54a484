Scenario: Developer faces accountability for greenwashing
    Given a developer claims "sustainable development" in marketing materials
    But environmental review shows minimal actual sustainability
    When the Observer compares sustainability claims to actual practices
    Then analysis reveals: LEED certification was "certified" not "platinum"
    And green features are minimal required by code not additional commitment
    And environmental impact study understated habitat destruction
    And sustainability marketing exceeds actual environmental performance
    And greenwashing faces uncomfortable transparency
