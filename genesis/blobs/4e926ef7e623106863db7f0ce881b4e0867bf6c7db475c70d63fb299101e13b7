Scenario: Advocating for family-friendly workplace policies
    Given Sarah needs flexible scheduling to manage children's needs
    And current workplace policies assume workers have no care responsibilities
    When Sarah advocates for policy change
    Then the workplace_elohim should provide supporting data
    And it should show that working parents need flexibility
    And it should help Sarah make evidence-based case for change
    And advocacy labor should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should amplify parent voices in workplace governance
    And workplace should adopt policies that enable sustainable parenting
