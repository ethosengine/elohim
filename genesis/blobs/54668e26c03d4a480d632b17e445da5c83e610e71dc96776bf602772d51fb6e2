# From ValueFlows to Elohim: Building the Care Economy

## ValueFlows: The Vocabulary

ValueFlows is the vocabulary specification that hREA implements. It defines how to describe economic activity in a way that's:
- **Network-native**: Designed for P2P systems
- **Agent-centric**: Humans, not institutions, are primary
- **Value-aware**: Tracks actual value, not just money

## The Elohim Extension

The Elohim Protocol extends ValueFlows for care economies:

| ValueFlows Concept | Elohim Extension |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Agent | + Care tokens, skill attestations, creator presence |
| EconomicEvent | + Witnessed care work, invisible labor visibility |
| Resource | + Time, attention, emotional labor as resources |
| Appreciation | + Care token grants, community recognition |
| Process | + Care processes, teaching, mentoring |

## Constitutional Flow Control

Elohim adds governance layers that ValueFlows doesn't specify:

```
ELOHIM VALUE FLOW CONSTITUTION

Layer 1: Existential Minimums
- Basic needs flow first
- Care labor always recognized
- Dignity threshold maintained

Layer 2: Contribution Recognition
- Value flows to creators
- Absent creators accumulate in trust
- Derivatives share with sources

Layer 3: Community Circulation
- Velocity requirements
- Accumulation limits
- Community pools

Layer 4: Network Development
- Infrastructure maintenance
- Next community liberation
- Coordination sustainability
```

## Shared Concepts, Aligned Purpose

Both hREA and Elohim share:
- **Visibility**: Making value flows transparent
- **Agency**: Humans control their economic participation
- **Coordination**: Enabling cooperation without central control
- **Recognition**: Valuing contribution beyond monetary payment

hREA provides the infrastructure.
Elohim provides the constitutional purpose.
Together: a care-based economy.
