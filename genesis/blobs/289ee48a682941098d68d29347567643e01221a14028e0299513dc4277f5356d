Feature: Environmental and Planning Governance for Board Member
  As a board member serving on planning commission or environmental board in the public_observer system
  Operating at the ecological functional layer
  I want independent environmental analysis and sustainability expertise
  So that I can make informed decisions on development and environmental impacts despite lacking technical expertise

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the board_member user is registered in the system
    And the ecological governance context is active
    And I am a volunteer serving on planning commission, environmental commission, or conservation board

  Scenario: Planning commissioner evaluates environmental impacts of large development
    Given developer proposes major commercial development on vacant land
    And environmental impact report prepared by developer's consultants
    And staff recommendation supports approval with mitigation measures
    When the planning commissioner requests Observer independent analysis
    Then they receive assessment of impact report methodology and limitations
    And see comparison to development impacts documented in peer jurisdictions
    And access air quality, water, and habitat impact analysis independent of developer framing
    And discover mitigation measures less effective than presented
    And independent analysis reveals environmental impacts developer report minimized

  Scenario: Parks commissioner learns accessible expertise on green infrastructure
    Given parks department proposes converting traditional landscaping to green infrastructure
    And proposal includes technical concepts like bioswales, permeable pavement, native plantings
    And commissioner has no environmental engineering background but must approve plan
    When the commissioner uses Observer accessible expertise
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of green infrastructure approaches
    And see examples from peer cities with implementation outcomes and costs
    And access key questions to ask staff about maintenance and performance
    And understand climate adaptation and water quality benefits
    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment on technical proposal

  Scenario: Planning commissioner tracks developer's environmental commitments from past project
    Given same developer seeking approval for new project
    And past project approved with environmental mitigation commitments
    And commissioner wants to know if developer followed through on previous promises
    When the commissioner uses Observer implementation tracking
    Then they see developer's past project mitigation commitments versus implementation
    And discover tree planting and habitat restoration commitments not fully delivered
    And find stormwater management systems performing below promised levels
    And access documentation showing enforcement gaps by municipality
    And impact tracking reveals developer's track record diverged from promises

  Scenario: Environmental commissioner evaluates watershed protection policy
    Given commission considers strengthening regulations on development near waterways
    And staff presents complex hydrology analysis and regulatory considerations
    And development interests argue restrictions are excessive
    When the commissioner requests Observer environmental policy analysis
    Then they receive comparison of proposed protections to peer jurisdictions' standards
    And see water quality trend data showing current protections insufficient
    And access analysis of development impacts on downstream water quality
    And get examples of how other communities balanced development and protection
    And independent analysis helps commissioner evaluate competing claims

  Scenario: Planning commissioner understands environmental justice dimensions of industrial permit
    Given commission evaluates permit for industrial facility citing pollution
    And facility meets regulatory standards according to staff analysis
    And community members testify about existing pollution burden but lack data
    When the commissioner seeks environmental justice analysis from Observer
    Then they receive cumulative pollution exposure data for affected neighborhood
    And see demographics showing low-income community of color already overburdened
    And access health outcome data correlating with pollution exposure
    And discover neighborhood has multiple polluting facilities unlike affluent areas
    And environmental justice analysis reveals disparate impacts standard permitting ignores

  Scenario: Conservation board member detects greenwashing in sustainability initiative
    Given municipality proposes sustainability plan with ambitious climate goals
    And plan emphasizes renewable energy targets and green building standards
    And board wants to understand if plan will achieve meaningful emissions reductions
    When the board member uses Observer sustainability analysis
    Then they see plan's projected emissions reductions compared to climate science needs
    And discover plan excludes transportation sector responsible for largest emissions
    And find renewable energy targets rely on questionable carbon offset accounting
    And access comparison to peer cities with more comprehensive climate action
    And independent analysis distinguishes authentic sustainability from greenwashing

  Scenario: Planning commissioner evaluates sprawl versus infill development trade-offs
    Given commission faces pressure to approve suburban expansion development
    And developers argue expansion provides affordable housing opportunities
    And environmentalists advocate for urban infill to reduce sprawl
    When the commissioner requests Observer growth pattern analysis
    Then they receive comparison of infrastructure costs for sprawl versus infill
    And see environmental impacts analysis including habitat, emissions, and water use
    And access true affordability analysis accounting for transportation costs
    And understand fiscal impacts on municipality over time
    And accessible expertise helps commissioner evaluate complex growth trade-offs

  Scenario: Environmental commissioner tracks city's climate action plan implementation
    Given city adopted climate action plan with specific reduction targets and timelines
    And annual progress reports from staff emphasize achievements
    And commissioner wants objective assessment of whether city is on track
    When the commissioner uses Observer accountability tracking
    Then they see actual emissions reductions versus plan targets over time
    And discover city is not on track to meet 2030 goals
    And find some action items completed while highest-impact measures delayed
    And access comparison showing peer cities making faster progress
    And accountability tracking reveals gap between plan commitments and implementation

  Scenario: Planning commissioner prepares for climate adaptation zoning update
    Given commission must update zoning to address climate risks like flooding and heat
    And staff proposes complex amendments addressing sea level rise and extreme weather
    And commissioner wants to make informed decisions on technical requirements
    When the commissioner uses Observer decision support
    Then they receive executive summary of climate risks and proposed zoning responses
    And see examples of climate adaptation zoning from vulnerable communities
    And access analysis of which properties and populations most affected by requirements
    And get questions to ask staff about implementation feasibility and equity
    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment on climate adaptation policy
