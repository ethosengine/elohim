Scenario: Learning neighborhood as governance unit
    Given Kenji is learning how communities function
    And neighborhood is often invisible as governance layer
    When the personal_agent teaches Kenji about neighborhood governance
    Then it should help him see neighborhood as care coordination unit
    And it should show how neighborhoods make collective decisions
    And it should teach him that geography creates shared stakes
    And neighborhood should be understood as governance layer
    And the system should build Kenji's civic literacy
    And students should learn that neighborhoods govern local flourishing
