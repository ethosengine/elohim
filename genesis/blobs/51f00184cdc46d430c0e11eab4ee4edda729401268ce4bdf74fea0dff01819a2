Feature: Movement Building Through Affinity Networks for Activist
  As an activist in the social_medium system
  Operating at the affinity_network governance layer
  I want to build solidarity and coordinate action across geographies
  So that movements can grow while respecting local autonomy and context

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the affinity_network governance context is active
    And multiple communities are organizing around related issues

  Scenario: Activist creates cross-geographic climate justice network
    Given activists in 40 cities are working on climate action
    And they share commitment to Indigenous leadership and just transition
    When a founding group creates a climate justice affinity network
    And they establish network charter emphasizing subsidiarity and equity
    And they invite activists from participating communities
    Then the affinity network space is created
    And participants maintain connection to their local communities
    And the network provides coordination without centralized control
    And local autonomy is preserved while enabling collective action
    And shared resources, tactics, and patterns flow through the network

  Scenario: Activist shares successful tactic that spreads through trust
    Given a community successfully pressured a bank to divest from fossil fuels
    And the activist documents the strategy with evidence of impact
    When they contribute the tactic to the climate justice network
    And other activists review and validate the approach
    Then the tactic enters the network's pattern library
    And it surfaces for communities facing similar challenges
    And 23 communities adapt the tactic to their local context
    And improvements flow back into the pattern library
    And the network tracks collective impact across implementations

  Scenario: Activist coordinates rapid response across network
    Given Indigenous land defenders face immediate threat of eviction
    And the situation requires urgent solidarity action
    When the land defenders' community issues call for support
    And the call is verified through network trust relationships
    Then rapid response protocol activates across affinity network
    And each community determines its capacity to respond
    And coordination happens in real-time across time zones
    And actions are culturally appropriate and locally determined
    And the network mobilizes pressure while preventing burnout
    And the land defenders receive coordinated solidarity support

  Scenario: Activist prevents movement co-optation by bad actors
    Given a corporate-funded organization tries to join the network
    And they claim to support climate action but oppose systemic change
    When they attempt to participate in network coordination
    Then their limited community trust becomes visible
    And their ties to fossil fuel funding are surfaced through documentation
    And the network collectively evaluates the participation request
    And communities share experiences with similar co-optation attempts
    And the network maintains boundaries while remaining open to good-faith participation
    And the movement's integrity is protected through transparent evaluation
