Scenario: Multigenerational teaching about ecological care responsibility
    Given Robert teaches values to children and grandchildren through practice
    And ecological sustainability requires intergenerational commitment
    And his generation must prepare next generation for ecological challenges
    When bioregional_elohim supports ecological education
    Then it should help Robert model ecological care practices for younger generations
    And surface teaching opportunities through everyday choices
    And recognize: "Your composting practice teaches grandchildren about waste reduction"
    And support him in explaining ecological choices to family
    And build intergenerational ecological literacy through practice
    And demonstrate that ecological care is care economy responsibility
    And prepare next generation for ecological stewardship
