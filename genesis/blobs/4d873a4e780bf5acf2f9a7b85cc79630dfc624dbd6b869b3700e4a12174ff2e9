Scenario: Preventing social isolation through neighborhood integration
    Given solo parenting is profoundly isolating
    And Maria has limited time and energy for social connection
    When the neighborhood_elohim monitors Maria's social engagement
    Then it should facilitate low-effort neighborhood social integration
    And it should connect her to neighborhood gatherings and events
    And it should enable participation without requiring excessive time or energy
    And neighborhood should provide adult social connection Maria lacks from co-parent
    And Maria should have accessible pathways to community membership despite constraints
