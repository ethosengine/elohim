Scenario: Family decision-making includes elderly voice appropriately
    Given family decisions affect Helen's care and wellbeing
    And Helen retains decision-making capacity
    When family governance processes occur
    Then Helen's voice should carry weight in family decisions
    And she should not be decided about, but consulted
    And the family_elohim should ensure her input is heard
    And family should not override her preferences without consent
    And she should experience agency within family governance
    And the protocol should preserve her standing as family elder
    And respect should be maintained even as care needs increase
