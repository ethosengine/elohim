Scenario: Community economic support recognizes parenting as work
    Given Sarah performs enormous care labor essential to community
    And traditional economy renders this work unpaid
    When the community implements care economy principles
    Then parenting should be recognized as valuable economic contribution
    And care tokens could translate to community currency or benefits
    And Sarah should have economic support for her care work
    And the community should invest in parents as essential workers
    And care economy should provide material support, not just recognition
    And the system should enable economic justice for caregivers
