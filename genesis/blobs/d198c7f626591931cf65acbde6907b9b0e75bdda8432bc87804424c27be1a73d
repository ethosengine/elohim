Scenario: Coordinating support from extended family members who are helpful
    Given some extended family members (my parents, siblings) want to help
    And their support is genuine and appropriate
    When I coordinate family assistance with children or resources
    Then the family_elohim helps me organize extended family support
    And tracks who's helping with what to distribute requests fairly
    And maintains my authority as primary decision-maker
    And ensures family help respects my boundaries and parenting choices
    And facilitates communication about children's needs
    And my personal_agent helps me ask for help when needed
    And recognizes that coordinating family support is labor
    And validates that accepting help is strength, not failure
