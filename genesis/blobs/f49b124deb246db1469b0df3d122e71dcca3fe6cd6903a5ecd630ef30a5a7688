Scenario: Organizer builds cross-school parent coalition for equity
    Given parents at five underfunded schools face similar challenges
    And most parents don't know the pattern is district-wide
    When the organizer uses Observer to document resource inequities
    Then they show per-pupil spending gaps across schools
    And map distribution of enrichment programs and experienced teachers
    And connect parents from different schools around shared interests
    And facilitate coalition demanding equitable resource formula
    And individual school struggles become district equity campaign
