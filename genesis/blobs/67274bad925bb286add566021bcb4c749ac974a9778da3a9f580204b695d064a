Given Global Convention passed ecological standing amendment
And national law must operationalize this
When I translate constitutional evolution into legislation
Then I grant: legal personhood to ecosystems as constitution requires
And I update: property law to reflect ecological rights
And I modify: administrative procedure for ecosystem representation
And I ensure: national law aligns with global constitutional principle
And I demonstrate: how global and national governance coordinate
And I serve: democratic constitutional evolution
And I show: policy making as implementing citizen wisdom
