Scenario: Appeal agent decision that involved factual error
    Given a Family Elohim agent denies teenager permission to attend event
    And the agent based decision on incorrect data about event location
    And the event was actually a volunteer environmental cleanup
    When the teenager files an appeal citing factual error
    Then the appeal is fast-tracked for factual verification
    And peer agents cross-reference data sources
    And the address parsing error is identified
    And the original decision is immediately overturned
    And the appellant receives acknowledgment of the error
    And the error pattern is flagged for protocol improvement
