Scenario: Municipal school policy shaped by parent care work advocacy
    Given Sarah works as teacher and is parent advocate
    And she has deep knowledge of educational needs
    When municipal school policy is debated
    Then Sarah's professional and parent care work should be recognized
    And her advocacy should be informed by care economy data
    And school policy should reflect actual parent and educator experiences
    And care economy should strengthen parent voice in education policy
    And municipal education should benefit from care worker input
