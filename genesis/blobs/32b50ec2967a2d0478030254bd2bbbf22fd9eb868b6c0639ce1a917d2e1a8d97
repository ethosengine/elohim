Feature: Workplace Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities
  As a person with disabilities employed part-time with accommodations
  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer
  I want my workplace rights protected and my contributions recognized
  So that I can work with dignity, proper accommodations, and fair treatment

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the person_with_disabilities user "Alex" is registered in the system
    And Alex works part-time remotely as a data analyst
    And Alex has cerebral palsy affecting mobility and fine motor control
    And Alex's workplace requires ongoing accommodation negotiations
    And the workplace governance context is active
    And the workplace_elohim supports Alex's workplace rights
    And Alex combines part-time employment with disability benefits

  Scenario: Workplace accommodations legally required and systematically tracked
    Given Alex requires specific workplace accommodations
    And accommodations are legally mandated under ADA
    When Alex requests workplace accommodations
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex document accommodation requests
    And it should track whether employer provides required accommodations
    And it should maintain records of all accommodation-related communications
    And Alex should have documentation to support legal action if necessary
    And the protocol should recognize that accommodation is right, not favor
    And Alex should be supported in asserting legal rights
    And workplace obligations should be clearly documented

  Scenario: Protecting Alex from workplace discrimination
    Given workplace discrimination against disabled people is common
    And ableism often operates subtly
    When potential discrimination occurs
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex identify discriminatory patterns
    And it should document incidents that might constitute discrimination
    And it should connect Alex to legal resources and advocacy support
    And patterns across time should be made visible
    And Alex should have tools to protect their workplace rights
    And the protocol should recognize that workplaces can be hostile
    And evidence collection should be systematic and thorough

  Scenario: Flexible scheduling accommodates medical appointments and fatigue
    Given Alex has medical appointments and disability-related health needs
    And fatigue is a real factor in Alex's work capacity
    When Alex manages work schedule
    Then the workplace_elohim should help negotiate flexible scheduling
    And it should track accommodation requests for schedule flexibility
    And Alex should be able to adjust hours around medical needs
    And part-time status should be respected as appropriate for Alex's capacity
    And the protocol should support Alex in managing work-life balance
    And flexible scheduling should be framed as reasonable accommodation
    And Alex's productivity should be measured appropriately for part-time work

  Scenario: Accessible technology is workplace obligation not special treatment
    Given Alex requires accessible technology to perform job functions
    And technology access is fundamental workplace accommodation
    When Alex uses workplace technology
    Then employer must provide accessible technology as legal requirement
    And the workplace_elohim should document technology accessibility
    And it should track when technology barriers prevent Alex from working
    And Alex should not have to use inaccessible systems
    And employer should be held accountable for accessibility failures
    And the protocol should recognize accessible tech as baseline, not luxury
    And Alex's right to accessible tools should be systematically defended

  Scenario: Remote work as disability accommodation maintains employment access
    Given Alex works remotely as necessary accommodation
    And remote work enables Alex's employment despite mobility limitations
    When workplace policies change
    Then Alex's right to remote work accommodation should be protected
    And the workplace_elohim should document remote work as accommodation
    And employer cannot eliminate remote work for Alex without undue hardship proof
    And Alex's legal right to accommodation should override general policy changes
    And the protocol should help Alex defend remote work arrangement
    And pandemic-normalized remote work should benefit disabled workers permanently
    And Alex should not lose employment due to return-to-office mandates

  Scenario: Performance evaluation accounts for part-time status and accommodations
    Given Alex works part-time with accommodations
    And performance should be measured appropriately for Alex's situation
    When Alex receives performance evaluations
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex ensure fair evaluation
    And expectations should be adjusted for part-time hours worked
    And accommodations should not be held against Alex
    And productivity should be measured per hours worked, not full-time standard
    And disability-related absences should not negatively impact evaluation
    And the protocol should support Alex in advocating for fair treatment
    And evaluation should recognize Alex's actual contributions accurately

  Scenario: Workplace culture education reduces ableism
    Given workplace culture often reflects ableist assumptions
    And coworkers may lack disability awareness
    When the workplace_elohim detects cultural issues
    Then it should help Alex identify patterns of workplace ableism
    And it should provide Alex tools to educate coworkers when Alex chooses
    And it should support Alex in advocating for cultural change
    And workplace should be prompted toward disability inclusion training
    And Alex should be compensated if providing disability education
    And the protocol should recognize that cultural change is ongoing work
    And Alex should not bear sole responsibility for workplace education

  Scenario: Preventing workplace retaliation for accommodation requests
    Given employers sometimes retaliate against workers who request accommodations
    And retaliation can be subtle (worse assignments, social exclusion, negative evaluations)
    When Alex requests accommodations or asserts rights
    Then the workplace_elohim should monitor for retaliation patterns
    And it should document timeline of accommodation requests and subsequent treatment changes
    And it should help Alex identify legally actionable retaliation
    And Alex should be connected to legal resources if retaliation occurs
    And the protocol should protect Alex from employer retaliation systematically
    And documentation should support legal claims if necessary
    And Alex should feel supported in asserting rights without fear

  Scenario: Income from employment integrated with disability benefits
    Given Alex receives both part-time employment income and disability benefits
    And benefits coordination is complex
    When the workplace_elohim tracks Alex's income
    Then it should help Alex understand how employment income affects benefits
    And it should alert Alex to earnings thresholds that impact benefits
    And it should integrate with household economics management
    And Alex should be able to make informed decisions about work hours
    And the protocol should support Alex in maximizing total income
    And benefits cliffs should be navigated carefully
    And Alex's economic stability should be optimized across income sources

  Scenario: Professional identity maintained alongside disability identity
    Given Alex is a skilled data analyst with professional expertise
    And disability is part of Alex's identity but doesn't define professional capability
    When workplace interactions occur
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex be seen as competent professional
    And it should support Alex in asserting expertise and professional standing
    And disability should not overshadow Alex's professional contributions
    And Alex should be respected for skills and knowledge
    And the protocol should help balance disability advocacy with professional identity
    And Alex should not have to choose between being professional and being disabled
    And both identities should be honored simultaneously

  Scenario: Career development opportunities accessible to Alex
    Given disabled workers often face barriers to advancement
    And Alex has professional ambitions and development goals
    When career development opportunities arise
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex access training and advancement
    And it should track whether Alex receives equal access to opportunities
    And it should document if disability limits Alex's career progression unfairly
    And Alex should be supported in pursuing professional goals
    And the protocol should help Alex advocate for inclusive career paths
    And advancement should be possible for disabled workers
    And Alex's professional growth should be supported systematically

  Scenario: Workplace privacy protects Alex's medical information
    Given employers should not have access to private medical information
    And disability disclosure is often required but should be limited
    When workplace requests disability documentation
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex share minimum necessary information
    And it should protect Alex's medical privacy rigorously
    And detailed medical information should never be shared with managers or coworkers
    And only accommodation needs should be disclosed, not diagnoses
    And Alex's privacy should be protected even while requesting accommodations
    And the protocol should guide appropriate disclosure boundaries
    And medical information should remain confidential

  Scenario: Collective organizing with other disabled workers
    Given disabled workers face common workplace barriers
    And collective action is more powerful than individual advocacy
    When Alex connects with other disabled workers
    Then the workplace_elohim should facilitate disabled worker organizing
    And it should help Alex build solidarity with other disabled employees
    And collective accommodation requests should be coordinated
    And workplace accessibility improvements should benefit all disabled workers
    And the protocol should support disability labor organizing
    And collective power should be built for systemic workplace change
    And Alex should be connected to broader disability labor rights movements
