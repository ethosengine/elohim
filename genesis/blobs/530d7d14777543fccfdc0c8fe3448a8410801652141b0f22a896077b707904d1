Scenario: Parks board member tracks implementation of playground improvement promises
    Given board approved contract with playground vendor three years ago
    And vendor promised high-quality equipment meeting accessibility standards
    And community members complain about equipment safety and accessibility
    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking
    Then they discover equipment doesn't meet accessibility standards promised
    And see maintenance issues documented across multiple park sites
    And find vendor's performance worse than contract specifications
    And access data showing peer municipalities use better vendors
    And impact tracking reveals vendor failed to deliver promised outcomes
