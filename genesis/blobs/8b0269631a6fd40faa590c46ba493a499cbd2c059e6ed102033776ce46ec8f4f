Scenario: Contributing my lived experience to community knowledge and advocacy
    Given my experience navigating domestic violence, housing crisis, or social services provides valuable insight
    And community advocacy could benefit from my perspective
    When opportunities arise to contribute to advocacy or community knowledge
    Then the Value Scanner facilitates my participation in advocacy
    And values my experiential knowledge as expertise
    And helps me contribute to policy advocacy or community education
    And protects my privacy while amplifying my voice
    And recognizes advocacy participation as valuable community contribution
    And my personal_agent identifies advocacy opportunities matching my capacity
    And tracks my advocacy contributions with care economy credit
    And celebrates that vulnerable people's knowledge shapes community
