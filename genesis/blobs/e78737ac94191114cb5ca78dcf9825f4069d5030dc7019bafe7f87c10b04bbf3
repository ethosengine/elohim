Scenario: Family care tokens acknowledge teen's economic contribution
    Given the family participates in care token economy
    And Jasmine contributes substantial household labor, childcare, and coordination
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Jasmine's contributions should be valued appropriately
    And her care work should be recognized as genuine economic contribution
    And tokens should accumulate to her individual account within the family system
    And she should have voice in how family care tokens are used
    And her standing in family economic decisions should reflect her contribution
    And the token system should make visible what traditional economics renders invisible
