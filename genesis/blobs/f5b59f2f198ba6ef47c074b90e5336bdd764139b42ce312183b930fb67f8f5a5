Scenario: Presenting competing technical interpretations to council
    Given technical experts disagree about transparency method adequacy
    And council needs to understand the disagreement
    When I present both my view and Dr. Chen's alternative
    Then I explain: his argument fairly and completely
    And I articulate: where we agree and where we differ
    And I present: his evidence alongside mine
    And I avoid: dismissing his perspective unfairly
    And I let: council judge which interpretation is more constitutionally aligned
    And I demonstrate: intellectual humility and respect for disagreement
    And council sees: that expertise involves uncertainty
