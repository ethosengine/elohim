Scenario: Contributing to aging parent care from distance
    Given my parents are aging and need increasing support
    And I work full-time with unpredictable schedule
    And I cannot provide hands-on daily care
    When the family coordinates parent care
    Then the protocol should help me contribute within my capacity
    And identify non-time-intensive ways I can support
    And coordinate with siblings who may have different availability
    And recognize my contributions even when limited by employment
