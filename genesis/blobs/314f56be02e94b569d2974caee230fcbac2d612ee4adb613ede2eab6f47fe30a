Scenario: Community governance includes disabled people's voices
    Given community decisions often exclude disabled people
    And "Nothing about us without us" is disability rights principle
    When community governance decisions are made
    Then the community_elohim should ensure disabled people's participation
    And Alex should be included in relevant decision-making processes
    And accessibility should be standard for all governance activities
    And disabled people's expertise should shape community policy
    And the protocol should structurally include disabled voices
    And community should practice disability justice in governance
    And Alex's participation should be valued, not tokenized
