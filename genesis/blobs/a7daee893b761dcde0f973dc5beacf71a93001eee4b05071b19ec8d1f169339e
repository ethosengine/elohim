Scenario: Grappling with universal dignity across cultural differences
    Given appeal involves tension between cultural practice and constitutional principle
    And I must judge what's universal versus culturally specific
    When we deliberate on cultural relativism versus human dignity
    Then we engage: deeply with different cultural perspectives
    And we distinguish: genuine diversity from rights violations
    And we examine: if constitutional framework has cultural bias
    And we consider: if subsidiarity allows variation in this domain
    And we establish: precedent protecting pluralism within dignity bounds
    And we avoid: both cultural imperialism and harmful relativism
    And we demonstrate: wisdom citizens bring to profound questions
