Scenario: Household inventory management made visible
    Given Sarah tracks what's in the pantry, fridge, and cabinets
    And she knows when milk is running low and what needs replacing
    When the household_elohim tracks inventory management
    Then it should recognize this as sophisticated logistics work
    And it should value the mental tracking Sarah performs
    And it should show "Sarah managed 94% of household inventory awareness"
    And this invisible cognitive labor should become visible
    And inventory management should be valued as professional-grade skill
    And the partner should see this work that he doesn't even know happens
