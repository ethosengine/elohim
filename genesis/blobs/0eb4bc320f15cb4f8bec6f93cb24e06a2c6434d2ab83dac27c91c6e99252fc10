Scenario: Customer receives genuine human connection instead of scripted service
    Given corporate service is performed emotional labor monitored by surveillance
    And Ms. Johnson wants authentic connection, not corporate performance
    When democratic ownership frees workers to provide genuine care
    Then DeShawn's smile is authentic because he's valued and treated with dignity
    And conversations are unhurried because workers aren't timed on transactions
    And workers remember Ms. Johnson's preferences through relationship, not data mining
    And service becomes mutual care: workers provide food and connection, customer provides appreciation
    And community_elohim supports relationship building without creating surveillance
