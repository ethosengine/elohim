Scenario: School involvement recognized as substantial care work
    Given Sarah is actively involved in her children's school
    And she volunteers in classrooms, organizes events, advocates for policies
    When community care contributions are tracked
    Then the community_elohim should quantify Sarah's school involvement
    And volunteer hours should be valued as care work
    And parent advocacy should be recognized as community contribution
    And school participation should give Sarah voice in educational governance
    And care for education should be visible and valued
