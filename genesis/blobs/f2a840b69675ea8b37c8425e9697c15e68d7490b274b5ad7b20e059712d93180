Scenario: Learning value literacy through concrete experiences
    Given Tommy is at the concrete operational stage of development
    And abstract economic thinking has not yet developed
    When Tommy uses the Value Scanner to make care decisions
    Then learning should occur through direct, concrete experiences
    And the personal_agent should present choices in tangible terms
    And abstract concepts like "opportunity cost" should not be introduced
    And Tommy should learn by doing: "Strawberries for Emma"
    And value literacy should be built through action, not explanation
    And neural pathways around care-based decision making should form
