Scenario: Municipal policy experimentation enabled by care economy data
    Given Sarah's municipality has care economy data unavailable elsewhere
    And this data enables evidence-based policy innovation
    When municipal government considers new policies
    Then care economy data should enable experimentation
    And policy innovations should be tested with evidence
    And Sarah's municipality should lead in care economy policy
    And successful experiments should be shared with other municipalities
    And care economy should drive progressive municipal governance
