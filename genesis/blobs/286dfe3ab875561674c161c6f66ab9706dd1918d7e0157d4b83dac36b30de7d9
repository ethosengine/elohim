Scenario: Waste reduction and circular economy practices tracked
    Given Jasmine practices waste reduction and composting
    And she chooses products with minimal packaging
    When bioregional_elohim tracks her waste and resource patterns
    Then it should recognize waste reduction as bioregional care work
    And calculate diversion from landfill and resource conservation
    And value her participation in circular economy practices
    And connect individual waste choices to bioregional resource flows
    And demonstrate that waste reduction is care for ecosystem health
    And support transition from linear to circular economic thinking
