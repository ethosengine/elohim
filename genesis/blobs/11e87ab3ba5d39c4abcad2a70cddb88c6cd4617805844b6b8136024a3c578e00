Scenario: Activist exposes charter school segregation and under-performance
    Given charter schools claim to serve disadvantaged students
    But the activist sees segregation and selective enrollment
    When the Observer tracks charter school demographics and outcomes
    Then the activist shows charters are more segregated than district schools
    And suspension rates for Black students are even higher
    And test score gains evaporate when controlling for selective enrollment
    And charter expansion drains resources from district schools
    And privatization agenda meets evidence-based critique
