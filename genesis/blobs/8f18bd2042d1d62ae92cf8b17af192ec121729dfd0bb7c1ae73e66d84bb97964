Scenario: Board member detects potential conflict of interest in vendor contract
    Given district staff recommends multi-million dollar contract with education technology vendor
    And superintendent emphasizes vendor's qualifications and student benefit claims
    And board will vote on contract at next meeting
    When the board member uses Observer capture protection analysis
    Then they discover vendor hired former district administrator as consultant
    And see vendor's student outcome claims not supported by independent research
    And find contract terms more favorable to vendor than peer district contracts
    And access alternative vendors with better evidence and more standard terms
    And capture protection makes relationships and manipulation tactics visible
