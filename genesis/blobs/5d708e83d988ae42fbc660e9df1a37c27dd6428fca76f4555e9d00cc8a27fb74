Scenario: Activist shares successful tactic that spreads through trust
    Given a community successfully pressured a bank to divest from fossil fuels
    And the activist documents the strategy with evidence of impact
    When they contribute the tactic to the climate justice network
    And other activists review and validate the approach
    Then the tactic enters the network's pattern library
    And it surfaces for communities facing similar challenges
    And 23 communities adapt the tactic to their local context
    And improvements flow back into the pattern library
    And the network tracks collective impact across implementations
