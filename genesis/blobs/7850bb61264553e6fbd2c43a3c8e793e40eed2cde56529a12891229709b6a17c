Scenario: Mediating between community members and agents
    Given Community Elohim makes decisions affecting Riverside residents
    And some residents don't understand or disagree with decisions
    When I serve as bridge between residents and agent governance
    Then I explain: how protocol works in accessible language
    And I facilitate: residents filing appeals when appropriate
    And I provide: context to Constitutional Council about local culture
    And I advocate: for residents when agents miss local knowledge
    And I maintain: boundary where I don't control agents but collaborate
    And I enable: democratic participation in AI governance
    And I am accountable: to residents through elections
