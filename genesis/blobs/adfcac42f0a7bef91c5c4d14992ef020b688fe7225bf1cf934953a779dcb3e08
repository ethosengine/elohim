Scenario: Volunteer labor addressing municipal housing needs quantified
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity
    And Habitat builds affordable housing the municipality fails to provide
    And his volunteer work substitutes for municipal housing policy
    When the municipal_elohim tracks housing care economy
    Then Frank's volunteer construction work should be quantified
    And aggregate volunteer labor should be calculated municipality-wide
    And data should reveal that volunteers provide housing infrastructure
    And municipal housing policy should recognize volunteer contributions
    And Frank's work should demonstrate need for municipal investment
    And volunteers should be understood as filling municipal policy gaps
