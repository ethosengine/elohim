Scenario: Parent evaluates development affecting school routes
    Given a developer proposes construction near their child's school
    And claims it will "benefit the community"
    When the parent reviews Observer analysis
    Then they see traffic impacts on school walking routes
    And understand safety implications for children's commutes
    And view how construction timing affects school access
    And can challenge developer claims with child-safety data
    And parent concerns are grounded in evidence not just fear
