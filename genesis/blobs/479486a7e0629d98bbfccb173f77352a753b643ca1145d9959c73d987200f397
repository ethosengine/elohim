Scenario: My healthcare amendment proposal passes convention
    Given my nursing experience revealed healthcare as dignity issue
    And I proposed amendment recognizing healthcare as constitutional right
    When convention deliberates my proposal
    Then delegates hear: my testimony about dignity in healthcare
    And they discuss: healthcare across diverse economic contexts
    And they debate: what healthcare dignity requires constitutionally
    And they refine: language to work across cultures and nations
    And they vote: and my amendment passes
    And I have: shaped constitution for human-AI partnership
    And I know: ordinary nurse from small town helped write law for humanity
    And I embody: democratic possibility that anyone can govern
