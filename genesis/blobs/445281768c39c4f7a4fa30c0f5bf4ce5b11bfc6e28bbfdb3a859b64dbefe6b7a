Scenario: Community medical equipment lending supported by care economy
    Given David needs increasing assistive equipment as disease progresses
    And purchasing equipment is financially impossible
    When James needs medical equipment
    Then the community_elohim should connect to equipment lending libraries
    And his care contributions should give standing to access equipment
    And borrowing should be dignified and based on care economy
    And community should pool medical resources for caregiver access
    And equipment access should reduce financial burden
