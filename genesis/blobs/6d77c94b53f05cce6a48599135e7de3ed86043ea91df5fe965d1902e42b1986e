Scenario: Transportation choices balance care needs with ecological impact
    Given Robert travels for work, parent care, and family support
    And transportation has substantial ecological impact
    And care responsibilities create transportation needs
    When bioregional_elohim analyzes transportation
    Then it should track transportation ecological impact
    And help Robert optimize travel to reduce impact while meeting care needs
    And surface alternatives: "Video call could replace 200-mile drive for parent check-in"
    And recognize when care needs require travel despite ecological cost
    And support sustainable transportation choices where possible
    And prevent guilt about necessary care-related travel
    And build transportation patterns that balance care and ecology
