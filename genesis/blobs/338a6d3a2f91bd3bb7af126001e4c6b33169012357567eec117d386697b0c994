Scenario: Household budget management on fixed retirement income
    Given Margaret's household has fixed income of $32k/year
    And income cannot be increased through additional employment
    When the household_elohim manages resource allocation
    Then it should track all household expenses and patterns
    And it should optimize spending across categories
    And it should identify opportunities for cost reduction
    And it should help Margaret maintain quality of life within constraints
    And the $150/week grocery budget should be managed carefully
    And household financial dignity should be preserved
    And the framing should be resource optimization, not poverty
