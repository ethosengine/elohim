Scenario: Sibling relationships and care coordination
    Given Sarah's siblings also have care responsibilities
    And they coordinate care for aging parents
    When the family_elohim tracks sibling care contributions
    Then it should show who is doing what for parents
    And it should prevent care labor from falling unequally on one sibling
    And it should enable equitable distribution of elder care
    And sibling relationships should be based on fair care sharing
    And the system should prevent family dynamics where one child does everything
    And care economy should create accountability among siblings
