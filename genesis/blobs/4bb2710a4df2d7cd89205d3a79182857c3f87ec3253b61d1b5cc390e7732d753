Scenario: Sibling care relationships built through mutual recognition
    Given Emma cares for Tommy and Tommy cares for Emma
    And both children make care contributions
    When the family_elohim tracks sibling interactions
    Then reciprocal care patterns should be highlighted
    And Emma should be prompted to recognize Tommy's care for her
    And Tommy should be prompted to recognize Emma's help
    And the family should see mutual care, not hierarchy
    And positive feedback loops should strengthen sibling bonds
    And care economy should build family relationships
