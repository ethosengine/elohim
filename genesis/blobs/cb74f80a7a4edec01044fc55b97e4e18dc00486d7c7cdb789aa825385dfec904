Scenario: Municipal economic development includes care economy
    Given traditional economic development ignores care work
    And Sarah's care contributions create substantial value
    When municipal economic development is planned
    Then care economy should be recognized as economic sector
    And care work should be counted in municipal GDP calculations
    And economic development should support care economy infrastructure
    And municipal prosperity should reflect care creates value
    And economic planning should include invisible care labor
