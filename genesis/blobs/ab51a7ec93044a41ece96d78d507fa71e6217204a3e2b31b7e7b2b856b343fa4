Scenario: Supporting family members during crisis
    Given a family member experiences health crisis or emergency
    When I want to help but have employment obligations
    Then the protocol should help me assess my options
    And coordinate with other family members for coverage
    And help me communicate with my employer about family needs
    And support me in balancing work demands with family care
