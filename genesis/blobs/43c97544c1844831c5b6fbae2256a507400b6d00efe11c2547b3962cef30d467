Scenario: Customer notices quality improvement through worker ownership
    Given corporate model pressured quality cuts for profit maximization
    And Ms. Johnson accepted mediocre quality as inevitable for fast food
    When worker ownership aligns incentives with quality
    Then food tastes better because workers care about product they own
    And vegetables are fresh (from Johnson Farm, not corporate distributor)
    And cleanliness improves through worker pride in ownership
    And quality exceeds previous corporate standards while prices remain affordable
    And community_elohim documents quality improvements for customer awareness
