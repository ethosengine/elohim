Feature: Municipal Development Navigation for Developer Interests
  As a developer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want transparent approval processes and honest engagement infrastructure
  So that responsible development gains competitive advantage over extractive practices

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the developer_interests user is registered in the system
    And the municipality governance context is active

  Scenario: Responsible developer navigates approval process transparently
    Given a developer is proposing affordable housing project
    And wants to understand complete approval pathway
    When the Observer provides civic process navigation
    Then the developer sees required steps: zoning review, planning commission, city council
    And receives timeline estimates and submission requirements
    And identifies relevant regulations and precedents
    And connects to appropriate civic contacts
    And navigates process efficiently without buying insider access
    And transparent process reduces corruption opportunities

  Scenario: Developer builds genuine community support through honest engagement
    Given a developer is planning mixed-use development
    And recognizes that authentic community input creates sustainable projects
    When the Observer facilitates real community engagement
    Then the developer accesses genuine community priorities not astroturf voices
    And learns neighborhood actually needs affordable retail space and childcare
    And adjusts project design to address real community needs
    And negotiates community benefits agreement with accountability tracking
    And builds lasting community relationships not managed opposition

  Scenario: Responsible developer leverages positive track record
    Given a responsible developer delivered promised benefits in three past projects
    And competes against extractive developer with misleading claims
    When the Observer makes track records visible
    Then the responsible developer's history shows: jobs delivered matched projections
    And community benefits were actually built and maintained
    And environmental commitments were kept
    And positive reputation becomes competitive advantage
    And integrity creates market differentiation

  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for past broken promises
    Given a developer claimed "200 jobs" in previous project
    But Observer tracking shows only 12 permanent jobs materialized
    When the developer proposes new project with similar claims
    Then planning commission sees documented gap between promises and delivery
    And community members access track record evidence
    And developer must explain past failures or adjust projections
    And accountability creates pressure for honest projections
    And extractive practices face uncomfortable transparency

  Scenario: Developer receives honest cost-benefit analysis
    Given a developer projects $5M annual tax revenue from proposed development
    But omits infrastructure costs and school capacity burden
    When the Observer provides independent analysis
    Then the developer sees: net tax impact only $800K after infrastructure costs
    And school enrollment increase requires $2M capacity expansion
    And traffic impacts need $1.5M intersection improvements
    And honest accounting reveals actual community trade-offs
    And realistic projections inform better civic decisions

  Scenario: Developer relationship transparency creates ethical incentives
    Given a developer has made campaign donations to three council members
    And those members must vote on the developer's project
    When the Observer makes relationships visible
    Then constituents see donation patterns and voting correlations
    And the developer faces scrutiny about influence versus merit
    And council members face accountability for conflicts of interest
    And transparency creates pressure for decisions based on community benefit
    And legitimate projects must stand on merits not political relationships

  Scenario: Developer community benefits agreement gains enforcement mechanism
    Given a developer negotiated affordable housing units as approval condition
    And promised childcare facility and public greenspace
    When the Observer tracks commitment delivery
    Then community members monitor construction and occupancy
    And see whether affordable units are actually rented to qualifying residents
    And track whether childcare facility opens as promised
    And developer reputation depends on honoring commitments
    And binding accountability replaces unenforceable promises
