Scenario: Parenting recognized as community care contribution
    Given Sarah is raising children who will become community members
    And she is preparing them for civic participation and social responsibility
    When the community_elohim tracks Sarah's contributions
    Then it should recognize parenting as community-building work
    And raising future citizens should be valued as civic labor
    And Sarah's parenting should accumulate community care tokens
    And her work should be recognized as essential to community continuity
    And parenting should be understood as public good, not private consumption
    And the community should value child-rearing as collective investment
