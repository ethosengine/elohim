    Given locations were known as ChickenMax #247, #248, #249

    And others may maintain brand temporarily during transition
    And customers are informed: same workers, democratic ownership, community commitment
    And brand transition communicates values shift from corporate to community
    And workplace_elohim manages customer communication during rebranding
