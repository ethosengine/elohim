Scenario: Appeal outcome influences provincial policy making
    Given my appeal revealed gap between agent governance and state law
    And Constitutional Council recommendations identify needed legal changes
    When Senator Ruiz reviews appeal precedents for policy insights
    Then she uses my case as evidence in legislative hearings
    And She crafts legislation addressing the constitutional gap
    And She cites the council's reasoning in justifying policy changes
    And My individual appeal contributes to democratic policy improvement
    And Constitutional governance and representative democracy work together
    And Policy makers learn from Constitutional Council wisdom
