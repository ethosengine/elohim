Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Adult
  As an adult making consumption choices
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want to balance cost, nutrition, and environmental impact
  So that care for people and care for planet are integrated

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the adult user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah manages household food purchasing on limited budget
    And Sarah is teaching children environmental stewardship
    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active
    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates environmental care economy
    And Sarah's consumption choices affect ecological systems

  Scenario: Balancing ecological impact with household budget constraints
    Given Sarah wants to make environmentally responsible choices
    And household budget is $65k/year with tight food budget
    When Sarah makes purchasing decisions
    Then the bioregional_elohim should present ecological impact information
    And it should integrate cost, nutrition, and environmental factors
    And it should help Sarah make best choices within budget constraints
    And ecological care should not be only available to wealthy
    And affordable options should be environmentally informed

  Scenario: Teaching children environmental stewardship through shopping
    Given Sarah is raising Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And she wants them to learn ecological care
    When Sarah uses the Value Scanner with children
    Then the bioregional_elohim should provide age-appropriate environmental education
    And Tommy should learn concrete care for food (not abstract sustainability)
    And Emma should learn connections between care for people and planet
    And shopping should be teaching moment for ecological stewardship
    And children should internalize environmental care as care work

  Scenario: Local food systems supported through care economy purchases
    Given Sarah's bioregion has local food producers
    And supporting local agriculture has environmental and community benefits
    When Sarah makes food purchasing decisions
    Then the bioregional_elohim should highlight local options
    And it should show environmental benefits of local food
    And it should facilitate connections to local producers
    And Sarah's purchases should support bioregional food security
    And care economy should strengthen local food systems

  Scenario: Seasonal eating aligned with bioregional food production
    Given Sarah's bioregion has seasonal food availability
    And seasonal eating reduces environmental impact and cost
    When Sarah plans meals
    Then the bioregional_elohim should suggest seasonal options
    And it should educate about bioregional growing patterns
    And it should help Sarah align purchases with local seasons
    And seasonal eating should be framed as care for place
    And bioregional awareness should shape consumption patterns

  Scenario: Environmental impact visible in consumption decisions
    Given Sarah wants to minimize environmental harm
    And impact information is often hidden from consumers
    When Sarah scans products
    Then the bioregional_elohim should display environmental impact data
    And it should show carbon footprint, water use, soil health, biodiversity effects
    And it should make ecological costs visible alongside monetary costs
    And Sarah should make informed choices about environmental impact
    And visibility should enable environmentally conscious consumption

  Scenario: Reducing food waste through care economy planning
    Given household food waste has environmental and economic costs
    And Sarah wants to minimize waste
    When Sarah plans shopping and meals
    Then the bioregional_elohim should help prevent overbuying
    And it should track household consumption patterns
    And it should suggest portions appropriate to family size
    And food waste should be minimized through better planning
    And care for food should include using what is purchased

  Scenario: Bioregional care economy connects households to land stewardship
    Given Sarah's household depends on bioregional ecological health
    And land stewardship is collective care work
    When Sarah participates in bioregional care economy
    Then the bioregional_elohim should connect her to land stewardship opportunities
    And it should link food purchases to regenerative agriculture
    And it should enable Sarah to support ecological restoration
    And care for land should be recognized as care work
    And bioregional care should extend beyond human relationships

  Scenario: Community supported agriculture integrated with care economy
    Given Sarah's bioregion has CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) programs
    And CSA supports local farmers and environmental health
    When Sarah considers food purchasing options
    Then the bioregional_elohim should highlight CSA opportunities
    And it should coordinate CSA participation with household budget
    And it should track CSA contributions as care work
    And Sarah should support farmers while feeding family
    And care economy should strengthen community-farmer relationships

  Scenario: Ecological care contributions recognized in care token economy
    Given Sarah makes environmentally conscious choices
    And ecological care is care work that benefits everyone
    When Sarah's care contributions are tracked
    Then environmental care choices should generate care tokens
    And Sarah should be recognized for ecological stewardship
    And care for planet should be valued alongside care for people
    And care tokens should incentivize environmental care
    And ecological care should be integrated into care economy

  Scenario: Bioregional resilience built through local care economy networks
    Given climate change increases need for local resilience
    And Sarah's bioregion needs to build adaptive capacity
    When bioregional care economy develops
    Then the bioregional_elohim should coordinate local resource networks
    And it should strengthen connections between producers and consumers
    And it should build bioregional food security
    And local resilience should be created through care economy practices
    And climate adaptation should be care economy project

  Scenario: Teaching next generation that ecological care is care work
    Given Sarah is raising children in care economy
    And environmental crisis requires cultural transformation
    When Sarah teaches children about environmental care
    Then the bioregional_elohim should support ecological education
    And children should learn that care for planet is care work
    And environmental stewardship should be integrated into value literacy
    And next generation should assume ecological care creates value
    And cultural transformation should include environmental care

  Scenario: Bioregional governance includes care economy participants
    Given Sarah participates actively in bioregional care economy
    And bioregional governance affects ecological health
    When bioregional policy decisions are made
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her voice
    And those who practice ecological care should influence ecological policy
    And bioregional governance should be informed by care economy data
    And care for land should create standing in land governance
    And ecological democracy should include care economy participants

  Scenario: Regenerative consumption replaces extractive consumption patterns
    Given traditional consumption extracts from ecological systems
    And Sarah wants to shift to regenerative practices
    When Sarah makes consumption choices over time
    Then the bioregional_elohim should guide toward regenerative options
    And it should educate about regenerative agriculture principles
    And Sarah's consumption should support ecological health
    And care economy should enable shift from extraction to regeneration
    And household consumption should contribute to ecosystem restoration
