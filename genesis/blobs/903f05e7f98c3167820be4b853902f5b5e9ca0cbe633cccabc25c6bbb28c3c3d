Scenario: Industry retirement and benefits policy includes care economy
    Given Robert approaches retirement years
    And industry benefits often inadequately support caregivers
    And retirement policy should recognize care contributions
    When industry_elohim supports benefits policy advocacy
    Then it should help Robert advocate for care-inclusive benefits
    And support industry adoption of caregiver support benefits
    And help develop retirement policy that values care economy participation
    And build benefits frameworks that support multigenerational care
    And advance industry benefits that recognize whole-person needs
    And demonstrate that care economy should inform benefits design
    And create industry practices that support lifecycle care needs
