Scenario: Relationship-based learning preserves wonder
    Given Tommy needs wonder preservation during learning
    And relationship is primary for ages 5-7
    When the personal_agent teaches Tommy about care economy
    Then teaching should happen through story and relationship
    And the agent should feel like a caring guide, not a system
    And learning should be framed as adventures: "What will make Emma smile?"
    And transactional language should never be used
    And wonder at the world should be preserved, not diminished
    And the magic of caring should remain intact
