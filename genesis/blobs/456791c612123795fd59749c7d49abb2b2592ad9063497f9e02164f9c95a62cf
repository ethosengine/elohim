Scenario: Preventing employer pressure to prioritize work over education
    Given some employers pressure students to work more hours
    And employer interests can conflict with student educational needs
    When employer requests Kenji increase hours or skip classes for work
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Kenji maintain boundaries
    And it should validate his right to prioritize education
    And it should provide language for declining inappropriate requests
    And it should recognize that education is his primary work
    And the system should support students resisting employer overreach
    And Kenji should have agency to protect his educational investment
