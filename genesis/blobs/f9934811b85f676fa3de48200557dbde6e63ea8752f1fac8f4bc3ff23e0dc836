Scenario: Activist demands community benefits agreement for development
    Given a developer seeks public subsidies for project
    And claims it will "create jobs"
    When the Observer analyzes developer's labor track record
    Then the activist shows previous projects created mostly temp low-wage work
    And demonstrates few jobs went to local community members
    And reveals history of labor violations and union-busting
    And organizes coalition demanding binding labor standards
    And economic development serves workers not just capital
