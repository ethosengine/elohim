Scenario: Educational expenses tracked and valued as investment
    Given Sarah spends money on books, materials, educational experiences
    And educational expenses are part of parenting work
    When the educational_elohim tracks family educational investment
    Then it should recognize financial investment in children's learning
    And it should help Sarah budget for educational needs
    And educational expenses should be visible to extended family
    And the community should support family educational investment
    And the system should recognize both time and money spent on education
    And care tokens should reflect total educational contribution
