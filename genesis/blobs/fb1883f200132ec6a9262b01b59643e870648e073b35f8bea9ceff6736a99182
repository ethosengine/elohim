Scenario: Appeal mental health intervention that violated privacy
    Given Marcus is experiencing behavioral changes
    And his Family Elohim detects patterns indicating suicide risk
    And the agent alerts his partner following graduated intervention protocol
    When Marcus feels his privacy was violated despite life-saving intent
    And Marcus triggers an appeal through his interface
    Then the appeal is immediately logged with timestamp
    And the Family Elohim provides full constitutional reasoning
    And the reasoning includes pattern detection details with 85% confidence
    And the reasoning explains care vs. privacy weighting
    And Marcus receives plain language explanation within minutes
    And the appeal is routed to Community Elohim for first-layer review
