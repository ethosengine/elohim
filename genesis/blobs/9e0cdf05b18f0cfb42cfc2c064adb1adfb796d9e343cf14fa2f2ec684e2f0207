Scenario: Ecological impact of household coordination
    Given Kenji lives with three roommates
    And household coordination can reduce ecological impact
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks household ecological practices
    Then it should recognize shared living as ecologically efficient
    And it should show how cooking for four is more efficient than four cooking separately
    And it should value household bulk buying as reducing packaging waste
    And it should accumulate care tokens for ecological household practices
    And the system should recognize household coordination as ecological care
    And shared living should be valued as sustainability practice
