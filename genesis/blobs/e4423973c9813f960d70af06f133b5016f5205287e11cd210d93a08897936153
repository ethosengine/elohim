Scenario: National precedent reconciles conflicting regional interpretations
    Given different regions have interpreted constitutional principles differently
    And I appealed a decision that was legal in some regions but not others
    When National Constitutional Council provides definitive interpretation
    Then they honor legitimate regional diversity where constitutional
    And They establish national minimums that all regions must respect
    And They explain which variation is permitted and which violates constitution
    And They create coherence without imposing uniformity
    And Regional councils reference national precedent for guidance
    And My appeal contributes to coherent constitutional governance at scale
