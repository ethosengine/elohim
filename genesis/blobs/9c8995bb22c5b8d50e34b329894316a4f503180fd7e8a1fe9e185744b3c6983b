Scenario: Community care economy connects personal and collective transformation
    Given Robert participates in care economy personally
    And his position enables him to influence broader systems
    And personal and systemic change reinforce each other
    When community_elohim supports his participation
    Then it should help him see connections between personal care and system change
    And surface opportunities to advocate professionally for care economy principles
    And support him in spreading care economy through his networks
    And recognize that his generation can drive mainstream adoption
    And help him leverage professional, economic, and political position
    And build movement for care economy transformation
    And demonstrate that personal practice and systemic advocacy work together
