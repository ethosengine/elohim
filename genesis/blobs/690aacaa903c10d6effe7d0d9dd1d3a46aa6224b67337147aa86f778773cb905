Scenario: Accessing precedent to understand similar cases
    Given I am considering filing an appeal
    And I want to understand how similar cases were decided
    When I search the precedent database for "mental health intervention + privacy"
    Then I can see anonymized cases with constitutional reasoning
    And I can view outcomes and protocol changes that resulted
    And I can see success rates for different appeal types
    And I can understand the constitutional framework being applied
    And This helps me calibrate my expectations and build my appeal argument
