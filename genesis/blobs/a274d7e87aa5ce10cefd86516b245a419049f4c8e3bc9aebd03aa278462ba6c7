Scenario: Coordinating across neighborhoods with different needs
    Given Riverside has neighborhoods with different priorities
    And downtown needs economic development
    And residential areas prioritize environmental protection
    And outskirts need infrastructure investment
    When I facilitate municipal coordination
    Then Municipal Elohim: helps identify resource flows and conflicts
    And city council: deliberates on balancing neighborhood needs
    And we ensure: each neighborhood has voice in decisions
    And we negotiate: resource allocation serving whole city
    And protocol enables: coordination without centralization
    And neighborhoods retain: autonomy within municipal framework
    And I facilitate: democratic negotiation across differences
