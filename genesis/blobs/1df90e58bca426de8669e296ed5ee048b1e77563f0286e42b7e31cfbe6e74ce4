Scenario: Teacher tracks state education legislation affecting classroom
    Given state legislature is considering education bills
    And teachers can't track complex legislative processes while teaching
    When the Observer monitors state education legislation
    Then teachers receive alerts on bills affecting their work
    And get plain-language summaries of education policy changes
    And see projected impact on classroom teaching and learning
    And access advocacy pathways (testimony, legislator contact, coalition)
    And state policy becomes visible and actionable for frontline professionals
