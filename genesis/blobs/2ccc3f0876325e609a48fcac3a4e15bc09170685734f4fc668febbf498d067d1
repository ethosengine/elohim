Scenario: Owner systematically transfers tacit business knowledge to workers
    Given Rosa has 15 years of operational expertise workers need to succeed
    And her knowledge includes supplier relationships, customer preferences, and workflow optimization
    When workplace_elohim initiates knowledge transfer protocols
    Then Rosa participates in documented teaching sessions covering key business areas
    And her expertise is captured through video demonstrations and written guides
    And workers learn bookkeeping, supplier negotiation, and customer relations
    And relationship maps show supplier and customer networks with context
    And knowledge becomes institutional memory, not dependent on Rosa's presence
