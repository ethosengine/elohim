Scenario: Manager's expertise is valued without requiring worker subordination
    Given Marcus has genuine operational expertise from years of experience
    And corporate role required worker subordination to exercise that expertise
    When Marcus transitions to democratic coordinator
    Then his scheduling knowledge becomes proposals, not commands
    And his operations expertise is valued through consultation, not authority
    And workers request his input because it's helpful, not because it's mandated
    And his compensation ($72K) reflects expertise without extraction premium
    And his purpose comes from service, not domination
