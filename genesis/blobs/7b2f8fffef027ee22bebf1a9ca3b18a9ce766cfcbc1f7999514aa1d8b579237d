Scenario: Household emergency support and mutual aid
    Given one roommate might face financial crisis or sudden need
    And students often live very close to financial edge
    When a household member experiences emergency
    Then the household_elohim should facilitate mutual aid
    And it should help coordinate support: "Can roommates each contribute $20 to help Jordan?"
    And it should track emergency help as care tokens
    And it should build culture of reciprocal support
    And the system should recognize households as safety nets
    And roommate mutual aid should be valued and visible
