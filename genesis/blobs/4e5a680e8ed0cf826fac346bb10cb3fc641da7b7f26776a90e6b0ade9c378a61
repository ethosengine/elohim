Scenario: Municipal food security programs recognize retired residents on fixed income
    Given Frank lives on $28k/year fixed income
    And food costs are significant portion of limited budget
    When the municipal_elohim coordinates food security
    Then Frank should access municipal food programs without stigma
    And his care contributions should be visible in program eligibility
    And food assistance should be framed as reciprocity, not charity
    And municipal programs should recognize his volunteer contributions
    And care economy should connect to food security infrastructure
    And Frank should experience dignity in accessing food resources
