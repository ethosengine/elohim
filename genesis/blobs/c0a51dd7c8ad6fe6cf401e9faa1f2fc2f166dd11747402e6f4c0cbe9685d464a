Scenario: Bioregional economic localization supports care and ecological resilience
    Given globalized economy increases ecological impact
    And bioregional economic localization can reduce impact while building care economy
    And Robert's economic choices affect regional resilience
    When bioregional_elohim supports economic localization
    Then it should help Robert source goods and services bioregionally
    And connect him to regional producers, workers, and care economy networks
    And recognize that local economic participation reduces transportation impact
    And demonstrate that care economy and ecological sustainability align through localization
    And build bioregional economic resilience through local exchange
    And reduce ecological impact through regional economic relationships
    And advance care economy through bioregional economic networks
