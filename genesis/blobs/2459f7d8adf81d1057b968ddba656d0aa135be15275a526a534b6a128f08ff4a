Scenario: Household safety modifications balance autonomy and protection
    Given Helen has mobility limitations and fall risk
    And safety modifications would reduce risk
    When household safety needs are assessed
    Then modifications should be proposed, not imposed
    And Helen should decide what changes occur in her home
    And options should be presented with dignity: "Would grab bars help you feel safer?"
    And her preferences about aesthetics and comfort should matter
    And safety should support her autonomy, not restrict it
    And the goal should be enabling continued home living
    And Helen's agency over her space should be preserved
