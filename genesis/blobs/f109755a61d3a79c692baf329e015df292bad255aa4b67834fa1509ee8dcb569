Scenario: Setting boundaries with institutions and service providers
    Given I am navigating multiple social service systems
    And some institutional demands feel invasive or harmful
    When I identify a boundary I need to maintain
    Then the Value Scanner helps me understand my rights
    And provides language for asserting my boundaries
    And tracks instances where institutions violate my boundaries
    And connects me to advocacy support when needed
    And validates that boundary-setting is healthy and appropriate
    And my personal_agent coaches me through difficult conversations
    And recognizes that protecting my wellbeing is my right
    And supports me in saying "no" when necessary
