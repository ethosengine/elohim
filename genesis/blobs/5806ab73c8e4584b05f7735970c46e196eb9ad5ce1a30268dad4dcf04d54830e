Scenario: Citizen understands city budget trade-offs
    Given the city council is deciding the annual budget
    And a 300-page budget document was released
    When the citizen reviews the Observer summary
    Then they see clear spending priorities in plain language
    And understand which neighborhoods get infrastructure investment
    And view trade-offs between services (parks vs roads vs libraries)
    And can submit position on budget priorities in 10 minutes
    And complex civic decisions become comprehensible
