Scenario: Community-level insights appropriate for child understanding
    Given neighborhood_elohim aggregates community data
    And Emma is old enough to understand patterns
    When Emma receives neighborhood-level information
    Then insights should be concrete and age-appropriate
    And the agent should say "Your neighborhood buys a lot of fresh vegetables"
    And abstract data should not be presented
    And community patterns should be framed in care terms
    And Emma should learn about collective behavior through simple examples
    And complexity should be appropriately filtered for age 8
