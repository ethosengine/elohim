Scenario: Workplace privacy protects care economy data from employer misuse
    Given Maria participates in care economy tracking
    And this generates data about her personal life and care responsibilities
    When workplace seeks information about employees
    Then Maria's personal care economy data must be completely private
    And employers should never access her household care patterns or constraints
    And the workplace_elohim should only see work-relevant information
    And Maria's privacy should be absolute regarding personal care matters
    And care economy participation should not expose her to employer surveillance
