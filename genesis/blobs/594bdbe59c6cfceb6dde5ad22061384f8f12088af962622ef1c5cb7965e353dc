Scenario: Choosing my own timeline for crisis recovery
    Given well-meaning people have expectations about how quickly I should "move on"
    And I am recovering at my own pace
    When external pressure conflicts with my needs
    Then the Value Scanner supports my chosen timeline
    And validates that recovery is not linear
    And helps me resist pressure to rush or perform recovery
    And tracks my progress according to my goals, not external standards
    And recognizes that trauma recovery takes time
    And my personal_agent reminds me that my pace is appropriate
    And celebrates progress without imposing arbitrary milestones
    And supports my right to heal in my own way
