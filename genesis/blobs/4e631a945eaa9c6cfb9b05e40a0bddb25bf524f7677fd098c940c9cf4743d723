Scenario: Managing competing demands on personal resources
    Given Aisha has limited time and energy
    And she must balance work, self-care, and family obligations
    When Aisha plans her week in the Value Scanner
    Then the personal_agent should help her allocate care capacity
    And it should flag when she's over-committed
    And it should recognize self-care as legitimate care work
    And recommendations should support sustainable work-life balance
    And the system should help her set healthy boundaries
