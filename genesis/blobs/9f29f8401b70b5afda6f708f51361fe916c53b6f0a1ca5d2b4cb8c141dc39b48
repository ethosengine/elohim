Scenario: Educational aspirations supported through care economy networks
    Given Jasmine aspires to attend college
    And she has accumulated care tokens through years of contribution
    When she applies to colleges and seeks financial support
    Then her care contributions should support her educational transition
    And care tokens should be convertible to educational resources
    And community letters of support should reflect her demonstrated care work
    And care economy network should provide mentorship and guidance
    And her path to higher education should be supported by those she has served
    And care economy should enable educational mobility based on contribution
