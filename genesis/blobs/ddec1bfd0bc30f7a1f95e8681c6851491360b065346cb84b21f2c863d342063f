Scenario: Neighborhood cultural diversity in parenting approaches
    Given the neighborhood includes families from diverse cultures
    And different cultures have different parenting practices
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates across cultural differences
    Then it should respect diverse parenting approaches
    And it should facilitate cross-cultural learning
    And it should prevent cultural imperialism in parenting norms
    And diverse practices should be valued, not homogenized
    And neighborhood care economy should be culturally inclusive
    And the system should support multicultural community
