Scenario: Energy efficiency motivated by utility bill constraints
    Given Maria carefully manages utility costs on tight budget
    And she minimizes energy use to keep bills affordable
    When household energy consumption is tracked
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her low energy footprint
    And it should celebrate her energy efficiency as climate contribution
    And her utility management should be valued as environmental stewardship
    And economic necessity should be reframed as climate leadership
    And Maria should see her household as energy efficiency exemplar
