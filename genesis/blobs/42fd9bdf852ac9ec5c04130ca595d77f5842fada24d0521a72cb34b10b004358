Scenario: Managing workplace performance while dealing with ongoing trauma and stress
    Given I am working while still recovering from trauma
    And trauma symptoms may affect my workplace performance
    When trauma impacts my work capability
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me manage performance expectations realistically
    And provides strategies for trauma management in workplace
    And helps me access workplace mental health resources if available
    And validates that trauma affects work capacity and that's normal
    And identifies when workplace environment is retraumatizing
    And my personal_agent reminds me of coping strategies during work stress
    And recognizes that working while traumatized is extraordinarily difficult
    And supports appropriate accommodations or job changes if needed
