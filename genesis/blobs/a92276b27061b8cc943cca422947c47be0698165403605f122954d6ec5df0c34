Scenario: Creating national appellant bill of rights from precedent
    Given accumulated appeals reveal patterns of dignity violations
    And we recognize need for comprehensive framework
    When we craft detailed appellant rights precedent
    Then we enumerate: right to explanation, hearing, escalation
    And we specify: timelines, accessibility, protection from retaliation
    And we establish: precedent search, representation, dignity guarantees
    And we create: national standard for all appeal processes
    And we articulate: procedural justice as constitutional requirement
    And we strengthen: protections for future appellants nationwide
    And we fulfill: democratic promise of meaningful recourse
