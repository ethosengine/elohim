Scenario: Coordinating care across limited parental availability
    Given Sarah's work schedule limits her availability
    And Marcus manages daily household operations
    When coordination is needed between them
    Then the family_elohim should facilitate asynchronous communication
    And Sarah should be able to provide guidance during her available hours
    And Marcus should be able to request help when needed
    And the system should ensure Sarah stays informed despite time constraints
    And coordination should happen efficiently without constant interruption
    And their partnership should function despite scheduling challenges
