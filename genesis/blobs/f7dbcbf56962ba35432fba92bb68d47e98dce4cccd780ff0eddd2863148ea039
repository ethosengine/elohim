Scenario: Multi-location franchise conversion creates worker coordination opportunities
    Given James's three locations previously competed for corporate favor
    And workers at different locations didn't coordinate or support each other
    When all three locations convert to democratic EAE network simultaneously
    Then workers across locations share learning and mutual support
    And successful practices at one location spread to others
    And workers can transfer between locations while maintaining ownership stakes
    And collective bargaining power increases through multi-location coordination
    And workplace_elohim facilitates inter-location worker collaboration
