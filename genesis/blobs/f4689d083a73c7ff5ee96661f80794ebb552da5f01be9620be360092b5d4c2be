Scenario: Democratic supply chain coordination provides volume purchasing power
    Given individual farms and restaurants lack negotiating leverage with suppliers
    And corporate chains use volume to extract favorable pricing
    When democratic network coordinates purchasing across multiple entities
    Then farmers coordinate to provide consistent supply achieving volume benefits
    And restaurants coordinate orders achieving volume purchasing power
    And democratic coordination provides efficiency without extraction
    And small democratic entities match corporate scale through cooperation
