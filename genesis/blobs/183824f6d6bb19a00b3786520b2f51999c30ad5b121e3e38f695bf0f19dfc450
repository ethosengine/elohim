Scenario: Community environmental projects and collective action
    Given ecological challenges require collective response
    And Sarah participates in community environmental initiatives
    When the ecological_elohim tracks Sarah's environmental activism
    Then it should recognize organizing as ecological care work
    And it should value her participation in community environmental projects
    And activism labor should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should support parent environmental advocacy
    And Sarah's work to build sustainable community should be recognized
    And collective ecological action should be valued as care contribution
