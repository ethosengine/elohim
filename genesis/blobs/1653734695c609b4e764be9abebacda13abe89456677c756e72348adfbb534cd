Scenario: Anonymous service when facing community controversy
    Given I am reviewing a highly controversial local case
    And I am concerned about community pressure or retaliation
    When I request anonymous service protections
    Then my identity is: revealed only to verification systems
    And I can: serve without public knowing who I am
    And I am protected: from intimidation or capture attempts
    And I can: deliberate freely without fear
    And cryptographic proofs: verify I'm legitimate member without revealing identity
    And my judgment: maintains democratic legitimacy despite anonymity
