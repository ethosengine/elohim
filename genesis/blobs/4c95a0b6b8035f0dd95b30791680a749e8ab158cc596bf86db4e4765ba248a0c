Scenario: Real-world household management recognized as applied learning
    Given Marcus manages complex household operations
    And he applies math, nutrition science, planning, and resource management
    When Marcus's scanner usage is analyzed educationally
    Then his applied skills should be recognized as sophisticated learning
    And the educational system should value real-world capability
    And his household work should qualify for academic recognition
    And applied learning should be weighted alongside traditional academics
    And his competencies should be documented and credentialed
    And practical stewardship should have educational value
