Scenario: Workers develop confidence in collective decision-making
    Given workers have never governed a business democratically
    And they may doubt their capability initially
    When early democratic decisions succeed
    Then workers see their collective wisdom produces good outcomes
    And small decisions (schedule adjustments, supply orders) build confidence
    And larger decisions (pricing strategy, service expansion) follow as capacity grows
    And workplace_elohim documents successful democratic decision patterns
    And worker self-governance becomes normalized, not exceptional
