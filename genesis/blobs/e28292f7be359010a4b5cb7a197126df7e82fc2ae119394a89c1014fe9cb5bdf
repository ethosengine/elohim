Scenario: Work-life boundaries protected to prevent burnout
    Given Robert manages intense professional and care demands
    And work can expand to consume all available time
    And sustainable performance requires work-life boundaries
    When workplace_elohim monitors work-life balance
    Then it should track whether Robert maintains healthy boundaries
    And flag when work demands prevent care responsibilities
    And recognize when he's working excessive hours despite care needs
    And support him in setting professional boundaries
    And advocate for organizational norms that respect whole life
    And prevent burnout that would harm him, his family, and employer
    And demonstrate that sustainable high performance requires balance
