Scenario: Refusing treatments that prioritize normalization over flourishing
    Given medical establishment often prioritizes making disabled people "normal"
    And some treatments harm quality of life in pursuit of normalcy
    When providers recommend treatments focused on normalization
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex evaluate treatments critically
    And it should distinguish between treatments that improve Alex's life and those that pursue normalcy
    And it should support Alex in refusing treatments that don't serve Alex's goals
    And Alex's definition of quality of life should be respected
    And the protocol should recognize that disabled lives are valuable as they are
    And medical goals should align with Alex's flourishing, not societal comfort
    And Alex should be supported in rejecting medical model thinking
