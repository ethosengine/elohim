Scenario: Managing boundaries with extended family members aligned with abuser
    Given some extended family members (potentially abuser's family, some of my family) excuse or minimize abuse
    And I need to protect myself and children from these relationships
    When problematic family members attempt contact or involvement
    Then the family_elohim helps me maintain firm boundaries
    And provides language for declining contact or setting limits
    And tracks boundary violations for safety purposes
    And supports me in limiting children's contact when appropriate
    And helps me navigate family pressure to reconcile or minimize abuse
    And my personal_agent validates that protecting my household is my right
    And recognizes boundary enforcement as essential protective labor
    And supports me saying "no" to family expectations that endanger wellbeing
