Scenario: Using neighborhood public spaces independently
    Given Jordan loves visiting the nearby park
    And the park is within safe walking distance
    When Jordan wants to spend time at the park
    Then the personal_agent helps Jordan coordinate timing and safety
    And Jordan can walk to the park with appropriate support level
    And Jordan uses park facilities like any other community member
    And park neighbors see Jordan as a regular park user
    And Jordan's public space usage is a right, not a privilege
    And Jordan experiences freedom and community belonging
