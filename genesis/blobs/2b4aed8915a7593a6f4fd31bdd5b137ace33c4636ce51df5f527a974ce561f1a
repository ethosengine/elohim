Scenario: Research on superintelligence governance and democratic legitimacy
    Given my most important research question is existential
    And I study whether sortition can govern superintelligent agents
    When I analyze Constitutional Council confidence over time as agents advance
    Then I measure: council member certainty declining as agent capability increases
    And I document: increasing expert influence as complexity exceeds lay understanding
    And I identify: warning signs of democratic theater masking technocratic rule
    And I also find: hopeful pattern of councils resisting capture and demanding explainability
    And I assess: whether democratic oversight of superintelligence is possible
    And I conclude: honestly that question remains open
    And My research frames: humanity's most important governance challenge with intellectual honesty
