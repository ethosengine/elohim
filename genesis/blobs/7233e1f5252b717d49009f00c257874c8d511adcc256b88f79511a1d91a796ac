Scenario: Intergenerational care economy makes elder value visible
    Given care economy spans all ages and capabilities
    And Helen both receives and gives care
    When community care tokens are tracked
    Then Helen's lifetime contributions should be visible to community
    And her current contributions should be recognized alongside care receipt
    And younger generations should see care flowing across entire lifespan
    And the protocol should demonstrate that humans have value at all ages
    And community should learn that care reciprocity spans generations
    And success should prove that care economy values elders as full participants
    And Helen should experience community standing based on lifetime of contribution
