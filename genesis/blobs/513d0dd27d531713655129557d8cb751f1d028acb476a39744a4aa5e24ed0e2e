Scenario: Personal data privacy under Alex's complete control
    Given Alex's data includes sensitive disability and medical information
    And this data reveals intimate details about Alex's body and needs
    When data is collected about Alex's care patterns
    Then Alex must have absolute control over all data sharing
    And medical information should never be shared without explicit consent
    And disability status should be shared only when Alex chooses
    And support coordinators should access only what Alex permits
    And employers should never see medical or disability data without authorization
    And Alex's privacy must be protected with highest standards
    And data governance should respect Alex's autonomy completely
