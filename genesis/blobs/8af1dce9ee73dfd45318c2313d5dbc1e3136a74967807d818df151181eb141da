Scenario: Developer subsidy accountability reveals actual outcomes
    Given a developer received $10M state tax credit for "affordable housing"
    And claimed it would produce 200 affordable units
    When the Observer tracks subsidy outcomes
    Then analysis shows: only 35 units meet affordability criteria
    And most units are market-rate generating developer profit
    And state subsidy mostly subsidized luxury development
    And taxpayers see poor return on public investment
    And accountability creates pressure for subsidy reform
