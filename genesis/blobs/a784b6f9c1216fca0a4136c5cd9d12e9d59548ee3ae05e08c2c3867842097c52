Scenario: Developer relationship transparency creates ethical incentives
    Given a developer has made campaign donations to three council members
    And those members must vote on the developer's project
    When the Observer makes relationships visible
    Then constituents see donation patterns and voting correlations
    And the developer faces scrutiny about influence versus merit
    And council members face accountability for conflicts of interest
    And transparency creates pressure for decisions based on community benefit
    And legitimate projects must stand on merits not political relationships
