Scenario: Investor redirects capital from extractive corporations to democratic community businesses
    Given Patricia has $60K in index funds funding corporate extraction
    And she morally opposes enterprises her capital funds but lacked alternatives
    When community investment pool offers values-aligned local alternative
    Then she moves $10K from stock market to community investment in Maria's Kitchen conversion
    And capital directly funds worker ownership, not corporate extraction
    And investment aligns with values: worker dignity, community wealth, environmental stewardship
    And financial returns are fair (5% annually) while social returns are massive
    And community_elohim facilitates investment pool management and transparent reporting
