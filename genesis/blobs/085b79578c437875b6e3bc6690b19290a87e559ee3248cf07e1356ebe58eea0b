Scenario: Journalist monitors multiple school districts despite limited capacity
    Given the journalist covers regional education
    And must track 8 school districts plus state education department
    When the Observer monitors all district school boards simultaneously
    Then the journalist reviews all board meetings across districts
    And receives alerts for newsworthy decisions and patterns
    And identifies stories affecting multiple districts
    And comprehensive regional education coverage becomes sustainable
    And no consequential education decision escapes scrutiny
