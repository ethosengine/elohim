Scenario: Educational materials culturally responsive to diverse families
    Given Sarah teaches students from diverse cultural backgrounds
    And her own children are learning family cultural values
    When educational materials are designed
    Then the educational_elohim should provide culturally diverse resources
    And materials should respect different care economy traditions
    And Sarah should be able to adapt to cultural contexts
    And value literacy should be taught in culturally responsive ways
    And diverse approaches to care should be honored in education
