Scenario: End-of-life planning as family governance issue
    Given Helen is facing mortality consciously
    And her death will affect entire family
    When family discusses Helen's end-of-life wishes
    Then the family_elohim should facilitate dignity-preserving conversations
    And Helen's wishes should be documented and shared with family
    And family should understand and commit to honoring her preferences
    And emotional complexity should be supported
    And Helen's voice should be authoritative about her own death
    And family should be prepared to advocate for her wishes
    And the protocol should support family through end-of-life planning
