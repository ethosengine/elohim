Scenario: Organizer detects opportunity in school board budget priorities
    Given school board will vote on budget reallocation next month
    And proposal shifts resources away from Title I schools
    When the Observer surfaces the organizing opportunity
    Then the organizer sees equity impact analysis by school
    And identifies which parent communities are affected
    And gets breakdown of resource distribution changes
    And receives alert early enough to organize parent response
    And district budget becomes organizing opportunity for equity
