Scenario: Local food systems provide better value and freshness
    Given Marcus shops in specific geographic region
    And locally grown food can be cheaper and fresher
    When Marcus compares food options
    Then the personal_agent should identify local sources
    And it should help him access farmers' markets and local growers
    And it should explain benefits of shorter supply chains
    And local food should be framed as both economic and ecological win
    And he should learn that bioregional food systems serve his needs
    And connection to local land and farmers should develop
