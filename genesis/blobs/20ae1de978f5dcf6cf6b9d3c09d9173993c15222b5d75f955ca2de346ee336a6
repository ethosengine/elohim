Scenario: Schedule flexibility for solo parent managing complex logistics
    Given Maria coordinates three children's schools, activities, and appointments alone
    And rigid work schedules create impossible conflicts for single parents
    When Maria's work schedule is determined
    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for flexible scheduling options
    And Maria should have ability to adjust hours for critical parenting needs
    And flexibility should be policy, not personal favor requiring explanation
    And schedule should enable sustainable work-parenting integration
    And single parents should access flexibility without career penalty
