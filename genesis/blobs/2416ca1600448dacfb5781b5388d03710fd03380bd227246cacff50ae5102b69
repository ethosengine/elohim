Scenario: Neighborhood representation and voice for retirees
    Given Margaret has time to attend neighborhood meetings
    And retired residents have important perspective and needs
    When neighborhood governance decisions are made
    Then Margaret's participation and voice should be valued
    And retired residents' interests should be represented
    And her care contributions should give her standing in decisions
    And neighborhood should benefit from elder wisdom and participation
    And Margaret should help shape neighborhood policies and priorities
    And all age groups should be represented in neighborhood governance
