Scenario: Knowledge and skill sharing in student community
    Given Kenji has environmental science knowledge
    And other students have different expertise
    When students share knowledge freely
    Then the community_elohim should recognize teaching as care work
    And it should value Kenji explaining organic chemistry to struggling peer
    And it should track peer tutoring as community contribution
    And knowledge sharing should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should foster culture of generous knowledge exchange
    And intellectual support should be recognized as care labor
