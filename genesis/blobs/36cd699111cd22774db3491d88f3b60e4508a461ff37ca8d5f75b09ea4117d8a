Scenario: Teacher advocates for mental health and wellness support
    Given teaching is emotionally demanding work with high burnout
    And district provides minimal employee mental health support
    When teachers document wellness needs and impacts through Observer
    Then data shows 68% of teachers experience burnout symptoms
    And 82% say job stress affects personal life and health
    And teachers identify needed supports (counseling, reasonable workload, respect)
    And union negotiates wellness provisions in contract
    And teacher wellbeing becomes labor rights priority
