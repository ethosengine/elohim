Scenario: Neighborhood resource library for children's items
    Given children outgrow clothing, toys, and equipment rapidly
    And buying everything new is expensive and wasteful
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates resource sharing
    Then it should enable lending libraries for children's items
    And it should track who has what available to share
    And it should facilitate borrowing rather than buying
    And resource sharing should be recognized as care contribution
    And neighborhood sustainability should reduce family expenses
    And the system should enable circular economy for child-rearing
