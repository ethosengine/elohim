Scenario: Individual privacy is constitutionally protected while value is witnessed
    Given the Observer network documents workplace contributions
    And Emma prefers privacy about certain personal matters
    When Emma sets her privacy preferences
    Then work contributions are documented (with her consent)
    And personal conversations are not recorded or analyzed
    And bathroom breaks are not monitored for duration
    And her personal data (health, family, beliefs) remains sovereign
    And surveillance serves dignity protection, not corporate control
