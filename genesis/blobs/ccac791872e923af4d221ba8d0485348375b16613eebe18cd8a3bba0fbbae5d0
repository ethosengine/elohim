Scenario: Establish 10-year longitudinal study tracking protocol evolution
    Given James begins study in 2025 when protocol is newly adopted
    And he wants to understand long-term transformation effects
    When James designs the longitudinal research
    Then he selects cohort of 50 diverse communities to track
    And he recruits sample of Constitutional Council members to follow
    And he establishes baseline measurements before protocol adoption
    And he plans annual follow-up measurements for 10 years
    And he commits to capturing both positive and negative long-term effects
