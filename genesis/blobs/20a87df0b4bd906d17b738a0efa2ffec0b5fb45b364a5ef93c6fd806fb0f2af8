Scenario: Reconciling conflicting regional constitutional interpretations
    Given different regions interpreted same principle differently
    And inconsistency creates confusion and injustice
    When we provide definitive national interpretation
    Then we honor: legitimate regional diversity where appropriate
    And we establish: national minimums all regions must respect
    And we explain: which variation is constitutional and which violates
    And we create: coherence without imposing uniformity
    And we guide: regional councils with clear framework
    And we enable: coordinated governance across diverse communities
    And we demonstrate: how subsidiarity and consistency coexist
