Scenario: Snow removal and seasonal support coordinated through neighbors
    Given Helen cannot safely shovel snow or do seasonal maintenance
    And neighbors have varying capabilities and availability
    When seasonal support needs arise
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate volunteer schedules
    And neighbors should be matched to tasks based on capability
    And Helen should experience this as neighborly care, not charity
    And volunteer work should be recognized with care tokens
    And reciprocal support should be tracked across seasons
    And the protocol should coordinate practical mutual aid
    And neighborhood care economy should handle seasonal challenges
