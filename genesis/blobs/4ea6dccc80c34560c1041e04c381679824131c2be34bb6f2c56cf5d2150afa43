Scenario: Community care economy supplements for reduced household income
    Given James's household income dropped from $80k to $40k due to caregiving
    And caregiving prevents full-time employment
    When the community_elohim assesses economic support needs
    Then care token supplements should be available based on need
    And community should provide financial support recognizing care work
    And support should be dignified, not stigmatizing like charity
    And care economy should function as economic justice system
    And caregivers should not face poverty due to care contributions
