Scenario: Sarah's care contributions give her voice in municipal decisions
    Given Sarah has accumulated substantial care tokens through community work
    And municipal governance affects her family's well-being
    When municipal decisions are being made
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her legitimate standing
    And her voice should carry weight based on demonstrated care
    And municipal democracy should recognize care work as civic participation
    And those who contribute to community should influence community governance
    And care economy should create accountable municipal leadership
