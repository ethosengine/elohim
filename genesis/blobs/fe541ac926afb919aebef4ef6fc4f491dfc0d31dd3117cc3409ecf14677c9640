Scenario: Protecting Alex from workplace discrimination
    Given workplace discrimination against disabled people is common
    And ableism often operates subtly
    When potential discrimination occurs
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex identify discriminatory patterns
    And it should document incidents that might constitute discrimination
    And it should connect Alex to legal resources and advocacy support
    And patterns across time should be made visible
    And Alex should have tools to protect their workplace rights
    And the protocol should recognize that workplaces can be hostile
    And evidence collection should be systematic and thorough
