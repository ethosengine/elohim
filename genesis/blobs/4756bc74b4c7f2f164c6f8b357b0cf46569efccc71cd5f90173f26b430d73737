Scenario: Preventing work-care conflict that causes burnout
    Given Sarah faces constant conflict between work and care demands
    And this conflict drives burnout in working parents
    When the workplace_elohim monitors Sarah's situation
    Then it should detect when work-care conflicts are unsustainable
    And it should alert Sarah before burnout occurs
    And it should suggest interventions (boundaries, policy advocacy, job changes)
    And it should help Sarah maintain long-term career sustainability
    And burnout prevention should be proactive, not reactive
