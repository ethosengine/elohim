Scenario: Tracking medical care quality and provider competence
    Given medical providers vary widely in disability competence
    And poor care from ableist providers causes harm
    When Alex receives medical care
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex track care quality
    And it should document which providers respect Alex's autonomy
    And it should identify patterns of ableist treatment
    And Alex should be able to rate providers on disability competence
    And quality tracking should help Alex find better providers
    And the protocol should make provider accountability visible
    And Alex should have data to advocate for better care
