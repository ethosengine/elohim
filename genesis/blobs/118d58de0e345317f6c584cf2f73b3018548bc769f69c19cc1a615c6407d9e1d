Scenario: Appeal involves technical complexity requiring expert testimony
    Given my appeal concerns cryptographic verification of agent reasoning
    And I question whether the agent actually followed claimed constitutional principles
    When Technical Expert Dr. Amara Okonkwo testifies to the Constitutional Council
    Then she explains the cryptographic proof in accessible language
    And She clarifies what confidence levels mean and their limitations
    And She acknowledges uncertainties in the technical analysis
    And She presents competing interpretations when experts disagree
    And She informs but doesn't dictate the council's judgment
    And The council weighs technical information alongside human wisdom
    And I understand the technical basis of the decision through her explanation
