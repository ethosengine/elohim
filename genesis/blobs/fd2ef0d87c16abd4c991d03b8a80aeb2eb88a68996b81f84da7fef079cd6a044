# Agents: Economic Actors in hREA

## What is an Agent?

In hREA (Holochain REA), an Agent is any economic actor who can:
- **Provide** resources to others
- **Receive** resources from others
- **Commit** to future economic activity
- **Observe** and witness events

Agents can be individuals, organizations, or communities.

## Agent Relationships

Agents don't exist in isolation. They have relationships:

```
Agent: Adaeze (Nurse)
├── Relationships as Provider:
│   ├── Care provider → Hospital patients
│   ├── Mentor → Junior nurses
│   └── Family supporter → Okonkwo household
├── Relationships as Receiver:
│   ├── Employee ← Hospital
│   ├── Network member ← Lagos Health Collective
│   └── Learner ← Continuing education
└── Scope Memberships:
    ├── Lagos Health Collective
    ├── Ikeja Community Network
    └── Okonkwo Family
```

## Agent Capabilities in hREA

From the hREA GraphQL API, agents can:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `commitments` | Promises to provide or receive resources |
| `intents` | Desired economic activity (offers/requests) |
| `economicEvents` | Observed value flows |
| `inventoriedResources` | Resources the agent stewards |
| `proposals` | Offers to exchange value |

## Agents and Care Recognition

In a care economy, agent identity includes:
- **Care tokens accumulated**: Recognition of care work
- **Skill attestations**: Witnessed competencies
- **Creator presence**: Contributions to shared knowledge
- **Reputation**: Trust built through consistent contribution

The network sees what you create, who you help, and how you contribute.
