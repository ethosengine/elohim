Scenario: Care token standing qualifies Maria for community support without means-testing
    Given Maria has accumulated substantial care tokens from solo parenting work
    And she needs access to community resources due to resource constraints
    When Maria seeks community support
    Then her care contributions should qualify her for support with dignity
    And support should be based on demonstrated care work, not proving neediness
    And Maria should access resources as care economy participant, not charity recipient
    And community support should recognize her contributions, not pity her circumstances
    And care economy should frame assistance as reciprocity, not welfare
