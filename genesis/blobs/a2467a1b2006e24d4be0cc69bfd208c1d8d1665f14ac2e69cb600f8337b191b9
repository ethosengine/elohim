Scenario: Organizer mobilizes parents against school closure targeting low-income neighborhoods
    Given district proposes closing three schools in working-class areas
    And claims it's necessary for "efficiency"
    When the organizer uses Observer to analyze closure impacts
    Then they show closures increase commute times for low-income families
    And demonstrate stable enrollment contradicting district claims
    And calculate cost of closure to affected communities
    And organize parents to demand community-based solutions
    And education organizing prevents harm to vulnerable students
