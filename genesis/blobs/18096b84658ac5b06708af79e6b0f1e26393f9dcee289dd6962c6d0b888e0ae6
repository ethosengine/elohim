    Given company received tax incentives for job creation
    And the journalist covered initial economic development announcement
    When the Observer monitors job creation and wage outcomes
    Then the journalist finds company created 40% of promised jobs
    And sees wages are lower than promised in tax incentive agreement
    And documents tax breaks cost more than economic benefit
    And identifies lack of enforcement from economic development agency
    And publishes accountability story on corporate welfare waste
