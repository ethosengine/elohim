Scenario: Teen volunteers recognized as substantial economic contribution
    Given Jasmine volunteers 4 hours per week at community center
    And this is 16 hours per month of skilled labor
    When her volunteer work is tracked by community_elohim
    Then it should be valued at appropriate care economy rates
    And if professional childcare costs $15/hour, her care work should be valued accordingly
    And her contribution of $240/month worth of care labor should be visible
    And community institutions should recognize their dependence on her labor
    And she should accumulate care tokens reflecting this substantial contribution
    And the invisibility of teen volunteer labor should be corrected
