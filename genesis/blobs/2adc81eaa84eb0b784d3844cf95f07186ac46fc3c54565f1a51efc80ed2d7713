Scenario: Community care policy advocacy informed by personal experience
    Given Robert manages multigenerational care and work-life balance
    And he's learned what community systems help and what fails
    And policy could be improved based on his experience
    When community_elohim connects him to policy advocacy
    Then it should surface opportunities to influence care economy policy
    And help him translate personal experience into policy recommendations
    And connect him to boards, councils, and advocacy organizations
    And recognize that his voice matters because he's lived the complexity
    And support him in advocating for elder care resources, work-family policies, and care infrastructure
    And channel his accumulated wisdom toward system improvement
    And demonstrate that care economy includes policy transformation
