Scenario: Investor builds direct relationships with workers her capital supports
    Given stock market investment is anonymous and extractive
    And Patricia never met workers her capital exploited
    When community investment creates relationship opportunities
    Then she knows Maria, DeShawn, Emma—workers her investment helped liberate
    And attends stakeholder meetings learning about challenges and successes
    And workers appreciate her support without surrendering governance autonomy
    And relationship is asymmetric but not extractive (she has capital, they create value, both benefit fairly)
    And community_elohim facilitates investor-worker relationships protecting democratic governance
