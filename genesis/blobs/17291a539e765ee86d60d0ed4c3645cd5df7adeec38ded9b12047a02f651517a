Scenario: Customer participates in community food sovereignty initiatives
    Given corporate food system homogenizes diets and ignores cultural preferences
    And Ms. Johnson's community is diverse with varied cultural food traditions
    When democratic businesses respond to community cultural food needs
    Then menu includes diverse cultural options (Latino, Asian, African-American cuisines)
    And Johnson Farm grows culturally-specific produce based on community requests
    And food sovereignty increases through democratic responsiveness
    And cultural food preservation becomes community priority
    And community_elohim facilitates cultural food sovereignty programming
