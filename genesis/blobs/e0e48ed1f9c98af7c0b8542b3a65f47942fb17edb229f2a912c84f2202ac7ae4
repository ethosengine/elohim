Scenario: Farmer cooperation replaces competition through democratic coordination
    Given farmers traditionally compete for corporate contracts driving prices down
    And competition prevented coordination benefiting all farmers
    When democratic network enables farmer cooperation
    Then Tom and neighboring farms coordinate complementary production
    And crop specialization (one farm tomatoes, another greens, another roots) provides diversity
    And revenue is shared fairly based on contribution
    And farmers share equipment, labor, and expertise
    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates farmer network coordination and fair value distribution
