Scenario: Parent challenges special education service cuts
    Given the parent's child receives special education services
    And the district proposes reducing support staff "for efficiency"
    When the parent reviews Observer's analysis of legal requirements
    Then they understand federal law mandates these services
    And see which services would be cut and impacts on IEPs
    And connect with other special education parents
    And can cite specific legal protections in testimony
    And district cannot quietly violate disability rights without accountability
