Scenario: Care coordination with James's mother while caring for David
    Given James's mother (76) needs increasing support
    And James is already overwhelmed caring for David
    When James coordinates care for his mother
    Then the family_elohim should help him manage both relationships
    And it should recognize he cannot provide intensive care in both directions
    And it should help coordinate additional support for his mother
    And it should prevent James from collapsing under dual burden
    And family care should be sustainable across multiple recipients
