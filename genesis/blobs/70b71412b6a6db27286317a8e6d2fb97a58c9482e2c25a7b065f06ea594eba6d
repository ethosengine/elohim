Scenario: Sibling care relationships built through value recognition
    Given Tommy regularly selects items for his sister Emma
    And Emma is 7 years old
    When Tommy makes care contributions targeting Emma
    Then the family_elohim should track sibling care patterns
    And positive feedback loops should be created
    And Tommy's personal_agent should reference past successes: "Emma loved the strawberries you picked last time"
    And Emma should be prompted to recognize Tommy's care
    And sibling relationships should be based on mutual care, not competition
    And the protocol should build family bonds through care visibility
