Scenario: Local economic cooperation for service cost reduction
    Given Maria struggles to afford household services on limited income
    And neighbors might coordinate for collective cost reduction
    When neighborhood members need similar services
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate group contracting
    And collective service hiring should reduce costs for all participants
    And Maria should access affordable household services through cooperation
    And neighborhood economic coordination should address resource constraints
    And single parents should benefit from collective bargaining power
