Scenario: Income replacement through care economy when employment impossible
    Given James's income dropped from $80k to $40k due to caregiving
    And he may eventually be unable to work at all
    When employment becomes impossible
    Then the workplace_elohim should document care work value
    And care token accumulation should provide income replacement
    And care economy should recognize professional-grade family care
    And James should have economic support if employment ends
    And care contributions should provide economic standing
