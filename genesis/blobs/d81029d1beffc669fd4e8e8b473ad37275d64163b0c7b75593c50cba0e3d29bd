Scenario: Access to global appeal precedent database
    Given Marcus wants to understand how similar appeals were resolved globally
    When Marcus searches the global constitutional precedent database
    Then he finds anonymized cases from dozens of countries
    And he sees how different cultures interpret privacy versus care
    And he understands constitutional reasoning across contexts
    And he can cite global precedent in his own appeal
    And he learns his case is not isolated but part of human pattern
    And the database empowers appellants worldwide with shared knowledge
