Scenario: Coordinating care across multiple generations simultaneously
    Given Sarah provides care to her children, her partner, and increasingly to her parents
    And she is in the sandwich generation
    When the family_elohim tracks care flows
    Then it should map care moving upward to parents
    And it should track care downward to children
    And it should recognize care inward for Sarah's own well-being
    And it should value care outward to community
    And Sarah should see the full complexity of her care work
    And multi-generational care patterns should be visible
