Scenario: Understanding water usage in food production
    Given food production uses significant water resources
    And water scarcity is increasing
    When the bioregional_elohim displays environmental data
    Then it should include water usage in impact assessment
    And it should explain water costs of different foods
    And it should help her choose lower water-impact options
    And bioregional water context should inform recommendations
    And she should understand food-water connections
