Scenario: Farm labor practices improve through worker democratic control
    Given Tom paid farmworkers as well as possible but margins were thin
    And workers lacked voice in schedule, breaks, safety, or working conditions
    When farmworkers gain democratic ownership and governance
    Then wages increase to $18/hour minimum from increased farm revenue (direct sales, fair pricing)
    And work schedules accommodate workers' family and health needs
    And safety equipment and protocols improve through worker input
    And agricultural labor transforms from exploited work to dignified livelihood
    And workplace_elohim ensures democratic governance protects farmworker dignity
