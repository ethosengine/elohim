Scenario: Journalist monitors labor board and regulatory hearings
    Given the journalist covers labor and employment
    And must track labor board, wage enforcement, OSHA, and related agencies
    When the Observer monitors all labor regulatory agencies
    Then the journalist reviews all violation cases and enforcement actions
    And receives alerts for significant labor violations
    And tracks patterns in enforcement and employer violations
    And comprehensive labor accountability coverage becomes sustainable
    And worker exploitation cannot hide in regulatory obscurity
