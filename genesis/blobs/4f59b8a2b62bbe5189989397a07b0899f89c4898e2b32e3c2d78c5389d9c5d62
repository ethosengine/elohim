Scenario: Household privacy protected from external surveillance
    Given household care economy generates detailed living pattern data
    And this data reveals intimate household dynamics
    When household data is collected
    Then it must remain under household members' control
    And no external entities should access household data without consent
    And community organizations should only see what's shared
    And family should respect household privacy boundaries
    And healthcare providers should only access consented information
    And household privacy should be absolutely protected
