Scenario: Planning commissioner understands environmental justice dimensions of industrial permit
    Given commission evaluates permit for industrial facility citing pollution
    And facility meets regulatory standards according to staff analysis
    And community members testify about existing pollution burden but lack data
    When the commissioner seeks environmental justice analysis from Observer
    Then they receive cumulative pollution exposure data for affected neighborhood
    And see demographics showing low-income community of color already overburdened
    And access health outcome data correlating with pollution exposure
    And discover neighborhood has multiple polluting facilities unlike affluent areas
    And environmental justice analysis reveals disparate impacts standard permitting ignores
