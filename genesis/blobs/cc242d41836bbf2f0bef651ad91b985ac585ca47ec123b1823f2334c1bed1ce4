Scenario: Contributing to national appellant bill of rights implementation
    Given National Council established detailed appellant rights
    And technical implementation is needed
    When I help design systems supporting these rights
    Then I specify: technical requirements for appeal interfaces
    And I design: precedent search and tracking systems
    And I ensure: accessibility for users with disabilities
    And I implement: privacy protections for sensitive appeals
    And I test: that systems actually serve appellant rights
    And I demonstrate: technical development implementing constitutional values
