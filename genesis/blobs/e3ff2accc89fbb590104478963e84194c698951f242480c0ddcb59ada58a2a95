Scenario: Municipal data privacy protects residents while enabling planning
    Given municipal care economy involves data about many residents
    And privacy must be rigorously protected
    When municipal planning uses care economy data
    Then the municipal_elohim should only provide aggregated anonymized data
    And no individual household should be identifiable
    And Sarah's privacy should be absolute unless she chooses disclosure
    And municipal benefits should not require privacy sacrifice
    And data governance should be transparent and accountable
