Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Adult
  As an adult in prime working/parenting years (ages 26-45)
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want my personal choices and care contributions to be recognized
  So that I can maintain my own flourishing while caring for others

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the adult user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah is 34 years old
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Sarah's personal_agent is configured for complexity management
    And Sarah is mother of Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And Sarah works full-time as a teacher

  Scenario: Personal agent serves as cognitive partner for overwhelming complexity
    Given Sarah is managing multiple care contexts simultaneously
    And Sarah is planning Tuesday evening meals
    And she must coordinate children's developmental needs, budget, allergies, schedule, and community obligations
    When Sarah opens the Value Scanner
    Then her personal_agent should present integrated complexity overview
    And the agent should surface conflicts before they become crises
    And it should suggest solutions balancing competing needs
    And it should track factors Sarah can't hold simultaneously
    And Sarah should experience genuine cognitive partnership
    And the agent should reduce mental load, not add to it

  Scenario: Maintaining personal flourishing under care responsibilities
    Given Sarah has been prioritizing everyone else's needs
    And her personal_agent monitors her well-being patterns
    And Sarah's nutrition, exercise, and social connection are declining
    When two weeks pass without self-care
    Then the personal_agent should recognize unsustainable sacrifice
    And it should prompt "You've prioritized everyone else's needs for two weeks—what would support your flourishing?"
    And it should frame self-care as essential stewardship, not selfishness
    And it should recognize that care for self enables care for others
    And Sarah should receive support in maintaining her own capacity

  Scenario: Adult exercises full autonomy over life decisions
    Given Sarah has competing demands on her time and resources
    And she must balance professional work, parenting, partnership, and self-care
    When Sarah makes decisions about resource allocation
    Then she should have complete autonomy over her choices
    And her personal_agent should provide decision support without manipulation
    And she should maintain full decision-making authority
    And the protocol should serve her values, not impose external priorities
    And her agency should be respected as a competent adult

  Scenario: Recognition of invisible care labor in personal identity
    Given Sarah performs enormous amounts of invisible care work
    And traditional economics don't recognize meal planning, schedule management, emotional labor
    When Sarah reviews her care contributions
    Then the Value Scanner should make all care labor visible
    And her personal_agent should quantify meal planning, shopping, cooking, coordination, kin-keeping
    And care tokens should accumulate reflecting her actual contributions
    And Sarah's self-understanding should shift from "not working" to "performing essential care labor"
    And visibility should transform how Sarah sees herself

  Scenario: Personal data privacy under adult's complete control
    Given Sarah's care contributions generate detailed personal data
    And this data reveals intimate patterns of her life
    When Sarah's data is collected and stored
    Then she must have complete control over all data sharing
    And she should decide what partner sees, what children see, what community sees
    And workplace should never access personal care economy data
    And her privacy must be absolute unless she chooses to share
    And she should manage family members' privacy while maintaining oversight of children

  Scenario: Personal agent prevents burnout through proactive monitoring
    Given Sarah is at high risk for burnout
    And she tends to sacrifice herself unsustainably
    When her personal_agent detects warning signs
    Then it should watch for nutrition suffering, exercise disappearing, social connection eroding
    And it should proactively surface help options before crisis
    And it should connect Sarah to community support resources
    And it should recognize that her capacity to care depends on her well-being
    And intervention should be timely, dignified, and effective

  Scenario: Adult's complex scheduling requires sophisticated coordination
    Given Sarah manages professional schedule, children's schedules, household tasks, community commitments
    And conflicts arise constantly
    When Sarah plans her week
    Then the personal_agent should integrate with calendars, school systems, work tools
    And it should identify scheduling conflicts automatically
    And it should suggest realistic solutions within constraints
    And it should coordinate across family members' needs
    And scheduling should support Sarah's effectiveness, not overwhelm her

  Scenario: Personal financial management integrated with care economy
    Given Sarah manages household finances on $65k/year combined income
    And budgeting is complex across multiple care contexts
    When Sarah makes purchasing decisions
    Then her personal_agent should track budget in real-time
    And it should integrate financial constraints with nutritional needs, developmental appropriateness, family values
    And it should help Sarah make informed trade-offs
    And financial tools should serve care economy goals, not just spending tracking
    And budget management should feel supportive, not restrictive

  Scenario: Adult learns to recognize and value her own care contributions
    Given Sarah has internalized that parenting is "not working"
    And society devalues the care labor she performs
    When Sarah uses the Value Scanner over time
    Then she should develop new understanding of her contributions
    And she should see meal planning, emotional labor, household coordination as valuable work
    And quantified care contributions should shift her self-concept
    And she should gain language to articulate her care work to others
    And cultural transformation should begin with Sarah's own understanding

  Scenario: Personal agent adapts to Sarah's individual values and culture
    Given Sarah has specific cultural background and personal values
    And her family has chosen value frameworks
    When the personal_agent provides guidance
    Then it should align with Sarah's cultural context
    And it should respect her personal value priorities
    And it should serve her chosen framework, not impose external values
    And diverse cultural approaches to care should be honored
    And the protocol should be culturally adaptive, not prescriptive

  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained with full data portability
    Given Sarah has been using the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Sarah chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then the system must honor disconnection immediately
    And she should receive complete data export of all her information
    And no manipulative retention patterns should be employed
    And her right to not participate must be absolute
    And data portability should enable switching to alternative systems

  Scenario: Personal crisis support provides immediate dignified assistance
    Given Sarah encounters a crisis—job loss, health emergency, family breakdown
    And she needs immediate support
    When the personal_agent detects crisis indicators
    Then it should connect her to appropriate resources immediately
    And support should be dignified, not stigmatizing
    And she should access community mutual aid networks
    And crisis response should be effective under extreme stress
    And the protocol should function as safety net during vulnerability
