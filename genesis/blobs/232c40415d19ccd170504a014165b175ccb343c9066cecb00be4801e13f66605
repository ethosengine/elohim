    Given city purchases goods and services from private vendors
    And public procurement can support democratic economy development
    When investors advocate for democratic business procurement preferences
    Then municipal contracts give priority to worker-owned businesses
    And Patricia's investments benefit from stable public sector demand
    And taxpayer money supports living wages and democratic governance
    And procurement policy demonstrates municipal commitment to economic democracy
    And municipality_elohim tracks democratic business procurement and impacts
