Scenario: Research on national appeal patterns informs my case
    Given Dr. Chen has analyzed thousands of national appeals
    And his research identifies patterns I should know about
    When I prepare my national-level appeal
    Then I can access research findings about success factors
    And I understand which constitutional arguments have prevailed
    And I see where protocol improvements emerged from appeals
    And I learn from anonymized cases similar to mine
    And Research democratizes knowledge of how to appeal effectively
    And My appeal benefits from collective learning across appellants
    And Individual justice and systemic knowledge work together
