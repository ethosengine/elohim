    Given Sarah is raising Tommy and Emma in care economy framework
    And she wants them to understand family care relationships
    When Sarah teaches children about family care
    Then the family_elohim should support value literacy education
    And children should learn that grandparents' help is valuable work
    And they should understand that Sarah cares for her parents too
    And they should see care as reciprocal across generations
    And the next generation should internalize care economy principles
    And family culture should be transformed through children's education
