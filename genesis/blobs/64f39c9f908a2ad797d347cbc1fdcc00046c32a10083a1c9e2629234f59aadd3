Scenario: Teaching healthy boundary-setting and self-advocacy
    Given Aisha needs to learn professional and personal boundaries
    And boundary-setting is rarely taught explicitly
    When the personal_agent provides guidance
    Then it should teach how to set healthy boundaries
    And it should model self-advocacy language and approaches
    And it should help her recognize when boundaries are needed
    And the system should educate about sustainable capacity management
    And she should learn that boundaries enable sustainable care
    And self-advocacy should be taught as essential life skill
