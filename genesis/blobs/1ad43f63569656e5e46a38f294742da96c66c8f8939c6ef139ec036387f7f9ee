Feature: Workplace Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver
  As a caregiver navigating employment while providing intensive care
  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer
  I want workplace systems that recognize and accommodate caregiving realities
  So that caregivers can maintain employment without choosing between work and care

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the caregiver user "James" is registered in the system
    And James works part-time (~20 hours/week) as IT contractor
    And James provides intensive care for David with early-onset Alzheimer's
    And caregiving severely limits James's work capacity
    And the workplace governance context is active
    And the workplace_elohim advocates for caregiver needs
    And James's employment is precarious due to caregiving demands

  Scenario: Workplace recognition of caregiver constraints on employment
    Given James can only work ~20 hours/week due to caregiving
    And his availability is constrained by care needs
    When the workplace_elohim communicates with employers
    Then James's caregiving situation should be visible to employer
    And his reduced availability should be explained as care-related
    And employer should understand caregiving constraints on capacity
    And caregiver status should be recognized as legitimate limit
    And workplace should accommodate caregiving realities

  Scenario: Flexible scheduling enables caregiving and employment simultaneously
    Given James's caregiving demands vary unpredictably
    And rigid schedules would make employment impossible
    When James negotiates work arrangements
    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for flexibility
    And scheduling should accommodate caregiving emergencies
    And James should be able to work around care demands
    And flexibility should be policy, not just employer goodwill
    And workplace should recognize caregivers need scheduling flexibility

  Scenario: Remote work essential for caregiver employment viability
    Given James cannot leave David alone for commuting and full workdays
    And remote work makes part-time employment possible
    When employment arrangements are structured
    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for remote work access
    And remote work should be recognized as caregiving accommodation
    And employers should understand caregivers depend on remote options
    And workplace should support remote work for caregiving employees
    And location flexibility should be caregiving accessibility issue

  Scenario: Caregiver leave policies protect employment during crises
    Given caregiving crises occur unpredictably
    And James may need to take sudden leave for David's care
    When the workplace_elohim advocates for leave policies
    Then caregiver leave should be available like parental leave
    And leave should be protected employment, not termination risk
    And James should access leave without penalty
    And workplace should recognize adult care like child care
    And caregiver leave should be employment protection

  Scenario: Part-time employment with full benefits for caregivers
    Given James can only work part-time due to caregiving
    And loss of benefits creates devastating vulnerability
    When the workplace_elohim advocates for benefits policy
    Then part-time caregiver employees should access benefits
    And healthcare coverage should not require full-time employment
    And benefits should recognize caregiving as legitimate constraint
    And workplace should not force caregivers to choose between care and benefits
    And employment protection should include part-time caregivers

  Scenario: Workplace understanding prevents caregiver discrimination
    Given caregivers often face employment discrimination
    And James might be seen as less committed or reliable
    When the workplace_elohim monitors for discrimination
    Then it should recognize caregiver discrimination patterns
    And it should educate employers about caregiver rights
    And it should advocate when James faces unfair treatment
    And workplace should not penalize caregiving responsibilities
    And caregiver status should be protected like other statuses

  Scenario: Career trajectory protection despite reduced hours
    Given James's career has been derailed by caregiving
    And years of part-time work affects future employment
    When the workplace_elohim tracks career impact
    Then caregiving years should be recognized as valuable experience
    And James's skills should be valued despite reduced hours
    And career gaps should be explained as caregiving, not lack of ambition
    And future employers should understand caregiver career patterns
    And workplace should not permanently penalize caregiving years

  Scenario: Income replacement through care economy when employment impossible
    Given James's income dropped from $80k to $40k due to caregiving
    And he may eventually be unable to work at all
    When employment becomes impossible
    Then the workplace_elohim should document care work value
    And care token accumulation should provide income replacement
    And care economy should recognize professional-grade family care
    And James should have economic support if employment ends
    And care contributions should provide economic standing

  Scenario: Employer education about caregiver employee realities
    Given employers often don't understand caregiver demands
    And ignorance leads to policies that exclude caregivers
    When the workplace_elohim advocates for caregiver employees
    Then it should educate employers about caregiving intensity
    And it should demonstrate caregivers are valuable employees
    And it should show accommodation benefits retention
    And employers should understand caregiving as widespread need
    And workplace culture should become caregiver-friendly

  Scenario: Professional development access despite caregiving constraints
    Given James wants to maintain professional skills
    And caregiving prevents traditional professional development
    When professional development is offered
    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for accessible formats
    And training should be available remotely and asynchronously
    And caregivers should not be excluded from advancement opportunities
    And professional growth should be possible during caregiving years
    And workplace should provide flexible development paths

  Scenario: Caregiver employee resource groups provide peer support
    Given James is isolated from professional community by caregiving
    And connection to other caregiver employees would help
    When the workplace_elohim organizes caregiver support
    Then employee resource groups should include caregivers
    And caregiver employees should connect with each other
    And workplace should facilitate caregiver peer support
    And professional isolation should be reduced through connection
    And caregivers should have voice in workplace policy

  Scenario: Documentation of care work value for future employment
    Given James's care work develops valuable professional skills
    And years of family caregiving should count as experience
    When the workplace_elohim documents James's care work
    Then it should quantify care contributions professionally
    And care skills should be framed as professional development
    And documentation should support future employment applications
    And family caregiving should be recognized as professional experience
    And care economy should translate to employment economy value
