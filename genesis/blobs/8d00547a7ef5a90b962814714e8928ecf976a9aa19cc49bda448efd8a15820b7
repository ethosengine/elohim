Scenario: Journalist investigates regional transit inequity
    Given transit access varies dramatically across metropolitan area
    And the journalist covers regional transit authority
    When the Observer analyzes transit service distribution
    Then the journalist sees frequent service to employment centers from white suburbs
    And finds infrequent service in communities of color despite higher ridership
    And documents decades of investment decisions favoring certain areas
    And compares stated equity goals to actual funding allocation
    And publishes accountability story on transit racism
