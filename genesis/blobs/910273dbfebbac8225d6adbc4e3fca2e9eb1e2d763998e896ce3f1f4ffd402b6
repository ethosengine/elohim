Scenario: Advocating for elder-friendly community policies
    Given Margaret represents retired community members' interests
    And community policies affect elder well-being and participation
    When community considers policies on housing, transportation, or services
    Then Margaret's voice and advocacy should be valued
    And her care contributions should give her standing in decisions
    And elder perspective should inform community planning
    And age-friendly policies should be prioritized
    And community should serve members of all ages
    And Margaret should help shape community for aging population
