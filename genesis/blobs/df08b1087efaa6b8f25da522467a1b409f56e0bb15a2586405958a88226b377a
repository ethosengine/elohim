Scenario: Medical provider education about caregiver as care partner
    Given some providers dismiss or ignore family caregivers
    And this undermines care quality and caregiver well-being
    When the healthcare_elohim advocates for caregiver role
    Then it should educate providers about caregiver expertise
    And it should demonstrate caregivers improve care outcomes
    And it should advocate for caregiver partnership in care teams
    And providers should be trained to work with family caregivers
    And healthcare culture should recognize caregivers as essential partners
