Scenario: Learning about local and seasonal food choices
    Given local and seasonal food has lower environmental impact
    And Aisha is learning about bioregional food systems
    When Aisha shops for produce
    Then the bioregional_elohim should highlight local options
    And it should explain seasonal availability
    And it should teach about her bioregion's food production
    And local food choices should be encouraged when affordable
    And she should learn her region's agricultural patterns
    And bioregional food literacy should develop
