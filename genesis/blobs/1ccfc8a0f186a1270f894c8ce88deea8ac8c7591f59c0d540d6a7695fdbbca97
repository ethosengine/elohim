Scenario: Activist monitors multiple municipal bodies simultaneously
    Given the activist's issue spans city council, planning commission, and housing authority
    And attending all meetings is physically impossible
    When the Observer monitors all civic bodies
    Then the activist receives alerts for relevant agenda items
    And sees summaries of decisions across all bodies
    And identifies coordination opportunities across agencies
    And sustainable multi-body surveillance becomes possible
    And activist capacity multiplies through automation
