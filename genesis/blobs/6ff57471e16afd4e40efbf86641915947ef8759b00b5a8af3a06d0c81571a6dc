Scenario: Manager coordinates customer feedback without targeting individuals
    Given customers provide feedback about service and quality
    And corporate model had Marcus use feedback to discipline workers
    When customer feedback arrives
    Then Marcus aggregates patterns without targeting individuals
    And Marcus presents feedback trends to worker council
    And workers discuss how to address systemic issues collaboratively
    And individual worker incidents are handled through peer process, not manager discipline
    And workplace_elohim prevents feedback from becoming surveillance weapon
