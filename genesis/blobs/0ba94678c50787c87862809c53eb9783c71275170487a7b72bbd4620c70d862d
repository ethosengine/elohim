Scenario: Farm employment provides community economic opportunity with dignity
    Given local employment often means low-wage service jobs without advancement
    And agricultural work is typically exploited and underpaid
    When democratic farm offers dignified employment with ownership pathway
    Then community members gain living-wage agricultural employment ($18/hour minimum)
    And employment includes training, ownership potential, and democratic voice
    And youth employment programs connect young people to agriculture
    And farm becomes community economic development asset
