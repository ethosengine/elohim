Scenario: Multi-store comparison for budget optimization
    Given Aisha's limited budget requires strategic shopping
    And different stores offer different value propositions
    When Aisha compares shopping options
    Then the personal_agent should analyze prices across stores
    And it should consider transportation costs in calculations
    And it should identify where spending more saves money long-term
    And recommendations should optimize total value, not just price
    And the system should help her find efficiency frontiers
    And decision support should build financial literacy
