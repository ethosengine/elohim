Scenario: Random selection to Global Constitutional Convention
    Given the 7-year Global Constitutional Convention is convening
    And 10,000 citizens will be randomly selected from all humanity
    When I receive notification of my global selection
    Then I am chosen: via stratified global sortition
    And I will serve: 6-month term with citizens from every nation
    And I will deliberate: on constitutional amendments and existential questions
    And I will help: shape governance for superintelligent AI
    And I am supported: with full resources, translation, travel
    And I feel: overwhelming responsibility and honor
    And I understand: I am representing all humanity in democratic choice
