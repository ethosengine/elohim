Scenario: Citizen tracks environmental commitment implementation
    Given the city adopted a climate action plan two years ago
    And promised specific sustainability measures
    When the citizen reviews Observer tracking
    Then they see which commitments have been implemented
    And which remain unfulfilled promises
    And view progress on measurable sustainability goals
    And can hold officials accountable for climate action
    And long-term environmental policy gets institutional memory
