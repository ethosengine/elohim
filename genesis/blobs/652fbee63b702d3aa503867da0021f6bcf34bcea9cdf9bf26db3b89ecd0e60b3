Scenario: Journalist tracks neighborhood promises over time
    Given city officials promised park improvements at community meeting
    And the journalist covers 12 neighborhoods with similar promises
    When the Observer monitors promise implementation across neighborhoods
    Then the journalist receives alert that 18 months have passed
    And sees park still unimproved despite promise
    And identifies pattern of broken promises in communities of color
    And publishes accountability story on systematic neglect
    And institutional memory prevents promises from being forgotten
