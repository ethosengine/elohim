Scenario: School events and volunteer expectations account for single parent constraints
    Given schools often expect parent participation in events and volunteering
    And Maria has severe time and energy constraints as solo working parent
    When schools set participation expectations
    Then the educational_elohim should make visible single parents' realistic capacity
    And schools should not penalize children whose single parents cannot volunteer extensively
    And limited participation should not reflect on children's family or parent's commitment
    And schools should recognize some parents are managing heroically just to survive
    And Maria's children should not suffer because she cannot match two-parent family participation
