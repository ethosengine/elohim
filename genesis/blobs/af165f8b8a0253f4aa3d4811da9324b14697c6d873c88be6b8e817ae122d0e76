Scenario: Coordinating children's basic needs amid housing instability
    Given I am in transitional housing with uncertain future
    And my children need stability, routine, and predictability
    When I plan daily and weekly household operations
    Then the Value Scanner helps me maintain consistency where possible
    And tracks children's schedules, needs, and preferences
    And helps me create portable routines that work across housing changes
    And surfaces strategies for stability even in unstable circumstances
    And coordinates meal planning with catastrophically limited budget
    And my personal_agent reminds me of important household tasks
    And recognizes my household management as substantial care work
    And celebrates the stability I'm providing under impossible conditions
