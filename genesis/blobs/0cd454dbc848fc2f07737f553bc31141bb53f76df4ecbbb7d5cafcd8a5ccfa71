Scenario: Mentoring younger volunteers in construction and community work
    Given Frank has both construction expertise and volunteering experience
    And younger volunteers need skill development and guidance
    When the community_elohim coordinates mentoring
    Then it should connect Frank to volunteers seeking construction skills
    And facilitate teaching and skill transmission
    And recognize mentoring as multiplying Frank's contribution
    And value teaching labor as care contribution
    And build community capacity through intergenerational skill sharing
    And Frank should experience meaningful role as mentor and teacher
