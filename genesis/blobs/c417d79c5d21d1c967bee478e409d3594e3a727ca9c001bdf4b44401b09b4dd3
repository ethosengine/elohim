**Narrative:** Imagine a bustling digital marketplace of faith. Millions of Christians gather daily, seeking inspiration, connection, and spiritual nourishment. They share prayers, verses, and testimonies. They debate theology and celebrate miracles. This vibrant online community seems to embody the global, interconnected Body of Christ that we've long envisioned.  
But there's a sobering reality behind this facade.  
In 2019, a shocking investigation revealed that 19 out of the top 20 Christian Facebook pages weren't run by devout believers, earnest ministries, or even well-meaning if misguided prosperity preachers. Instead, these pages – reaching tens of millions of faithful followers – were operated by foreign click farms, primarily based in Kosovo and Macedonia.  
Let that sink in. The vast majority of "Christian" content engaging your family, friends, and fellow church members was created not to edify, but to exploit.  
These click farms recognized a lucrative opportunity in the faith community. They understood that Christians are often trusting, eager to engage with spiritual content, and quick to share messages that resonate with their beliefs. By generating and spreading content that appealed to Christian sensibilities – often with a healthy dose of political outrage – these operators could drive massive engagement, translating into substantial advertising revenue.  
The content itself ranged from benign inspirational quotes (often misattributed) to more insidious misinformation designed to stoke fear and division within the Christian community. Regardless of the specific message, the true purpose was always the same: to capture and monetize the attention of believers.  
This revelation should shake us to our core. As Christians, we're called to be people of truth, integrity, and discernment. Yet here we were, unwittingly promoting and spreading content created by those who saw our faith not as a transformative truth, but as a profitable demographic to be exploited.  
Moreover, this situation reveals how our genuine desire for spiritual connection and growth can be weaponized against us in the attention economy. Every share, every comment, every moment spent engaging with this fraudulent content not only lined the pockets of unscrupulous operators but also drowned out authentic Christian voices and ministries trying to make a real impact.  
The implications run deeper still. How many believers have had their understanding of Christianity subtly warped by this steady stream of algorithmically optimized pseudo-faith? How has this distorted the wider world's perception of what Christianity stands for? And how has this contributed to the polarization and tribalism we see both within the Church and in our broader society?  
As followers of Christ, we're called to be "wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16). This situation demands that we reclaim that wisdom, exercising critical discernment in our digital lives. We must recognize that our attention – our most precious resource – is being systematically extracted and exploited, often at the expense of our spiritual well-being and our witness to the world.  
This is not just about being more careful on social media. This is a call to radically reevaluate our relationship with digital platforms and to take an active role in shaping a more authentic, more humane online ecosystem. It's a challenge to create and cultivate digital spaces that truly reflect the values of our faith – spaces that prioritize truth, foster genuine community, and point towards Christ rather than clickbait.  
As we confront this reality, let's allow our righteous anger to fuel positive action. Let's commit to being more discerning consumers and more responsible sharers of content. Let's support authentic Christian voices and ministries in the digital space. And for those of us with the skills and influence to do so, let's lead the charge in creating technology that serves the genuine needs of the faith community rather than exploiting them.  
The integrity of our digital discipleship and the authenticity of our online witness hang in the balance. It's time to reclaim our attention, our platforms, and our very understanding of what it means to be the Church in the digital age.
