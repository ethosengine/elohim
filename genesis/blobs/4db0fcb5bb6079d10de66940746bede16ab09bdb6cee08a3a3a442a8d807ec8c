Scenario: Receiving family financial support with dignity
    Given Kenji receives some financial support from family
    And traditional economics treats this as dependency or charity
    When the family_elohim tracks family resource flows
    Then it should frame financial support as family care investment
    And it should recognize that families invest in young members' development
    And it should help Kenji receive support without shame
    And it should track this as reciprocal care economy, not dependency
    And the system should value family investment in student development
    And receiving family support should be dignified participation in family economy
