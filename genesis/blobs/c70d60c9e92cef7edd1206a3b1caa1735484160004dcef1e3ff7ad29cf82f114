Scenario: Building cross-disability solidarity across different disability communities
    Given disability community includes diverse disabilities and experiences
    And Alex works to build solidarity across different disability groups
    When Alex bridges different disability communities
    Then coalition-building should be recognized as sophisticated care work
    And the community_elohim should value solidarity-building labor
    And connecting different disability experiences strengthens whole community
    And Alex's bridge-building accumulates care tokens
    And the protocol should recognize that unity requires intentional work
    And cross-community organizing should be appropriately valued
    And Alex's solidarity work strengthens collective power for justice
