Scenario: Passive solar and natural ventilation in building design
    Given Frank has construction experience with building orientation and design
    And passive solar and ventilation reduce energy consumption
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates sustainable building
    Then it should facilitate passive design elements in Habitat projects
    And help Frank apply climate-appropriate building techniques
    And recognize building design knowledge as ecological expertise
    And quantify energy savings from passive design choices
    And teach sustainable design principles to younger builders
    And Frank's knowledge should serve low-energy building practices
