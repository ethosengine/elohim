Scenario: Workers respond to community crisis with mutual aid
    Given neighborhood experiences crisis (fire, flood, or emergency)
    And community members need food and gathering space
    When workers learn of community crisis
    Then workers immediately open ChickenMax for community support
    And workers provide free meals to affected community members
    And workers coordinate with community_elohim for broader support network
    And workers demonstrate solidarity through material aid
    And community reciprocates support when workers need it
