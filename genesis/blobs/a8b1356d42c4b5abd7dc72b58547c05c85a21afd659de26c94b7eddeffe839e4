Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Child
  As a child in the value scanner system
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to understand how my choices connect to community patterns
  So that I learn care economy operates beyond just my family

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the child user "Emma" is registered in the system
    And Emma is 8 years old
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And Emma's family participates in neighborhood care economy
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates community patterns
    And Emma is beginning to engage beyond family context

  Scenario: Child learns individual choices aggregate to community patterns
    Given Emma makes consistent purchasing choices
    And other neighborhood families also use the Value Scanner
    When Emma's personal_agent provides context about her choices
    Then the agent should share age-appropriate community insights
    And the agent should say "Five other families bought this brand this week—they're all trying to eat healthier"
    And Emma should learn her choices are part of larger patterns
    And she should understand individual agency connects to collective outcomes
    And community context should expand her economic understanding
    And she should see herself as part of care economy ecosystem

  Scenario: Neighborhood shopping patterns affect local product availability
    Given Emma shops at local grocery store
    And the store stocks products based on community demand
    When Emma consistently chooses certain products
    Then she should learn her choices influence what stores carry
    And her personal_agent should explain "When families buy local produce, stores stock more of it"
    And Emma should understand demand shapes supply at community level
    And she should see connection between individual choice and collective power
    And economic literacy should include understanding market dynamics
    And she should learn communities shape local economies

  Scenario: Child recognizes care labor in neighborhood economy
    Given Emma interacts with store workers during shopping
    And she is learning to see invisible care work
    When Emma completes a transaction
    Then her personal_agent should prompt recognition of care labor
    And the agent should say "Thank the checker for scanning your items"
    And Emma should learn to see stockers, checkers, farmers, truckers
    And she should understand economy is made of people caring for each other
    And awareness of care labor should extend beyond family
    And she should be socialized into seeing economy as care relationships

  Scenario: Neighborhood care economy connects families across community
    Given multiple families in neighborhood participate in Value Scanner
    And Emma's family is part of neighborhood network
    When Emma makes care contributions through shopping
    Then her contributions should feed into neighborhood care economy
    And the neighborhood_elohim should track community care patterns
    And Emma should learn care extends beyond her household
    And she should see her family as part of larger community
    And neighborhood-level recognition should be age-appropriate
    And community belonging should be built through care visibility

  Scenario: Child learns about local food systems through scanner
    Given Emma's neighborhood has local farmers and producers
    And the Value Scanner highlights local sourcing
    When Emma scans locally-produced items
    Then her personal_agent should explain local food systems
    And the agent should say "This was grown by farmers just 20 miles away"
    And Emma should learn about supply chains at concrete level
    And she should understand connection between her food and local land
    And regional care economies should be made visible
    And she should develop sense of place-based economic relationships

  Scenario: Community-level insights appropriate for child understanding
    Given neighborhood_elohim aggregates community data
    And Emma is old enough to understand patterns
    When Emma receives neighborhood-level information
    Then insights should be concrete and age-appropriate
    And the agent should say "Your neighborhood buys a lot of fresh vegetables"
    And abstract data should not be presented
    And community patterns should be framed in care terms
    And Emma should learn about collective behavior through simple examples
    And complexity should be appropriately filtered for age 8

  Scenario: Child's care contributions visible at neighborhood scale
    Given Emma makes consistent stewardship choices
    And neighborhood care economy tracks contributions
    When Emma's patterns are recognized by neighborhood_elohim
    Then her contributions should be visible at appropriate scale
    And recognition should reflect community-level impact
    And Emma should learn her care matters beyond just family
    And she should understand she is contributing to neighborhood flourishing
    And care visibility should extend across governance layers
    And identity as community member should be forming

  Scenario: Learning about different families' economic circumstances
    Given Emma's family has $40k/year income
    And neighborhood includes families with varied economic situations
    When Emma learns about community economic diversity
    Then teaching should be age-appropriate about economic difference
    And the personal_agent should explain without judgment
    And Emma should learn that families have different resources
    And she should develop empathy about economic constraint
    And class awareness should be taught with dignity for all
    And care economy should serve families across income spectrum

  Scenario: Neighborhood events integrate child into care economy
    Given the neighborhood holds community gatherings or shared resources
    And Emma participates in neighborhood activities
    When Emma attends community events
    Then her care contributions should carry across contexts
    And neighborhood_elohim should coordinate recognition
    And Emma should experience community as extension of family
    And she should learn care economy scales beyond household
    And community belonging should be built through participation
    And she should see herself as valued neighborhood member

  Scenario: Child understands privacy in community context
    Given Emma's data contributes to neighborhood patterns
    And she is learning about privacy concepts
    When Emma's anonymized data is aggregated
    Then she should understand her information is protected
    And her personal_agent should explain community data carefully
    And the agent should say "Your choices help the neighborhood, but your privacy is protected"
    And she should learn about balance between community good and privacy
    And data ethics education should be age-appropriate
    And she should understand collective benefit need not compromise privacy

  Scenario: Local environmental impact visible through neighborhood patterns
    Given Emma is learning ecological care concepts
    And neighborhood aggregate data shows environmental impact
    When Emma makes choices with environmental dimensions
    Then her personal_agent should share community environmental patterns
    And the agent should say "Your neighborhood has reduced plastic waste by choosing reusable bags"
    And she should see how individual choices aggregate to ecological impact
    And environmental stewardship should be connected to care economy
    And she should learn community can collectively care for local environment
    And ecological literacy should develop at appropriate scale

  Scenario: Child learns community economic power through collective action
    Given neighborhood families make coordinated choices
    And Emma participates in community economic patterns
    When Emma sees collective neighborhood impact
    Then she should learn about community economic agency
    And her personal_agent should explain collective power age-appropriately
    And the agent should say "When families choose together, stores listen"
    And she should understand communities can shape markets
    And care economy includes collective organizing dimension
    And she should learn early about community economic power
