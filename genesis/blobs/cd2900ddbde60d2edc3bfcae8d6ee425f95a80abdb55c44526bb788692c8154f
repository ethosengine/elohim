Scenario: Explaining cryptographic impossibility of backdoor mandates
    Given policy makers consider requiring backdoors for law enforcement
    And this would break constitutional verification
    When I testify to National Council about technical implications
    Then I explain: backdoors make cryptographic alignment proof impossible
    And I clarify: cannot have both backdoors and constitutional verification
    And I demonstrate: this is mathematical fact not implementation choice
    And I present: security vulnerabilities backdoors create
    And I acknowledge: this constrains what governance can mandate
    And I provide: evidence policy makers need for informed choice
    And I maintain: that I'm explaining constraints not dictating values
