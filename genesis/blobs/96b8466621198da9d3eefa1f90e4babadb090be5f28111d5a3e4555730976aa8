Scenario: Municipal community investment fund amplifies private capital
    Given community investment pools have limited capital for large conversions
    And municipal economic development funds could support democratic ownership
    When city creates municipal community investment fund
    Then Patricia's private investment is matched by public funds
    And combined capital enables larger conversions (grocery stores, manufacturers)
    And public-private partnership supports democratic economy at scale
    And taxpayer money supports community wealth-building, not corporate extraction
    And municipality_elohim manages public-private community investment coordination
