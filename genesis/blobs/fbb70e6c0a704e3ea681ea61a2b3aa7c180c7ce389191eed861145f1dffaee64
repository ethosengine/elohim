Scenario: Workplace privacy from family care data
    Given Sarah's parenting data should not be accessible to employer
    And strict privacy boundaries are essential
    When workplace and personal systems interact
    Then the workplace must have zero access to family care data
    And Sarah's personal_agent should protect her privacy absolutely
    And the workplace_elohim should respect complete privacy boundaries
    And the system should prevent workplace surveillance of personal life
    And professional and family spheres should remain separate
    And Sarah's care data should be her sovereign information
