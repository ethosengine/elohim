Scenario: Data-informed negotiation for equitable labor distribution
    Given household labor distribution is currently inequitable
    And Sarah wants fair partnership without resentment
    When Sarah and her partner negotiate labor distribution
    Then the household_elohim should provide specific data
    And it should show time spent, complexity of tasks, and mental load
    And it should enable "Let's talk about the 75/25 split" conversation
    And negotiation should be based on reality, not perception
    And the system should support movement toward equity
    And care economy principles should guide fair distribution
