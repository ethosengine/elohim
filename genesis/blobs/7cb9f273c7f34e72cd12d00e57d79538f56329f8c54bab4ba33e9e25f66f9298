Scenario: Teacher challenges state teacher evaluation mandate
    Given state law requires evaluation system based on student test scores
    And teachers know this creates perverse incentives and doesn't improve teaching
    When teachers organize statewide campaign through Observer
    Then teachers provide evidence on evaluation system failures
    And show how it drives teaching to test not student learning
    And present research on effective teacher evaluation approaches
    And build parent coalition around learning-centered not test-centered education
    And state evaluation policy becomes political accountability issue
