Given youth activists worldwide demand emergency climate action
And they want coordinated strikes across all continents
When the network establishes a coordinated action date
And local groups plan context-appropriate actions
And the coordination respects different hemispheres, cultures, and capacities
Then each community organizes autonomously within global framework
And the translation agents enable real-time cross-language coordination
And traditional media amplification is earned through demonstrated scale
And the collective action maintains coherence without centralized control
And impact is measured through network-wide participation tracking
And the strike demonstrates viable model for global coordination
