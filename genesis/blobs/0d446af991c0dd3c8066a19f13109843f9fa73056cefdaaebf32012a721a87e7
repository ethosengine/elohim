Scenario: Environmental commissioner evaluates watershed protection policy
    Given commission considers strengthening regulations on development near waterways
    And staff presents complex hydrology analysis and regulatory considerations
    And development interests argue restrictions are excessive
    When the commissioner requests Observer environmental policy analysis
    Then they receive comparison of proposed protections to peer jurisdictions' standards
    And see water quality trend data showing current protections insufficient
    And access analysis of development impacts on downstream water quality
    And get examples of how other communities balanced development and protection
    And independent analysis helps commissioner evaluate competing claims
