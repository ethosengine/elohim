Scenario: Maintaining family cultural practices across distance
    Given Aisha's family has specific cultural traditions
    And she wants to maintain cultural connection
    When Aisha participates in family cultural practices
    Then the family_elohim should support cultural continuity
    And it should help coordinate cultural events across distance
    And it should recognize cultural care work she performs
    And family cultural values should shape her care economy participation
    And distance shouldn't prevent cultural transmission
    And her cultural identity should be maintained through family care bonds
