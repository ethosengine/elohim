Scenario: Municipal tax policy connects to care economy investment
    Given Robert pays substantial property and income taxes
    And taxes should support care infrastructure
    And he has voice in how tax revenue is used
    When municipal_elohim connects taxation to care economy
    Then it should help him understand how his taxes fund care infrastructure
    And surface opportunities to advocate for care economy tax priorities
    And connect him to municipal revenue and taxation policy discussions
    And support advocacy for progressive taxation that funds care
    And build municipal tax policy that supports care economy
    And demonstrate that taxation is community investment in care
    And recognize that taxpayers should shape spending priorities
