Given protocol operates across state boundaries
And consistency is needed for coordination
When I work on interstate compact for protocol recognition
Then we establish: mutual recognition of council decisions across states
And we create: conflict resolution mechanisms for disputes
And we maintain: state sovereignty and variation
And we enable: coordination without centralization
And we show: federalism working for AI governance
And states cooperate: while preserving local autonomy
