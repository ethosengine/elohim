Scenario: Community investment enables renewable energy cooperatives
    Given fossil fuel dependence threatens climate stability
    And Patricia wants investment supporting renewable energy transition
    When community investment expands to renewable energy cooperatives
    Then her capital supports community solar and wind projects
    And democratic energy ownership replaces fossil fuel extraction
    And bioregional energy sovereignty increases through distributed renewables
    And climate mitigation is advanced through values-aligned investment
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates renewable energy cooperative investment
