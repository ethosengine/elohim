Scenario: Family decision-making includes student voice
    Given Kenji is becoming adult family member
    And family makes decisions that affect him
    When family discusses major decisions (moving, finances, elder care)
    Then the family_elohim should ensure Kenji's voice is included
    And it should recognize his emerging adult perspective as valuable
    And it should facilitate his participation despite distance
    And family governance should include student members as participants
    And the system should support transition from child to adult family voice
    And Kenji should participate in family decisions appropriately
