Scenario: Contributing care work to family despite being student
    Given Kenji provides emotional support to stressed parents
    And he helps younger siblings with homework and advice remotely
    When the family_elohim tracks Kenji's care contributions to family
    Then it should recognize emotional labor supporting family members
    And it should value advice and mentorship provided to siblings
    And it should accumulate care tokens for family support work
    And students should be recognized as care contributors, not just recipients
    And the system should make Kenji's family contributions visible
    And reciprocal care should be recognized even when receiving financial support
