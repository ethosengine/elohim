Scenario: Business adapts to worker priorities through democratic governance
    Given Rosa's priorities as owner shaped business direction
    And workers' priorities may differ in important ways
    When workers gain governance voice during transition
    Then schedule flexibility increases based on workers' family needs
    And service offerings adapt to worker expertise and interests
    And workplace improvements workers suggested previously get implemented
    And compensation equity is addressed through democratic value distribution
    And business becomes genuinely responsive to worker flourishing, not just profit
