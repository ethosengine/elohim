Scenario: Mandatory franchise purchasing is replaced by democratic supplier relationships
    Given franchise agreement required purchasing from corporate-approved vendors at markup
    And local suppliers offering better quality and prices were prohibited
    When purchasing autonomy is restored through franchise termination
    Then workers establish direct relationships with Johnson Farm and local distributors
    And supply costs decrease 30% through eliminating corporate markup
    And quality improves through local sourcing and worker choice
    And supplier relationships become partnerships, not corporate-mandated transactions
