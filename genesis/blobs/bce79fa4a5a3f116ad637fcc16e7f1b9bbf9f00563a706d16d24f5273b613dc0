Scenario: Workers share customer demand patterns for collective benefit
    Given Emma notices increasing demand for vegan options at ChickenMax
    And other food entities are also seeing this trend
    When REA systems document customer preference patterns
    Then industry_sector_elohim aggregates sector-wide demand data
    And workers across entities learn of vegan demand trend
    And sector coordinates with suppliers for plant-based ingredients
    And workers collaborate on vegan menu development
    And sector responds to customer needs faster than corporate competitors
