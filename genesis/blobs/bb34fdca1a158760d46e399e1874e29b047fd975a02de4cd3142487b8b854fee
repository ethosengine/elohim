Scenario: Reciprocal care flows across three generations
    Given Margaret receives some support from Sarah as she ages
    And Margaret provides childcare for Sarah's children
    And Margaret provides elder care for her own mother
    When the family_elohim analyzes multigenerational care patterns
    Then it should show care flowing in multiple directions
    And it should ensure care is not unidirectionally extractive
    And it should recognize reciprocity across time and generations
    And family relationships should be based on mutual support
    And care economy should be sustainable across generations
    And the system should enable healthy multigenerational care patterns
