Scenario: Food service workers across sector gain conversion knowledge and power
    Given workers at non-converted franchises observe democratic locations thriving
    And word spreads about $18/hour wages, ownership, and democratic voice
    When worker organizing across food service sector references democratic conversions
    Then workers demand democratic conversion or equivalent improvements at their locations
    And franchise operators face worker pressure to convert or match democratic conditions
    And worker power increases sector-wide through demonstration effect
    And sector-wide organizing becomes possible through democratic model inspiration
    And industry_sector_elohim supports cross-location worker organizing and education
