Scenario: Coordinating educational services across multiple children with different needs
    Given I have multiple children (ages 4 and 7) with different educational contexts
    And each child has unique needs, schools, and support requirements
    When I manage educational coordination for multiple children
    Then the Value Scanner tracks each child's educational needs separately
    And coordinates across different schools, teachers, and support services
    And helps me prioritize when children's needs conflict
    And ensures neither child's education suffers due to complexity
    And my personal_agent manages multiple educational calendars and requirements
    And recognizes multi-child educational coordination as substantial labor
    And validates that managing multiple children's education is complex
    And prevents educational tasks from overwhelming me
