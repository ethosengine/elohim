Scenario: Politician evaluates living wage proposal with comprehensive impact analysis
    Given business lobby claims living wage ordinance will destroy jobs
    And worker advocates demand wage increase
    When the Observer provides evidence-based wage policy analysis
    Then they see living wage outcomes in comparable jurisdictions
    And understand actual employment impacts versus predicted job losses
    And identify public cost savings from reduced need for assistance programs
    And review worker quality of life improvements from wage increases
    And make informed decision beyond ideological claims
