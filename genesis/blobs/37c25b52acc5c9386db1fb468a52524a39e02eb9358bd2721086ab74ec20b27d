Scenario: Teen contributes to neighborhood ecological stewardship
    Given Jasmine's neighborhood has collective garden spaces
    And environmental stewardship is part of neighborhood care economy
    When Jasmine contributes to neighborhood composting or garden maintenance
    Then her ecological care work should be tracked and valued
    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize environmental labor
    And she should learn that care extends to land and ecological systems
    And neighborhood food production should be understood as collective care work
    And her generation should develop expectation that communities steward their environment
    And ecological care should be integrated with social and economic care
