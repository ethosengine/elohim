Scenario: Shopping locally to support neighborhood economy
    Given I need to buy groceries and household items
    And local businesses are part of neighborhood care economy
    When I shop for necessities
    Then the protocol should identify accessible local businesses
    And recognize that shopping locally is care economy participation
    And show me how my purchases support neighborhood resilience
    And accumulate care tokens for supporting local commerce
