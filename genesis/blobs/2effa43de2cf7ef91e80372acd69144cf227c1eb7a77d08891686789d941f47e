Scenario: Board member monitors discipline disparities and pushes for equity
    Given the politician committed to equitable school climate
    When the Observer tracks discipline outcomes by demographics
    Then they see Black students suspended at 3x rate of white students
    And learn similar behaviors result in different consequences by race
    And identify which schools have restorative practices versus zero-tolerance
    And compare district patterns to best-practice districts
    And champion policy reform for equitable discipline
