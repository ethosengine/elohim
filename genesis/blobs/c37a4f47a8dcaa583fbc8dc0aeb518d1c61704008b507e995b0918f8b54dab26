Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Student
  As a student living with roommates and learning household coordination
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want fair distribution of household labor and recognition of care contributions
  So that our shared living is sustainable and equitable for all

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the student user "Kenji" is registered in the system
    And Kenji lives in shared apartment with three roommates
    And Kenji is the primary cook for the household
    And the household has four people total
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim could coordinate shared living
    And roommates have different schedules, budgets, and capabilities

  Scenario: Making invisible household care labor visible to roommates
    Given Kenji cooks meals for all four roommates regularly
    And he plans menus, shops for ingredients, and manages kitchen
    When the household_elohim tracks Kenji's household contributions
    Then it should quantify his cooking labor in care tokens
    And it should make visible that he provides nutrition care for four people
    And his roommates should see "Kenji cooked 18 meals this week for household"
    And invisible care work should become undeniably visible
    And the system should prevent resentment from invisible labor
    And fair household coordination requires visibility

  Scenario: Coordinating bulk buying to maximize household budget efficiency
    Given Kenji and roommates each have limited grocery budgets
    And bulk buying saves money but requires coordination
    When Kenji proposes coordinated bulk purchase of rice, beans, and cooking oil
    Then the household_elohim should facilitate group buying coordination
    And it should track who pays what and how costs are divided
    And it should calculate savings: "Bulk rice saves each person $8/month"
    And it should help roommates see financial benefit of coordination
    And the system should reduce friction in shared purchasing
    And collective buying should be easy and fair

  Scenario: Fair distribution of household labor among roommates
    Given Kenji does most cooking but little cleaning
    And roommates have different strengths and available time
    When the household_elohim tracks all household labor
    Then it should measure cooking, cleaning, shopping, maintenance, and organizing
    And it should show each roommate's contribution: "Kenji: 18hrs, Maya: 6hrs, Sam: 8hrs, Jordan: 4hrs"
    And it should surface imbalances explicitly
    And it should facilitate conversation about fair redistribution
    And the system should prevent exploitation through visibility
    And household equity should be measurable and adjustable

  Scenario: Roommate coordination for shared meals vs individual cooking
    Given some meals are shared and some are individual
    And coordination requires planning around different schedules
    When the household_elohim manages meal coordination
    Then it should track who's eating shared meals vs cooking separately
    And it should help schedule shared dinners when roommates are available
    And it should recognize Kenji's labor preparing shared meals
    And it should calculate fair cost sharing for shared food
    And the system should make coordination easy rather than burdensome
    And shared meals should build household community

  Scenario: Preventing roommate conflict through proactive visibility
    Given household labor imbalances breed resentment
    And students often avoid difficult conversations
    When the household_elohim detects emerging conflict patterns
    Then it should surface issues before they become conflicts
    And it should show data: "Jordan hasn't contributed household labor in 3 weeks"
    And it should facilitate constructive conversation with neutral framing
    And it should help roommates renegotiate responsibilities
    And preventive intervention should maintain household harmony
    And the system should support healthy household dynamics

  Scenario: Recognizing different resource contributions to household
    Given Kenji contributes time and labor but limited money
    And one roommate might contribute more financially but less labor
    When the household_elohim tracks all forms of contribution
    Then it should value both care labor and financial contributions
    And it should recognize Kenji's cooking as economic contribution
    And it should show equivalence: "Kenji's cooking worth $X in meal prep time saved"
    And it should prevent assumption that money is only real contribution
    And the system should value diverse contribution types
    And household equity should include labor, time, and money

  Scenario: Teaching household management as life skill
    Given Kenji is learning to coordinate shared living
    And household management is essential adult capability
    When the personal_agent supports Kenji's household skill development
    Then it should teach him to negotiate responsibilities fairly
    And it should help him communicate needs and boundaries
    And it should build his capability in conflict resolution
    And it should recognize household coordination as professional-grade skill
    And the agent should frame this as valuable life learning
    And Kenji should develop skills that serve all future shared living

  Scenario: Shared household inventory and waste reduction
    Given four roommates buy food independently
    And lack of coordination leads to duplicate purchases and waste
    When the household_elohim manages shared inventory
    Then it should track what's in shared pantry and refrigerator
    And it should prevent duplicate buying: "You already have pasta, Maya bought it Tuesday"
    And it should identify food about to expire
    And it should suggest meals using existing ingredients
    And the system should reduce household food waste
    And coordination should save money and resources for all roommates

  Scenario: Household emergency support and mutual aid
    Given one roommate might face financial crisis or sudden need
    And students often live very close to financial edge
    When a household member experiences emergency
    Then the household_elohim should facilitate mutual aid
    And it should help coordinate support: "Can roommates each contribute $20 to help Jordan?"
    And it should track emergency help as care tokens
    And it should build culture of reciprocal support
    And the system should recognize households as safety nets
    And roommate mutual aid should be valued and visible

  Scenario: Transition and turnover management in student households
    Given student housing is temporary and roommates change
    And Kenji might have different roommates each year
    When roommates transition in and out of household
    Then the household_elohim should document established patterns
    And it should help new roommates integrate into household norms
    And it should preserve institutional knowledge across transitions
    And it should help negotiate new arrangements with new people
    And the system should reduce friction from household turnover
    And care economy patterns should transfer across roommate changes

  Scenario: Privacy boundaries in shared living space
    Given Kenji shares space but deserves privacy
    And household coordination requires some information sharing
    When the household_elohim manages household data
    Then it should share only household-relevant information with roommates
    And Kenji's personal data should remain private
    And roommates should see his cooking contributions, not his financial struggles
    And privacy boundaries should be clear and respected
    And the system should balance coordination needs with personal privacy
    And Kenji should control what household information is shared

  Scenario: Building household community through shared care
    Given Kenji and roommates are temporarily living together
    And they could just be strangers sharing space
    When the household_elohim fosters care economy culture
    Then it should help them build genuine community
    And it should recognize shared meals as community building
    And it should value emotional support among roommates
    And it should show how care contributions create belonging
    And the system should help transform roommates into household family
    And student households should be recognized as temporary but real communities
