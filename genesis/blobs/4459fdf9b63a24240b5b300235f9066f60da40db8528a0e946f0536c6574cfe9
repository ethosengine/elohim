Scenario: Municipal data about teen contributions informs youth policy
    Given thousands of teens participate in care economy across the municipality
    And their contributions generate aggregate data about youth participation
    When municipal_elohim analyzes youth care economy patterns
    Then it should surface insights about teen contributions to city wellbeing
    And show that youth provide substantial unpaid household labor
    And demonstrate economic value of youth volunteering and community engagement
    And inform municipal policy about youth employment and education
    And shift public understanding from "youth as problems" to "youth as contributors"
    And support evidence-based youth policy grounded in actual participation data
