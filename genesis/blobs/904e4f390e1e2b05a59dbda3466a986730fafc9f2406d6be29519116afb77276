Scenario: Presenting employment capabilities despite resume gaps and crisis circumstances
    Given I have gaps in my employment history due to domestic violence and crisis
    And potential employers may discriminate based on gaps or circumstances
    When I apply for employment opportunities
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me present my capabilities effectively
    And provides strategies for explaining employment gaps honestly but strategically
    And helps me articulate transferable skills and competencies
    And recognizes my crisis navigation as demonstrating valuable skills
    And validates that gaps don't erase my professional capability
    And my personal_agent helps me craft application materials
    And tracks my employment search efforts and outcomes
    And celebrates my courage in seeking employment during recovery
