Scenario: Reducing food waste with fixed income constraints
    Given Margaret's budget requires maximizing every dollar
    And food waste represents meaningful lost resources
    When Margaret plans meals and shopping
    Then her personal_agent should help minimize waste
    And it should suggest appropriate portion sizes for one or two people
    And it should track perishables and suggest usage timing
    And it should recommend preservation techniques Margaret knows from experience
    And waste reduction should align with both budget and values
    And Margaret's generation's knowledge of frugality should be honored
