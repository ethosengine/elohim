Scenario: Neighborhood care tokens reflect accumulated contributions
    Given Frank contributes through council service, repairs, and relationship-building
    And he's invested decades in neighborhood relationships
    When the neighborhood_elohim calculates care tokens
    Then tokens should accumulate from all Frank's neighborhood contributions
    And governance participation, skilled labor, and social cohesion work should be valued
    And accumulated tokens should represent neighborhood standing and resources
    And Frank's contributions should create claims on neighborhood support
    And the care economy should recognize long-term neighborhood investment
    And his participation should be visible and celebrated
