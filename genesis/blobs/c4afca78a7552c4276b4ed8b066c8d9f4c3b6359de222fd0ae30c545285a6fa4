Scenario: Learning relationship and sexuality education with dignity
    Given Jordan is an adult with the same needs and desires as any adult
    And comprehensive sexuality education is a right
    When Jordan participates in relationships and sexuality education
    Then instruction is accessible, honest, and dignity-preserving
    And topics include healthy relationships, consent, and body autonomy
    And Jordan's questions are answered respectfully
    And Jordan learns to navigate relationships safely and joyfully
    And Jordan's adult sexuality is honored, not ignored or shamed
    And education supports Jordan's full adult human experience
