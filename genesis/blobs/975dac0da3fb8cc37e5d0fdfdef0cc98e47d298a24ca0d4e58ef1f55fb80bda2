Scenario: Protection from retaliation after filing appeal
    Given I filed an appeal that challenged an agent's authority
    And I was concerned about potential retaliation in future decisions
    When I continue interacting with Elohim agents after my appeal
    Then the appeal cannot be used against me in future decisions
    And Agents do not punish me for exercising my right to appeal
    And The system monitors for retaliatory patterns
    And I have recourse if I detect bias based on my appeal history
    And My right to dissent is protected as fundamental to the protocol
