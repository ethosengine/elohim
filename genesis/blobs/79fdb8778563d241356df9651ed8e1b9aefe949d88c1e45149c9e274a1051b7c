Scenario: Contributing to community care economy even while in crisis
    Given I am receiving support and have limited capacity
    And I still have skills, knowledge, and care to offer
    When opportunities arise to contribute to community
    Then the Value Scanner surfaces contribution opportunities matching my capacity
    And recognizes even small contributions as valuable
    And facilitates contributions that don't overwhelm my limited resources
    And tracks my care economy participation comprehensively
    And validates that I am contributor as well as recipient
    And my personal_agent suggests contributions I can manage
    And ensures my contributions are recognized with care tokens
    And supports reciprocity without exploiting vulnerable people
