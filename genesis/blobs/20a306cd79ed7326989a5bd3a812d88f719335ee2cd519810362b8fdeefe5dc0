Scenario: Solo parenting decisions without partner consultation or validation
    Given Maria makes every parenting decision alone
    And she has no co-parent to discuss, debate, or validate choices
    When Maria faces difficult parenting decisions
    Then the family_elohim should provide decision support and perspective
    And it should help her think through consequences and options
    And it should partially fill the gap of missing partner consultation
    And it should validate her decision-making authority
    And Maria should have AI thinking partner for parenting choices
