Scenario: Calibrating protocol to community-specific values
    Given Riverside has distinct cultural values and history
    And we want protocol to reflect our community identity
    When we engage in community calibration process
    Then we deliberate: about privacy thresholds (we value privacy highly)
    And we discuss: resource sharing norms (indigenous heritage influences us)
    And we consider: how our history affects trust (government betrayal in past)
    And we vote: on calibrations within constitutional bounds
    And we implement: community-specific settings
    And protocol respects: local sovereignty and cultural specificity
    And we exercise: meaningful self-governance within shared principles
