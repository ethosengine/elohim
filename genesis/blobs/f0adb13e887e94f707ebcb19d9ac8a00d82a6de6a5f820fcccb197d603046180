## Colossians 3:1-3

> "Note what we set our sites on things above, but this is not just a mindset, but the embodiment of this in the world". Colossians 3:1-3, 12-13 ESV
\[1\] If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. \[2\] Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. \[3\] For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
\[12\] Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, \[13\] bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.
