Scenario: Coordinating financial support for family
    Given my income is limited but family may need support
    When family members need financial help
    Then the protocol should help me assess what I can contribute
    And coordinate financial support across family network
    And recognize that my economic constraints are real
    And facilitate fair distribution of financial responsibility
