    Given DeShawn has accumulated 3 years of documented expertise at ChickenMax
    And he wants to move to Garden Bowl Express for career growth
    When DeShawn applies for position at Garden Bowl
    Then his ChickenMax REA profile is recognized across network
    And his skill tokens are valid at Garden Bowl
    And his seniority partially transfers based on sector contribution
    And Garden Bowl workers welcome him as proven contributor
    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates fair transition for both entities
