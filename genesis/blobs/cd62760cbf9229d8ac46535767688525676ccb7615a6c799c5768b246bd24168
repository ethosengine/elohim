Scenario: Emergency response coordinated through neighborhood networks
    Given emergencies may occur when Helen is alone
    And rapid response requires nearby support
    When emergency alert is triggered
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should contact nearby neighbors immediately
    And neighbors should be briefed on Helen's health conditions
    And her advance directives should guide neighbor response
    And network should be activated before or alongside 911
    And Helen should feel safe knowing neighbors will respond
    And the protocol should leverage proximity for emergency care
    And neighborhood networks should provide safety infrastructure
