Scenario: Peer reviewing global expert testimony across cultures
    Given experts from diverse technical traditions advise convention
    And peer review must work across different epistemologies
    When I review testimony from non-Western technical expert
    Then I respect: different approaches to technical knowledge
    And I identify: complementary insights from diverse perspectives
    And I avoid: dismissing unfamiliar technical traditions
    And I learn: from different ways of understanding AI systems
    And I strengthen: testimony through cross-cultural dialogue
    And I demonstrate: epistemic humility and global collaboration
