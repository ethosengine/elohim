Scenario: Garden and plant knowledge shared with community
    Given Helen has decades of gardening experience
    And she knows local plants, soil conditions, and growing patterns
    When Helen shares gardening and plant knowledge
    Then her expertise should be recognized as ecological contribution
    And community gardens should benefit from elder expertise
    And traditional plant knowledge should be preserved
    And care tokens should reflect her environmental teaching
    And the protocol should connect elder plant experts with community gardens
    And bioregional food sovereignty should be supported by elder knowledge
    And Helen's experience should enable local food production
