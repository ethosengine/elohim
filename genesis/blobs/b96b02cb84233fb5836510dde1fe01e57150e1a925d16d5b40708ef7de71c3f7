Scenario: Weather pattern knowledge from lifetime of observation
    Given Helen has observed local weather patterns for 82 years
    And her memory includes pre-climate change baselines
    When Helen describes historical weather patterns
    Then her observations should inform climate adaptation planning
    And community should learn from her memory of normal patterns
    And changes should be understood through personal testimony
    And bioregional climate knowledge should include elder perspectives
    And the protocol should capture knowledge before it's lost
    And Helen's observations should contribute to local climate understanding
    And environmental memory should be preserved through elder participation
