Scenario: Supporting protocol adoption in Global South nations
    Given developing nations need technology transfer and support
    And protocol shouldn't be Global North privilege
    When I advocate for international development support
    Then I promote: funding for Global South protocol infrastructure
    And I support: technology transfer and capacity building
    And I resist: digital colonialism disguised as development
    And I ensure: Global South communities control their adoption
    And I fund: mutual aid between wealthy and poor communities
    And I work: toward global equity in democratic AI governance
    And I recognize: that justice requires reducing inequality
