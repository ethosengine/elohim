    Given city council will vote on annual budget in three weeks
    And proposed cuts affect services in low-income neighborhoods

    Then the organizer receives early alert with enough time to organize
    And sees which communities are most affected by cuts
    And gets analysis of budget trade-offs and alternatives
    And identifies decision points where testimony will have impact
    And three weeks allows for education, coalition building, and mobilization
