Scenario: Understanding ecological impact of food systems work
    Given food systems have significant ecological footprint
    And my work is embedded in these systems
    When I want to understand ecological implications
    Then the protocol should provide information about food systems ecology
    And help me see connections between my work and environmental impact
    And support me in making choices that reduce ecological harm
    And recognize that ecological care is part of my care economy participation
