Scenario: Connecting to community food security programs
    Given Aisha's budget is tight
    And community food programs could help
    When Aisha explores community food resources
    Then the community_elohim should surface available programs
    And it should explain how care economy participation enables access
    And it should connect her to community gardens, food banks, or cooperatives
    And the system should reduce stigma through care economy framing
    And community food security should be presented as mutual support
    And accessing help should be dignified when contributing care
