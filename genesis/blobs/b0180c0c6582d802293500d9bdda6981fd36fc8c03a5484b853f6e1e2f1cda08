Scenario: My national experience informs global AI governance norms
    Given my nation has years of protocol experience
    And other nations learn from our successes and failures
    When I share our experience in global forums
    Then I provide: honest assessment of what worked
    And I acknowledge: mistakes and challenges
    And I share: legislative approaches that helped
    And I describe: how we resisted capture
    And I explain: how communities maintained sovereignty
    And my testimony: informs global democratic governance development
    And national experience: contributes to global wisdom
