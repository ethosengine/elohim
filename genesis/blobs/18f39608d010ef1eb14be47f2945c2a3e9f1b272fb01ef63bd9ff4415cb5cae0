Scenario: Appeal about generational authority and respect
    Given Family Elohim intervened in way that undermined parental authority
    And I believe this damages family cohesion and cultural values
    When I appeal the intervention approach rather than the outcome
    Then the Constitutional Council evaluates how intervention affected family structure
    And They balance individual protection with respect for family authority
    And They consider if the agent could achieve same care goal differently
    And They examine if family repair mechanisms were offered
    And The appeal establishes protocols for intervention that preserve family dignity
    And Recognition that how care is delivered matters as much as that it's delivered
