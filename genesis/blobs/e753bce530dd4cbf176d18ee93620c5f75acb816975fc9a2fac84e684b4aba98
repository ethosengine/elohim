Scenario: Parent tracks curriculum policy transparency
    Given the school board discusses curriculum changes
    And the parent wants to understand what their child will learn
    When the parent reviews Observer's curriculum analysis
    Then they see specific content being added or removed
    And understand pedagogical approaches and their evidence base
    And view teacher professional perspectives on the curriculum
    And can evaluate changes based on child's learning needs
    And curriculum decisions include parent informed input
