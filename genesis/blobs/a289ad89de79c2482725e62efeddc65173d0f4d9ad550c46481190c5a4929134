Scenario: Intensive training prepares me for constitutional interpretation
    Given I have accepted my Constitutional Council appointment
    And I need to understand constitutional principles to judge agent decisions
    When I complete 3-week training program
    Then I learn: constitutional principles and their application
    And I study: how agents reason and make decisions
    And I practice: deliberation protocols and consensus building
    And I review: historical precedents and case studies
    And I am educated: without being indoctrinated about "correct" answers
    And I develop: judgment capacity not just knowledge
    And I feel: prepared to serve despite lack of formal expertise
