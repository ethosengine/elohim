Scenario: Developer faces accountability for regional pattern of extraction
    Given a developer concentrates luxury developments in affluent areas
    And avoids affordable housing obligations through jurisdictional arbitrage
    When the Observer reveals regional development patterns
    Then planning bodies see: 12 luxury projects, zero affordable housing contribution
    And pattern shows developer plays municipalities against each other
    And uses weakest regulations to avoid affordable housing requirements
    And regional coordination can address jurisdictional arbitrage
    And systematic extraction becomes visible and challengeable
