Scenario: Journalist fact-checks governor's claims on economic record
    Given the governor campaigns on economic success claims
    And the journalist provides accountability coverage
    When the Observer analyzes state economic data
    Then the journalist verifies job growth claim (accurate but misleading framing)
    And finds wage growth lags behind neighboring states
    And shows poverty rate increased despite jobs claim
    And identifies tax cut benefits concentrated in top income bracket
    And publishes fact-check grounding rhetoric in evidence
