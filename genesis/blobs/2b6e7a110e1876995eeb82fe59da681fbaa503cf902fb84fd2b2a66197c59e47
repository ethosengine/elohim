Scenario: Building relationships with neighbors despite time constraints
    Given neighborhood resilience depends on connection between residents
    And my work schedule limits social time
    When I have brief moments available
    Then the protocol should help me build neighbor relationships
    And suggest low-time ways to connect and contribute
    And recognize that presence and greeting count as care
    And support neighborhood social fabric even with limited participation
