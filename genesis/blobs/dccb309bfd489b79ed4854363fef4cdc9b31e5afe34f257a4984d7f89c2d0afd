Scenario: Family care tokens reflect four-generation care flows
    Given care flows in multiple directions across the family
    And Robert receives support from siblings and provides support to parents and children
    And care contributions need to be recognized across all flows
    When family_elohim calculates family care tokens
    Then it should track care across all four generations
    And recognize Robert's care for parents and support for children
    And value siblings' parent care contributions
    And recognize adult children's emerging care contributions
    And track grandparent care across the family
    And make visible the complex web of family care reciprocity
    And demonstrate that family functions through mutual care
