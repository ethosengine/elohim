Scenario: Democratic value distribution replaces hierarchical extraction
    Given ChickenMax generates $100K monthly revenue
    And elimination of franchise fees freed $48K annually
    When workers hold their quarterly value distribution governance meeting
    Then transparent REA accounting shows complete revenue and cost breakdown
    And workers democratically decide wage allocation ($60K to wages)
    And workers vote on community program funding ($10K to senior meals)
    And workers approve environmental sustainability investment ($8K to regenerative sourcing)
    And every worker sees exactly how value flows and why
    And workers can modify distribution algorithms democratically
