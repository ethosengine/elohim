Scenario: Politician evaluates curriculum controversy with evidence beyond ideology
    Given vocal activists demand curriculum changes on ideological grounds
    And both sides present culture war framing
    When the Observer provides evidence-based curriculum analysis
    Then they see what's actually taught in classrooms versus political claims
    And review curriculum outcomes in student learning and engagement
    And identify teacher and parent perspectives beyond activist voices
    And compare curriculum to best practices in high-performing districts
    And make decision based on educational merit not political pressure
