Feature: Education Policy Governance for Elected Representative
  As a politician in the public_observer system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to make informed education policy decisions
  So that I can serve student wellbeing despite technical complexity and ideological pressure

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the politician user is registered in the system
    And the educational governance context is active

  Scenario: Politician understands education outcome patterns across demographics
    Given the politician governs education policy at state or district level
    And achievement gaps persist across racial and economic lines
    When the Observer analyzes outcome patterns systemically
    Then they see which student populations are underserved
    And identify specific schools with equitable outcomes despite demographics
    And learn what successful schools do differently
    And understand resource and practice patterns that drive equity
    And champion evidence-based policies for all students

  Scenario: Politician evaluates curriculum controversy with evidence beyond ideology
    Given vocal activists demand curriculum changes on ideological grounds
    And both sides present culture war framing
    When the Observer provides evidence-based curriculum analysis
    Then they see what's actually taught in classrooms versus political claims
    And review curriculum outcomes in student learning and engagement
    And identify teacher and parent perspectives beyond activist voices
    And compare curriculum to best practices in high-performing districts
    And make decision based on educational merit not political pressure

  Scenario: Politician tracks accountability for education reform implementation
    Given the politician championed reading improvement initiative
    And allocated funding for evidence-based interventions
    When the Observer monitors implementation and outcomes
    Then they see which schools implement reforms with fidelity
    And track reading proficiency changes after intervention
    And identify schools where implementation stalled or failed
    And understand barriers to effective implementation
    And intervene to ensure funding translates to student outcomes

  Scenario: Politician surfaces teacher and parent priorities at scale
    Given the politician hears from organized advocacy groups
    But suspects classroom realities differ from political narratives
    When the Observer aggregates teacher and parent input
    Then they see teachers prioritize classroom resources and planning time
    And learn parents want smaller class sizes and mental health support
    And identify disconnect between political fights and family priorities
    And understand professional educator perspectives on policy proposals
    And align education policy with teaching and learning needs

  Scenario: Politician evaluates charter school expansion with comprehensive analysis
    Given charter advocates push for expansion with achievement promises
    And traditional public school advocates warn of harmful impacts
    When the Observer analyzes charter performance and impacts
    Then they see charter outcomes controlling for selective enrollment
    And understand fiscal impacts on district school budgets
    And identify which students benefit from charters versus harmed
    And review discipline and expulsion patterns for vulnerable students
    And make informed decision balancing innovation with equity

  Scenario: Politician builds coalition for education funding increase
    Given the politician champions education investment
    And needs public support for tax increase
    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities
    Then they see parents across political spectrum support smaller class sizes
    And identify business community concern about workforce preparation
    And connect with educators who can explain funding impacts
    And facilitate coalition across traditional political divides
    And build broad-based campaign for education investment

  Scenario: Politician exposes education funding inequities across schools
    Given the politician suspects resource distribution creates outcome gaps
    When the Observer analyzes education funding patterns
    Then they see experienced teachers concentrated in affluent schools
    And identify per-student spending disparities within districts
    And understand how funding formulas create systematic inequities
    And calculate impact of equitable funding on underserved schools
    And champion funding reforms with evidence of current harms

  Scenario: Politician distinguishes education reform evidence from ideology
    Given competing reform proposals claim research support
    And ideological advocacy masks as evidence-based policy
    When the Observer evaluates education research rigorously
    Then they see which reforms have strong evidence base
    And identify advocacy research versus peer-reviewed findings
    And understand limitations and contexts of research claims
    And compare reform outcomes across diverse implementation sites
    And make evidence-based policy decisions beyond ideological fights

  Scenario: Politician monitors special education compliance and outcomes
    Given the politician has legal obligation to serve students with disabilities
    And families report barriers to appropriate services
    When the Observer tracks special education implementation
    Then they see evaluation and IEP compliance rates by school
    And identify which students wait longest for evaluations
    And understand resource allocation for special education services
    And learn where families face pushback on service requests
    And ensure legal obligations and student needs are met

  Scenario: Politician navigates high-stakes testing debate with outcome focus
    Given testing requirements create political controversy
    And both supporters and critics make competing claims
    When the Observer analyzes testing data and educational impacts
    Then they see how much instructional time testing consumes
    And understand what testing reveals versus distorts about learning
    And identify schools where testing drives harmful practices
    And review alternative assessment models in other states
    And balance accountability needs with teaching and learning quality
