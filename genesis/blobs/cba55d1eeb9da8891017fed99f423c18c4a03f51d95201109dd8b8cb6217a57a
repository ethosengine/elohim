Scenario: Refugee maintains family connection across borders
    Given Amira's parents and siblings remain in Syria
    And internet access in Syria is unreliable and monitored
    When Amira communicates with her family through Elohim
    And the translation agent provides Arabic-German translation
    Then communication flows securely across borders
    And her family's privacy is protected from Syrian surveillance
    And Amira maintains vital family bonds despite separation
    And the distributed architecture bypasses censorship
    And family photos and memories are safely shared
