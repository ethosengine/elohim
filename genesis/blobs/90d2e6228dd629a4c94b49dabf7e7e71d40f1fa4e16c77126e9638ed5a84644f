Scenario: Organizer develops community leader for public testimony
    Given a tenant has never spoken at public meetings
    And they want to testify about rent burden at city council
    When the organizer uses Observer to support leadership development
    Then the tenant receives accessible data on local rent patterns
    And gets sample testimony framework personalized to their experience
    And sees common questions and effective response strategies
    And practices using Observer's preparation tools
    And emerges as powerful community voice not dependent on organizer
