Scenario: Neighborhood watch and safety network for single-parent families
    Given Maria worries about household and child safety as solo parent
    And she cannot be everywhere at once
    When neighborhood safety networks operate
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate neighborhood watch efforts
    And neighbors should look out for each other's children and properties
    And Maria should feel enhanced security through community vigilance
    And single-parent households should benefit from neighborhood collective care
    And safety should be community responsibility, not solo parent burden
