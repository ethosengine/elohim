Scenario: Citizen participates in curriculum policy discussion
    Given the school board is considering curriculum changes
    And the citizen has children or cares about education
    When the Observer provides background and context
    Then the citizen learns what successful curriculum looks like
    And sees teacher professional perspectives on the proposal
    And understands student and parent concerns
    And can contribute informed perspective to discussion
    And participatory democracy extends to educational content
