Scenario: Family care tokens reflect Frank's contributions across family
    Given care flows in multiple directions across the family
    And Frank provides grandchild care, elder support, and adult child guidance
    When family_elohim calculates family care tokens
    Then it should track care across all three generations
    And recognize Frank's care for grandchildren and mother-in-law
    And value his support for adult children
    And accumulate tokens representing Frank's family contributions
    And these tokens should create claims on future family support
    And the complex web of family care reciprocity should be visible
    And Frank should see his place in lifecycle care flows
