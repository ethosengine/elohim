Scenario: Municipal youth advisory board includes teen care economy participants
    Given the municipality is establishing youth civic engagement structures
    And Jasmine has demonstrated leadership through care contributions
    When the municipal_elohim identifies candidates for youth advisory board
    Then Jasmine should be surfaced as a potential participant
    And her care economy track record should demonstrate her capability
    And selection should be based on demonstrated contribution, not just academic achievement
    And diverse youth voices should be included in municipal governance
    And teens should participate in decisions that affect their lives
    And youth advisory structures should have real power, not just token representation
