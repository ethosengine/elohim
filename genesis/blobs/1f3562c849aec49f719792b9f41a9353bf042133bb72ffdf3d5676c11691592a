Scenario: Waste reduction as household care contribution
    Given Sarah manages household waste and recycling
    And reducing waste requires planning and effort
    When the ecological_elohim tracks waste reduction work
    Then it should recognize waste management as care labor
    And it should value Sarah's composting, recycling, waste minimization
    And it should quantify environmental benefit of her work
    And waste reduction should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should make invisible ecological labor visible
    And Sarah's environmental care work should be recognized
