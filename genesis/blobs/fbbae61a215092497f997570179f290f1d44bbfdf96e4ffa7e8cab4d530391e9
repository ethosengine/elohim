Scenario: Alex's life choices respected by family without ableist judgment
    Given Alex makes life choices that family might not understand
    And ableism might lead family to question Alex's decisions
    When Alex makes choices about work, living situation, relationships, etc.
    Then family should respect Alex's choices as they would any adult's
    And the family_elohim should affirm Alex's right to self-determination
    And disability should not be treated as reason to override Alex's autonomy
    And Alex should not have to justify choices more than non-disabled siblings
    And the protocol should protect Alex from family paternalism
    And Alex's sovereignty should be structurally defended
    And family should be prompted to examine their ableist assumptions
