Scenario: Politician builds coalition for green infrastructure investment
    Given the politician champions urban tree canopy expansion
    And needs support across diverse constituencies
    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities
    Then they see environmental groups support ecological benefits
    And identify public health advocates concerned about heat and air quality
    And connect with neighborhood groups seeking park improvements
    And facilitate coalition across environmental and equity interests
    And build broad-based support for green infrastructure
