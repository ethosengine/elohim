Scenario: Advising on global technical standards with cultural sensitivity
    Given global protocol needs technical standards
    And different cultures have different technical capacities
    When I help develop culturally-sensitive technical requirements
    Then I ensure: standards work with varying infrastructure
    And I avoid: assuming Global North technical context
    And I support: diverse implementation approaches
    And I enable: low-resource communities to participate
    And I collaborate: with Global South technical experts
    And I resist: digital colonialism in technical design
    And I demonstrate: that technical standards can honor diversity
