Scenario: National precedent creates appellant bill of rights
    Given my case and similar appeals reveal patterns of dignity violations
    And National Constitutional Council recognizes systemic gaps
    When they craft comprehensive precedent from accumulated appeals
    Then they establish detailed appellant rights framework
    And They enumerate: right to explanation, right to be heard, right to escalation
    And They specify: timelines, accessibility requirements, protection from retaliation
    And They create: precedent search tools, representation rights, dignity guarantees
    And The framework becomes national standard for all appeal processes
    And My appeal contributes to constitutional articulation of procedural justice
    And Future appellants benefit from clearer rights and stronger protections
