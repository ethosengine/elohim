# The Value of Self-Knowledge

## γνῶθι σεαυτόν (Know Thyself)

This ancient Greek maxim, inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, has guided seekers of wisdom for millennia. In the Elohim Protocol, self-knowledge serves three purposes:

### 1. Foundation for Growth

You cannot grow toward a destination you haven't identified. Self-knowledge reveals:
- Your current position (where you are)
- Your authentic values (what truly matters)
- Your patterns (how you typically respond)

### 2. Prerequisite for Loving Others

"Love your neighbor as yourself" implies three loves:
- Love of the divine
- Love of neighbor
- Love of self

Without knowing yourself, how can you extend to others what you don't possess?

### 3. Protection Against Manipulation

Systems that know you better than you know yourself can manipulate. Self-knowledge is sovereignty.
