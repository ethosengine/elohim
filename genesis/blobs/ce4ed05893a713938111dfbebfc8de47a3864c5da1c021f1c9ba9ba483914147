Scenario: Sibling coordination for mother's care to prevent overwhelming James
    Given James's siblings also have responsibility for their mother
    And James is already overwhelmed with David's care
    When the family_elohim tracks sibling care contributions
    Then it should ensure siblings share mother's care equitably
    And it should prevent care from defaulting entirely to James
    And it should coordinate among siblings for fair distribution
    And James's dual burden should not excuse siblings from contributing
    And family care should be distributed based on capacity
