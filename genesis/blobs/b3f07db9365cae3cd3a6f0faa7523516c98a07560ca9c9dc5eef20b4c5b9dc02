Scenario: Bioregional food system reduces fossil fuel dependence dramatically
    Given industrial food system depends on fossil fuels (synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, transportation)
    And energy transition requires reducing agricultural fossil fuel use
    When democratic bioregional food system prioritizes energy sustainability
    Then local distribution eliminates long-haul transportation energy use
    And organic practices reduce synthetic fertilizer dependence
    And renewable energy powers farm operations and distribution
    And food system fossil fuel use decreases 80%+ through bioregional coordination
