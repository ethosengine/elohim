Feature: Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Teen
  As a teen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer
  I want my paid work recognized as care labor with fair compensation and healthy conditions
  So that I learn to recognize my rights as a worker and expect all work to operate on care economy principles

  Background:

    And the teen user "Jasmine" is registered in the system
    And Jasmine is 16 years old
    And she works part-time (15 hours/week) at a retail store
    And the workplace governance context is active
    And workplace_elohim monitors work conditions and labor recognition
    And Jasmine's personal_agent serves as workplace advocate

  Scenario: Teen's paid work recognized as care labor
    Given Jasmine works in retail serving customers
    And traditional economics treats this as market transaction only
    When workplace_elohim processes her work
    Then it should recognize that her labor is care work
    And helping customers find what they need is care
    And supporting co-workers is care
    And contributing to community through her work is care
    And she should learn to see all work through care economy lens
    And understand that service work is valuable care labor
    And expect her work to be valued as contribution to collective flourishing

  Scenario: Workplace conditions monitored to prevent teen labor exploitation
    Given Jasmine is vulnerable as a young worker
    And young workers often face exploitation

    Then it should monitor whether she's fairly compensated for her labor
    And flag if hours exceed healthy limits
    And recognize if she's asked to work in unsafe conditions
    And track if she's getting required breaks
    And identify if she's experiencing harassment or discrimination
    And surface resources about her rights as a worker
    And provide support if workplace becomes exploitative

  Scenario: Teen learns to recognize fair compensation
    Given Jasmine earns $15/hour at her retail job
    And the local living wage is $18/hour
    When her personal_agent analyzes her compensation
    Then it should help her understand whether pay is fair
    And show how her wages compare to living wage standards
    And help her calculate the real value of her labor
    And teach her to recognize when work is undercompensated
    And build her expectation that labor deserves fair compensation
    And prepare her to advocate for fair wages as an adult worker

  Scenario: Teen's work schedule coordinated with other life contexts
    Given Jasmine balances work, school, family responsibilities, and social life
    And her work schedule changes weekly
    When workplace_elohim communicates her schedule
    Then it should coordinate with her personal_agent
    And flag conflicts with school, family needs, or personal commitments
    And help her negotiate schedule that allows balanced life
    And prevent work from overwhelming other essential contexts
    And support her learning to set healthy work boundaries
    And demonstrate that work is one part of life, not life itself

  Scenario: Workplace skills integrated with broader capability development
    Given Jasmine learns customer service, inventory management, and problem-solving at work
    And these skills transfer to other contexts

    And connect to educational and career planning
    And help her see work as capability building, not just income
    And integrate workplace learning with her overall development
    And value skills development as part of work's worth

  Scenario: Teen understands worker rights and labor protections
    Given Jasmine is entitled to labor protections as a worker
    And many young workers don't know their rights

    Then it should teach her about minimum wage, overtime, breaks, and safety regulations
    And explain youth-specific labor protections
    And inform her about right to organize and collective bargaining
    And provide resources about reporting labor violations
    And help her understand that worker rights exist to prevent exploitation
    And build her expectation that labor deserves legal protection

  Scenario: Workplace relationships build professional networks
    Given Jasmine works with manager Sarah and co-workers across age ranges
    And workplace relationships can support her future career

    And teach her to navigate workplace relationships appropriately
    And build her professional social capital

    And track the full value she creates, not just what she's paid
    And help her understand the difference between value created and compensation received
    And build her critical awareness of labor economics
    And prepare her to advocate for fair value recognition

  Scenario: Workplace serves teen's development, not just employer's profit
    Given Jasmine's work should contribute to her flourishing
    And employment should support her transition to adulthood

    And recognize if employer is investing in her skill development
    And identify if work experience is building her career capability
    And advocate that employment should serve mutual benefit
    And help her understand that healthy employment supports worker flourishing

  Scenario: Teen co-workers coordinate through care economy networks

    And recognize that unpaid care work is as valuable as paid work
    And build sophisticated understanding that economy is broader than paid employment
    And internalize care economy framework as normal economic thinking

  Scenario: Workplace exploitation flagged and resources provided
    Given Jasmine's employer violates labor laws
    And she is asked to work off the clock
    When workplace_elohim detects the violation
    Then it should flag the exploitation to Jasmine
    And explain that this is illegal and not acceptable
    And provide resources about reporting labor violations
    And connect her to worker advocacy organizations
    And support her in addressing the problem
    And protect her from accepting exploitation as normal
    And demonstrate that care economy includes protecting workers from harm

  Scenario: Teen learns healthy work-life boundaries
    Given Jasmine's employer frequently requests last-minute schedule changes
    And this disrupts her school and family commitments

    And support her in negotiating better scheduling practices
    And teach her that workers can and should set boundaries
    And build her expectation that work should respect whole life
