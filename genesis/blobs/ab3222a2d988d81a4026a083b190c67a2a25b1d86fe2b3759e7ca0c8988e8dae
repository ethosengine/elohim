Scenario: Citizen identifies environmental justice patterns
    Given the citizen is concerned about neighborhood air quality
    When the Observer analyzes pollution and green space distribution
    Then the citizen sees industrial permits cluster in low-income areas
    And parks and trees concentrate in wealthy neighborhoods
    And environmental burden patterns become undeniable
    And can advocate for equitable environmental policy
    And environmental racism becomes visible and challengeable
