Scenario: Developer habitat destruction versus mitigation reality
    Given a developer destroys 40 acres of forest for development
    And promises habitat mitigation will offset ecological loss
    When the Observer tracks mitigation outcomes over five years
    Then analysis shows: mitigation site has 40% native species survival
    And ecological function is fraction of destroyed habitat
    And offset calculation was based on optimistic assumptions not reality
    And net ecological loss is substantial despite mitigation promises
    And honest accounting informs better environmental protection policy
