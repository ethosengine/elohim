Scenario: Equipment and facilities knowledge prevents operational failures
    Given Rosa knows every quirk of equipment and building systems
    And this tacit knowledge prevents costly breakdowns and delays
    When facilities knowledge transfer is prioritized
    Then Rosa documents equipment maintenance schedules and troubleshooting
    And workers learn which compressor sounds indicate problems
    And building system knowledge (electrical, plumbing, HVAC) is shared
    And maintenance protocols are established preventing future failures
    And institutional knowledge replaces individual expertise
