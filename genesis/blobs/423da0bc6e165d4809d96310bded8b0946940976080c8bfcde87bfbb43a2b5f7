Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person
  As a retired person in the value scanner system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want my volunteer labor and community leadership recognized as valuable contribution
  So that retired people are understood as community builders, not economic dependents

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the retired user "Frank" is registered in the system
    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction
    And Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim coordinates community care economy
    And Frank's construction skills serve community housing needs

  Scenario: Skilled volunteer labor valued at market rates for community contribution
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity
    And he provides skilled construction labor
    And this work has clear market value (~$40/hour for skilled trades)
    When the community_elohim tracks volunteer contributions
    Then Frank's volunteer labor should be quantified specifically
    And market value should be calculated (~$20k/year contribution)
    And his skilled labor should be recognized as substantial community asset
    And community care tokens should accumulate from volunteer work
    And Frank should see quantified value of his contribution
    And the narrative of retired as "not contributing" should be countered
    And community should recognize his volunteer work as real economic value

  Scenario: Habitat for Humanity work recognized as housing care economy contribution
    Given Frank's volunteer work builds housing for families in need
    And his construction expertise enables affordable housing
    When the community_elohim tracks housing care economy
    Then Frank's work should be recognized as addressing housing crisis
    And building homes should be valued as community care contribution
    And his labor should be connected to housing outcomes (families housed)
    And community should see that Frank's work creates housing that policy fails to provide
    And volunteer construction should be understood as care economy infrastructure
    And Frank should experience his work as meaningful community contribution

  Scenario: Coordinating volunteer participation with other life commitments
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week
    And he also provides family care and participates in neighborhood governance
    When the community_elohim coordinates his participation
    Then it should integrate volunteer work with other commitments
    And help Frank maintain sustainable participation level
    And prevent volunteer burnout through overcommitment
    And coordinate scheduling across community, family, and neighborhood
    And support Frank in balancing diverse care contributions
    And enable long-term sustainable volunteer engagement

  Scenario: Retired residents as experienced community leaders and organizers
    Given Frank has decades of community experience
    And he understands community dynamics and history
    When the community_elohim facilitates leadership
    Then Frank's accumulated experience should position him for leadership
    And his knowledge should inform community organizing and policy
    And community should actively seek his participation in decision-making
    And decades of community investment should confer legitimate authority
    And elder leadership should be welcomed and valued
    And Frank should experience himself as community leader, not marginal participant

  Scenario: Mentoring younger volunteers in construction and community work
    Given Frank has both construction expertise and volunteering experience
    And younger volunteers need skill development and guidance
    When the community_elohim coordinates mentoring
    Then it should connect Frank to volunteers seeking construction skills
    And facilitate teaching and skill transmission
    And recognize mentoring as multiplying Frank's contribution
    And value teaching labor as care contribution
    And build community capacity through intergenerational skill sharing
    And Frank should experience meaningful role as mentor and teacher

  Scenario: Community care tokens accumulate from sustained volunteer participation
    Given Frank has volunteered consistently over years
    And his contributions are substantial and ongoing
    When the community_elohim calculates care tokens
    Then tokens should accumulate from Frank's volunteer hours
    And skill level should affect token value (skilled trades valued highly)
    And sustained participation should be recognized over time
    And accumulated tokens should represent Frank's community standing
    And tokens should create claims on community resources and support
    And his years of contribution should be visible and valued

  Scenario: Connecting retired residents to volunteer opportunities matching their skills
    Given Frank has construction expertise
    And community has diverse volunteer needs
    When the community_elohim matches volunteers to opportunities
    Then it should identify opportunities utilizing Frank's specific skills
    And surface construction-related needs beyond Habitat
    And coordinate with organizations seeking skilled volunteers
    And help Frank find meaningful work aligned with expertise
    And maximize community benefit from his particular capabilities
    And enable Frank to contribute at highest skill level

  Scenario: Volunteer work accessibility for aging participants
    Given Frank is 70 and managing age-related physical changes
    And he wants to continue contributing through volunteer work
    When the community_elohim coordinates accessibility
    Then it should match Frank to work appropriate for his capabilities
    And surface modifications that enable continued participation
    And recognize when physical limitations require adaptation
    And help transition to less physically demanding roles if needed
    And protect Frank's safety while maximizing contribution
    And enable continued meaningful participation throughout aging

  Scenario: Community governance includes retired residents as active participants
    Given Frank and other retired residents have time for civic engagement
    And they have accumulated community knowledge and experience
    When the community_elohim facilitates governance
    Then it should actively include retired residents in decision-making
    And their time availability should enable substantial governance participation
    And their experience should inform community policy and planning
    And community decisions should benefit from elder wisdom
    And retired residents should be understood as governance resources, not dependents
    And Frank should participate in shaping community direction

  Scenario: Retired residents build care economy infrastructure through organizing
    Given Frank and other retired residents have time for organizing
    And care economy requires coordination and infrastructure
    When the community_elohim supports infrastructure building
    Then it should enable retired residents to organize care economy systems
    And coordinate tool libraries, skill shares, mutual aid networks
    And facilitate care coordination that benefits all community members
    And recognize organizing labor as valuable care contribution
    And retired residents should be understood as infrastructure builders
    And Frank should help establish care economy as normal community practice

  Scenario: Community education and skill-sharing led by retired residents
    Given Frank has decades of construction knowledge
    And community members need practical skills
    When the community_elohim coordinates education
    Then it should facilitate Frank teaching construction workshops
    And coordinate skill-sharing sessions utilizing retired residents' expertise
    And recognize teaching as valuable community care contribution
    And enable knowledge transmission from experienced to learning members
    And build community capacity through elder knowledge sharing
    And Frank should experience meaningful teaching role

  Scenario: Community resource allocation recognizes volunteer contributions
    Given Frank provides substantial volunteer labor
    And community resources are limited
    When the community_elohim influences resource allocation
    Then Frank's contributions should be visible in allocation decisions
    And his care tokens should provide access to community resources
    And volunteers should not face additional burden from low income
    And community resources should flow to contributors equitably
    And Frank's volunteer work should be recognized through material support
    And care economy should function as mutual aid, not charity

  Scenario: Visibility of aggregate retired resident contributions transforms perception
    Given Frank is one of many retired residents contributing substantial volunteer labor
    And aggregate impact is significant but invisible in traditional metrics
    When the community_elohim surfaces aggregate data
    Then it should quantify total volunteer labor from retired residents
    And calculate combined market value (potentially millions annually)
    And demonstrate that retired residents are massive community asset
    And counter narrative of elders as economic burden
    And transform community understanding of retirement contributions
    And support policy that recognizes and values retired resident participation
    And Frank should see himself as part of powerful community infrastructure
