Scenario: Understanding bioregional food systems
    Given Kenji's food comes from complex global supply chains
    And bioregional food systems are more sustainable
    When the bioregional_elohim educates about food sourcing
    Then it should show him where his food comes from
    And it should help him identify local and seasonal options within budget
    And it should teach him about bioregional food production
    And it should connect his shopping to support for local food systems
    And the system should build bioregional food literacy
    And Kenji should understand food through ecological and regional lens
