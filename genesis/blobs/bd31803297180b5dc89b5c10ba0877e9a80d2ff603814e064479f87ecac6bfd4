Scenario: Living wage that enables sole provider to support family
    Given Maria is the only income earner for household of four
    And $42k/year is barely sustainable for her family size
    When Maria's compensation is determined
    Then the workplace_elohim should provide data on single parent economic needs
    And wage should enable household flourishing, not just survival
    And employers should understand many workers are sole household providers
    And fair compensation should account for single-income household realities
    And Maria should earn enough to support her family with dignity
