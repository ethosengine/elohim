Scenario: Making aggregate senior contributions visible at community scale
    Given thousands of seniors make similar contributions
    And their collective labor is massive but invisible
    When the community_elohim aggregates senior care contributions
    Then the community should see total senior care economy value
    And data should show seniors as highly productive population
    And cultural narratives about retirement should be challenged
    And policy should reflect actual senior contributions
    And community should recognize dependence on senior labor
    And visibility could transform attitudes about aging and retirement
