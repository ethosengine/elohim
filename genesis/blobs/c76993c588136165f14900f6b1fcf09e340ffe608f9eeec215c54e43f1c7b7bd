Feature: Municipal Governance for Community Leader
  As a community_leader in the governance system
  Operating at the municipal governance layer
  I want to coordinate across Riverside neighborhoods for citywide flourishing
  So that diverse neighborhood needs are balanced within shared infrastructure

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Jamal Washington leads Riverside municipality
    And the municipal governance context is active
    And multiple neighborhoods have different needs and priorities

  Scenario: Coordinate resource allocation across diverse neighborhoods
    Given downtown needs economic development support
    And residential areas prioritize environmental protection
    And outskirts need infrastructure investment
    When Municipal Elohim analyzes resource allocation
    Then agent shows resource flows and gaps across neighborhoods
    And agent identifies conflicts and synergies
    And Jamal facilitates city council deliberation with agent data
    And city council makes democratic allocation decisions
    And protocol enables informed democratic choice

  Scenario: Address climate refugee resettlement at municipal scale
    Given climate refugees are arriving faster than housing can accommodate
    And Municipal Elohim coordinates capacity mapping
    When Jamal works with agent on integration strategy
    Then agent matches refugee skills to job availability
    And agent suggests phased integration by neighborhood
    And agent monitors integration outcomes for adjustment
    And Jamal ensures community voice in resettlement decisions
    And integration succeeds better than without coordination
    And Riverside demonstrates scalable humanitarian response

  Scenario: Municipal policy integration with protocol decisions
    Given city council passes new housing affordability ordinance
    And Municipal Elohim flags potential conflict with property protocols
    When conflict is identified
    Then Constitutional Council reviews constitutional alignment
    And council determines whether ordinance or protocol needs adjustment
    And Jamal facilitates resolution through democratic deliberation
    And city retains policy sovereignty within constitutional bounds
    And agents and elected government work as partners

  Scenario: Crisis coordination across municipal infrastructure
    Given opioid overdose cluster occurs in downtown
    When Municipal Elohim detects crisis pattern
    Then agent coordinates emergency services, health services, and social support
    And agent identifies who needs help across multiple systems
    And agent enables rapid mutual aid mobilization
    And Jamal maintains human judgment for crisis decisions
    And agents inform while humans decide under uncertainty
    And coordinated response saves lives

  Scenario: Monitor municipal wellbeing indicators for policy improvement
    Given Riverside has baseline data on wellbeing before protocol
    When Jamal reviews municipal dashboard annually
    Then dashboard shows life satisfaction trends across neighborhoods
    And dashboard reveals loneliness patterns and interventions
    And dashboard tracks economic resilience indicators
    And dashboard identifies neighborhoods struggling despite protocol
    And Jamal uses data to target policy interventions
    And evidence-based governance improves outcomes

  Scenario: Facilitate inter-neighborhood dialogue on shared challenges
    Given neighborhoods have conflicting priorities
    And downtown wants nightlife economy
    And residential areas want noise reduction
    When Municipal Elohim identifies the conflict
    Then Jamal convenes inter-neighborhood deliberative assembly
    And assembly uses Polis-style clustering to find common ground
    And assembly develops solution: nightlife district with sound barriers
    And neighborhoods collaborate rather than compete
    And municipal scale enables solutions impossible at neighborhood level

  Scenario: Coordinate with county and state on cross-boundary issues
    Given Riverside is part of larger regional ecosystem
    And watershed management crosses municipal boundaries
    When Jamal works on water allocation issues
    Then he coordinates with upstream and downstream municipalities
    And Municipal Elohim shares data with regional agents
    And multi-municipal deliberative assembly convenes
    And solution serves multiple jurisdictions
    And municipal leaders demonstrate lateral coordination
    And subsidiarity enables appropriate-scale problem solving
