Scenario: Privacy maintained while participating in neighborhood networks
    Given Margaret's financial situation is sensitive
    And neighborhood participation requires some visibility
    When Margaret's data contributes to neighborhood coordination
    Then her specific circumstances must remain private
    And only aggregated anonymized data should be shared
    And she should receive benefits without stigmatizing exposure
    And dignity should be preserved in all interactions
    And privacy should be balanced with community participation
    And the protocol should enable solidarity without surveillance
