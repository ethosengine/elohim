Scenario: Board member prepares for contentious development decision in special district
    Given transit district board must decide on major service expansion
    And developers advocate for routes serving new developments
    And existing riders advocate for frequency improvements on current routes
    And staff recommendation favors expansion over frequency
    When the board member uses Observer decision support
    Then they receive ridership data showing current overcrowding and reliability issues
    And see community benefits analysis comparing expansion versus improvement
    And access transportation equity analysis of who is served by each option
    And get examples of how peer transit districts approached similar trade-offs
    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment balancing competing interests
