Scenario: Municipal senior center programs that recognize continued productivity
    Given Margaret is active and engaged, not waiting to die
    And senior centers sometimes reinforce obsolescence narratives
    When the municipality_elohim connects Margaret to senior programs
    Then programs should treat seniors as productive contributors
    And opportunities should include volunteering, teaching, organizing
    And the focus should be engagement and contribution, not entertainment
    And Margaret should find programs that honor her capability
    And senior centers should be care economy hubs
    And municipal programs should support active aging
