Scenario: Learning about regenerative food systems
    Given current industrial food systems are extractive
    And regenerative agriculture can restore ecological health
    When I want to understand alternatives to industrial food
    Then the protocol should provide education about regenerative food systems
    And connect me to regenerative food initiatives in bioregion
    And help me envision food work that contributes to ecological restoration
    And support transformation toward care-economy-aligned food systems
