Scenario: Household budget management amid competing generational demands
    Given the household supports adult children financially
    And contributes to parents' care costs
    And maintains their own household
    And saves for retirement
    When household_elohim manages budget
    Then it should track spending across generational categories
    And surface when one category expands unsustainably
    And provide analysis: "Child support increased 40% last quarter while retirement savings decreased"
    And help them make conscious choices about allocation
    And recognize when external support is needed
    And support sustainable household financial management
    And prevent financial crisis from competing demands
