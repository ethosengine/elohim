# Stakeholder Roles: Who Participates in AI Governance

## Beyond "Users and Developers"

Traditional software has two main roles: people who build it and people who use it. AI governance requires a richer taxonomy.

Why? Because AI decisions affect people who never chose to interact with the system. The person denied a loan, the community subjected to predictive policing, the workers displaced by automation—they're stakeholders whether they signed up or not.

## The Stakeholder Map

### Appellants
**Who**: Anyone adversely affected by an AI decision
**Role**: Challenge specific decisions, surface problems
**Powers**: 
- File appeals at appropriate level
- Access explanation of decisions affecting them
- Participate in hearings about their cases

**For policy makers**: This role needs legal protection and accessible processes.

### Community Leaders
**Who**: Representatives of affected communities
**Role**: Aggregate concerns, represent collective interests
**Powers**:
- Propose agenda items for council review
- Participate in policy development
- Communicate between communities and governance bodies

**For influencers**: This might be you—translating between systems and the people they affect.

### Constitutional Council Members
**Who**: Appointed or elected oversight body members
**Role**: Set policy, review systemic issues, adjudicate appeals
**Powers**:
- Vote on constraint changes
- Commission investigations
- Modify system parameters

**For policy makers**: This is the governance role you understand—but applied to AI.

### Policy Makers
**Who**: Government officials, regulatory bodies
**Role**: Set legal framework, enforce compliance
**Powers**:
- Define mandatory requirements
- Investigate violations
- Impose penalties

**This is you**: The Elohim framework gives you levers that actually work at AI speed.

### Researchers
**Who**: Academic and independent researchers
**Role**: Study system behavior, identify problems, propose solutions
**Powers**:
- Access data for research (with appropriate protections)
- Publish findings
- Advise councils

**For developers**: This is the external validation that makes your systems trustworthy.

### Technical Experts
**Who**: Engineers, data scientists, AI researchers
**Role**: Implement constraints, evaluate feasibility, translate
**Powers**:
- Assess technical implications of proposed policies
- Implement approved changes
- Flag infeasibility or unintended consequences

**For developers**: This is your primary role—but accountable to the broader stakeholder system.

                              Technical Experts → implement → System
                                      ↓
                              [Feedback to Appellants]
```

No single role has complete authority. Each constrains and enables the others.

## The Elohim: Your AI Representative

Every individual in the Elohim system has an AI assistant—their personal Elohim. This assistant:
- Explains decisions that affect you
- Helps navigate governance processes
- Advocates for your interests within constitutional bounds
- Learns your values and context

**For content creators**: Imagine an AI that actually works for you, not for advertisers.

## Governance Layers

Stakeholder roles exist at every governance layer:

| Layer | Example Appellants | Example Councils |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Individual | Personal AI users | User-level constraints |
| Family | Family members | Household governance |
| Community | Neighborhood residents | Community councils |
| Municipal | City residents | Municipal AI oversight |
| Regional | State/province residents | Regional coordination |
| National | Citizens | National AI policy |
| Global | Everyone | Global commons governance |

## Getting Involved

You don't need to wait for the full system:
- **Policy makers**: Start requiring stakeholder input in AI procurement
- **Developers**: Build feedback mechanisms into your systems
- **Influencers**: Amplify affected community voices
- **Everyone**: Pay attention to AI decisions in your life

Constitutional AI governance starts with recognizing that you're a stakeholder.
