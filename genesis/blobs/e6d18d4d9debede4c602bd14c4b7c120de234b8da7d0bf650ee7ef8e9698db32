Scenario: Community accountability ensures democratic locations serve neighborhood needs
    Given franchise corporate ignored community needs in pursuit of profit maximization
    And locations had no mechanism for community input on operations
    When democratic governance includes community stakeholder participation
    Then neighborhood residents can attend stakeholder meetings and provide input
    And community concerns about impacts (environmental, traffic, employment) are heard
    And workers consider community feedback in democratic decision-making
    And accountability flows both ways (community and workers mutually accountable)
    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation protecting worker autonomy
