Scenario: Advocating for community support of workers
    Given workers are systematically underpaid and overworked
    When I want to advocate for community support of workers
    Then the protocol should help me organize advocacy
    And connect me with other workers for collective action
    And support pushing for living wage campaigns and worker protections
    And build community culture that values worker dignity
