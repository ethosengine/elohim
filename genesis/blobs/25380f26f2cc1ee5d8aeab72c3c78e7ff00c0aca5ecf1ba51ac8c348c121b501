Scenario: Voice guidance ensures accessibility for pre-readers
    Given Tommy is 5 and may have limited reading ability
    And accessibility is required for equitable education
    When Tommy uses the educational features of the scanner
    Then voice guidance should be available throughout
    And visual feedback should be primary
    And no reading ability should be required for core functionality
    And audio should be warm, encouraging, and developmentally appropriate
    And the system should be accessible to all children regardless of reading level
