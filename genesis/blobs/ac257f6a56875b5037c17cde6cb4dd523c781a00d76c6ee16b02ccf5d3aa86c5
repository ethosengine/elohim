Scenario: Accessible neighborhood events enable Alex's participation
    Given neighborhood events are often inaccessible
    And inaccessibility equals exclusion from community
    When neighborhood events are planned
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should prompt organizers about accessibility
    And it should provide checklist of access considerations
    And Alex should be consulted as accessibility expert
    And venues should be verified for wheelchair access, sensory accommodations
    And accessible events should become neighborhood norm
    And Alex should be able to participate fully in neighborhood life
    And inclusion should be proactive, not reactive
