Scenario: Local knowledge preservation through elderly memory keeping
    Given Helen remembers 40 years of neighborhood changes
    And this knowledge has cultural and practical value
    When neighborhood planning and decisions occur
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should surface Helen's historical knowledge
    And her memory of neighborhood patterns should inform planning
    And oral history should be captured for community archive
    And Helen should be recognized as neighborhood historian
    And her contribution to collective memory should be valued
    And the protocol should preserve local knowledge through elder participation
    And community memory should include longtime residents' perspectives
