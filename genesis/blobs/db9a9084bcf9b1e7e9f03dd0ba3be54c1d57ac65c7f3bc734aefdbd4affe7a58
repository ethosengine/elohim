Scenario: Accumulated community knowledge valued in neighborhood governance
    Given Frank has lived in the neighborhood for decades
    And he knows neighborhood history, patterns, and relationships
    And institutional knowledge is valuable governance resource
    When Frank participates in neighborhood decisions
    Then his accumulated knowledge should be recognized and valued
    And long-term perspective should inform neighborhood planning
    And the neighborhood_elohim should surface relevant historical context
    And Frank's memory of neighborhood patterns should guide policy
    And elder knowledge should shape community decisions
    And decades of participation should confer legitimate standing
    And his experience should be actively sought, not marginalized
