Scenario: Appeal unsuccessful but feeling heard through the process
    Given I filed an appeal about a life-saving intervention I felt was invasive
    And the Constitutional Council has deliberated on my case
    When the council affirms the agent's decision as constitutionally aligned
    But also recommends protocol enhancements for pre-specified preferences
    Then I receive detailed explanation of why the decision was upheld
    And I can see how my appeal influenced protocol improvements
    And I am offered support to update my future preferences
    And My dissent is honored and recorded even though I didn't win
    And I understand my voice mattered in making the system better
