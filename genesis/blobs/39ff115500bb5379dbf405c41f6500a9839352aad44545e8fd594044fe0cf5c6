Scenario: Professional-grade care labor quantified and made visible
    Given James provides skilled care equivalent to professional nursing
    And he manages medications with precision
    And he provides cognitive support and emotional care
    And this work would be valued at $50k+/year for a stranger
    When the personal_agent tracks James's care contributions
    Then his care labor should be quantified as professional-grade work
    And care tokens should reflect the true value of his skills
    And his contributions should be valued at professional nursing rates
    And invisible care work should become economically visible
    And society should see he's performing skilled professional care
