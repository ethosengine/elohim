Scenario: Volunteer care networks prevent institutional warehousing
    Given institutional care strips autonomy and dignity
    And community care networks can enable aging in place
    When volunteers provide support for Helen
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate volunteer schedules
    And volunteer care work should be recognized with care tokens
    And Helen should remain in her home and community
    And care should be provided with dignity and respect
    And the protocol should demonstrate alternative to institutional model
    And community care economy should prove that dignified elder care is possible at scale
    And success should show that we can care for our elders without warehousing them
