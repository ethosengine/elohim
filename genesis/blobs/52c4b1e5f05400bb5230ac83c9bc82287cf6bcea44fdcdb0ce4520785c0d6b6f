Scenario: Medical privacy protects Alex from unauthorized disclosure
    Given medical information is highly sensitive
    And disability status can lead to discrimination if disclosed
    When Alex's medical information is collected
    Then the personal_agent should ensure strict medical privacy
    And it should control what medical information is shared with whom
    And workplace should never receive medical details
    And family should only access what Alex permits
    And insurance should receive minimum necessary information
    And Alex's medical privacy should be maximally protected
    And the protocol should prevent unauthorized medical disclosure systematically
