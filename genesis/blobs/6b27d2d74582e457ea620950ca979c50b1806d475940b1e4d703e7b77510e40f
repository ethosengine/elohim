**Instructions:** (This section should have One-To-One applications with Minimizing Harmful Consequences)   
\* We must see ourselves as Christans in a universal sense, if we are growing because other smaller congregations aren't as resourced are as capable as we are, or poaching from other christian communities, does not count toward growth as a body.   
\-- As such, we should develop some ministry which seeks the development and success of other communities of christians, what we do well MUST be shared with the body, the full body of Christ.  
\-- Church planting, building campaigns, or relocating should regenrate places that we previously have been. (San Pedro \-\> Thousand Oaks)

\* We need to maximize the sustainability of our operations where we can, large buildings, debt-servicing (but provides loans and grants), huge energy bills (operate with renewable energy), transportation (make everywhere we for people first (walk, bike, tansit), deliver health-care, social services , risk-transfer (stabilize incomes).

\* We need a positive model for political discernment of the body which is judged by real measurable outcomes not lipservice to stated goals, we cannot be a community which serves the poor, prisoners, immigrants, orphans, and widows, while voting for a political representatives who impoverish, imprison, criminalize, orphan, and widow.  ( We cannot continue sinning, \[or advocate for consequences\], so that grace may abound )

\* Our lives must reflect our identity as christians,   
\--if we-members are working in industry that is generating externalities, we could dedicate capacity to helping people re-align their vocation with those values, without penalty or disruption.   
\--if we-members are living in such a way that is generating externalities (Parable of the Polygons), we should encourage people to make active choices and not rely on passive hope that someone will happen upon what a life well lived looks like.
