Scenario: Workers access transparent financial information previously hidden by corporate
    Given corporate kept financial information opaque to workers
    And workers now have complete financial transparency
    When workers access the financial dashboard
    Then they see real-time revenue, costs, and profit
    And they see exactly how much was previously extracted by franchise fees
    And they see supplier costs and markup comparisons
    And they see complete compensation breakdown for all workers
    And they can audit any financial transaction
    And workplace_elohim ensures financial literacy support for all workers
