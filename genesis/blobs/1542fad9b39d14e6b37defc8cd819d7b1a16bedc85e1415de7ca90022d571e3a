Scenario: Municipal resource allocation reflects care economy contributions
    Given Sarah and others contribute substantially to community care
    And municipal budgets allocate significant resources
    When municipal budgets are decided
    Then care economy contributions should be visible to decision makers
    And resource allocation should recognize care creates value
    And neighborhoods with strong care economy should receive support
    And municipal investment should strengthen care economy infrastructure
    And budgets should reflect that care work is economically valuable
