Scenario: Collaborating with Dr. Chen on global sortition research
    Given Dr. Chen presents research on constitutional council effectiveness
    And my technical expertise complements his social science
    When I help explain technical aspects of his findings
    Then I clarify: how technical design enables or constrains democratic oversight
    And I interpret: patterns in agent-council interactions
    And I assess: whether technical systems adequately support citizen governance
    And I respect: his authority on democratic theory and outcomes
    And we integrate: technical and social understanding
    And we serve: evidence-based global constitutional deliberation
    And we demonstrate: interdisciplinary collaboration
