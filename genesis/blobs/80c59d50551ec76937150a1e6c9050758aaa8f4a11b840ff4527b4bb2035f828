Scenario: Organizing for universal benefits in food service
    Given many food service workers lack health insurance, paid leave, or retirement
    When workers advocate for universal benefits
    Then the protocol should support campaigns for mandatory benefits
    And help workers articulate need for healthcare, sick leave, and security
    And coordinate advocacy for industry-wide benefit requirements
    And push for decoupling essential benefits from individual employer provision
