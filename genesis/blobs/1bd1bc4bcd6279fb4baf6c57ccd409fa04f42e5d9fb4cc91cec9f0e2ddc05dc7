Scenario: Adult children supported in independence while teaching care economy
    Given Robert's children ages 19 and 22 are establishing independence
    And Robert provides financial support, guidance, and care economy education
    When family_elohim tracks the parent-adult child relationship
    Then it should recognize Robert's support contributions
    And help him teach care economy principles to his children
    And surface opportunities: "Jordan could help coordinate grandmother's birthday celebration"
    And model multigenerational care reciprocity for the next generation
    And support the transition from parenting to adult partnership
    And help his children learn that care flows in multiple directions
    And prepare them to eventually care for him
