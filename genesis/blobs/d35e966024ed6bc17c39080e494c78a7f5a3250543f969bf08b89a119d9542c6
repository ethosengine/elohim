Scenario: Accessing neighborhood food resources during tight budget periods
    Given neighborhood has community gardens, food co-ops, or meal programs
    And my budget is extremely tight some periods
    When I need food support
    Then the protocol should connect me to neighborhood food resources
    And help me access support with dignity based on my care contributions
    And recognize that my work serves community (I am not taking charity)
    And facilitate reciprocal care economy participation
