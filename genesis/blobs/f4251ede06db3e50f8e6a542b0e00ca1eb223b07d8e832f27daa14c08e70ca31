Scenario: Multigenerational family care patterns include teen as contributor
    Given Jasmine's grandmother requires increasing care support
    And the family is coordinating care across generations
    When Jasmine contributes to grandmother's care
    Then her care work should be tracked and valued
    And the family_elohim should coordinate care across three generations
    And Jasmine should learn that care flows in multiple directions
    And her care for grandmother should build toward her understanding of lifecycle care
    And the family should model care economy across the full lifespan
    And Jasmine's generation should learn that elder care is shared family responsibility
