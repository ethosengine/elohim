Scenario: Learning new technology to stay connected
    Given Margaret needs technology skills for modern life
    And digital divide affects seniors disproportionately
    When the educational_elohim provides technology education
    Then senior-appropriate technology training should be available
    And teaching should be patient and non-patronizing
    And Margaret should learn at her own pace
    And technology should be taught as tool for connection and autonomy
    And digital literacy should be senior right, not privilege
    And education should prevent technology-based isolation
