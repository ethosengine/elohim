Scenario: Building international coalition resisting corporate capture
    Given corporations lobby internationally for favorable regulation
    And they use different nations to triangulate pressure
    When I coordinate with international policy maker allies
    Then we share: intelligence about lobbying tactics
    And we coordinate: resistance to capture attempts
    And we establish: transparency requirements for global lobbying
    And we support: each other under corporate pressure
    And we create: race-to-top rather than race-to-bottom
    And we demonstrate: democratic solidarity across nations
    And we protect: protocol sovereignty through collective action
