Scenario: Identifying emerging issues through annual evaluation cycles
    Given I analyze regional data annually to track trends
    And I want to identify problems before they become crises
    When I examine this year's patterns compared to previous years
    Then I notice: appeal rates trending up (good—people know recourse exists)
    And I identify: recurring adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging
    And I detect: systematic issue with business loan evaluation criteria
    And I recognize: elderly accessibility remaining challenging
    And I flag: potential issues for community leaders and policymakers
    And My timely analysis enables: proactive response to emerging challenges
    And Research provides: early warning system for governance problems
