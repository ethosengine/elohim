Scenario: Council member tracks accountability commitments systematically
    Given the politician made campaign promises to constituents
    And committed to specific actions in community meetings
    When the Observer monitors commitment tracking
    Then they receive alerts when deadlines approach
    And see status of all promises made across forums
    And get nudges to follow through on community pledges
    And build constituent trust through documented delivery
    And maintain integrity against overwhelming office demands
