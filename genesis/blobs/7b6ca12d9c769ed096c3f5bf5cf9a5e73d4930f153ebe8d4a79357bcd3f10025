Scenario: Distinguishing ecological care from greenwashing
    Given many products and institutions claim environmental responsibility falsely
    And Kenji needs to distinguish genuine ecological care from marketing
    When the bioregional_elohim helps Kenji evaluate environmental claims
    Then it should teach him to recognize greenwashing
    And it should help him identify genuinely sustainable practices
    And it should build critical ecological literacy
    And it should protect him from false environmental marketing
    And the system should teach sophisticated ecological analysis
    And Kenji should distinguish real care economy from extractive economy in green clothing
