Scenario: Parent challenges state funding formula
    Given the parent learns state funding shortchanges their district
    And wonders why their child's school lacks basic resources
    When the parent reviews Observer's state funding analysis
    Then they see their district receives $3,000 less per student
    And understand state formula creates massive inequities
    And learn this explains overcrowded classes and cut programs
    And connect with parents in other underfunded districts statewide
    And parent advocacy expands to state-level funding reform
