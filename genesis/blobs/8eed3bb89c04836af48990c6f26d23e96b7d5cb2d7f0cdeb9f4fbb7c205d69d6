Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces household costs
    Given Margaret has tools, skills, and time
    And she has limited budget for purchasing services
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates resource sharing
    Then Margaret should share tools she owns but neighbors need
    And she should borrow tools she needs occasionally
    And skill sharing should reduce need for paid services
    And neighborhood tool library should benefit all members
    And Margaret's resources should be accessible to community
    And she should access neighbors' resources when needed
