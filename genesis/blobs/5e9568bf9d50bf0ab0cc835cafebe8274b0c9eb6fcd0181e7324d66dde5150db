Scenario: Investor advocacy spreads community investment model to neighbors
    Given most community members don't know democratic investment options exist
    And Patricia's neighbors invest in stock market by default
    When she shares community investment experience
    Then neighbors learn about values-aligned local investment opportunities
    And some redirect capital from stock market to community investment pool
    And investment pool grows enabling more democratic conversions
    And movement builds through investor advocacy and demonstration
    And community_elohim supports investor education and community outreach
