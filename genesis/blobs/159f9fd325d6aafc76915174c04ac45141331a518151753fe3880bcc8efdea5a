Scenario: Voting on constitutional amendments after deep deliberation
    Given we have deliberated for months on proposed amendments
    And I have learned from thousands of fellow citizens
    When we vote on amendments to global constitution
    Then my vote: carries equal weight to every other delegate
    And I vote: based on my judgment informed by deliberation
    And I know: my decision will affect billions of people
    And I feel: weight of democratic responsibility
    And I trust: the collective wisdom of this assembly
    And I accept: that we might be wrong but must still choose
    And I participate: in most consequential democratic act of my life
    And I fulfill: citizenship at planetary scale
