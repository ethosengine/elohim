Scenario: Farm financial transparency builds trust and informed decision-making
    Given farmworkers previously had no visibility into farm finances
    And lack of transparency created distrust and uninformed compensation discussions
    When democratic governance requires financial transparency
    Then farmworkers see complete financial picture: revenue, costs, margins, investments
    And compensation decisions are informed by transparent profit distribution
    And financial education is provided helping workers understand farm economics
    And trust builds through transparency replacing suspicion from opacity
    And workplace_elohim provides financial transparency dashboards for democratic governance
