Scenario: Parent advocates for school safety investments
    Given the parent worries about school safety and emergency preparedness
    And board discusses "safety measures" in vague terms
    When the parent reviews Observer's safety policy analysis
    Then they see which safety measures are evidence-based vs security theater
    And understand budget allocations for counselors vs surveillance
    And learn about trauma-informed approaches to school safety
    And can advocate for measures that actually protect children
    And school safety policy centers student wellbeing not punishment
