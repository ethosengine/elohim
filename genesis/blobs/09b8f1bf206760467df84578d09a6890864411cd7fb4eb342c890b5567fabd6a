Scenario: Workplace boundaries protect time for parenting responsibilities
    Given Sarah has legitimate parenting obligations
    And work often encroaches on family time
    When the workplace_elohim monitors work-life boundaries
    Then it should flag when work is consuming family time
    And it should help Sarah protect necessary parenting time
    And it should validate that parenting obligations are real constraints
    And the system should support boundary-setting with employer
    And workplace demands should not be allowed to destroy family care
    And Sarah should be empowered to say no to overwork
