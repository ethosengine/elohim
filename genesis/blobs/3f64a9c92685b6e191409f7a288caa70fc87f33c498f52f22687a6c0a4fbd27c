Scenario: Safety and well-being observation for neighborhood children
    Given Margaret is often outside with grandchildren
    And she observes neighborhood children's activities and safety
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks child safety contributions
    Then it should recognize Margaret's informal supervision
    And it should value her care for neighborhood children's well-being
    And her presence should contribute to collective childcare
    And neighborhood children should benefit from elder attention
    And Margaret's observation should be recognized as care work
    And neighborhood should be safer because of engaged elders
