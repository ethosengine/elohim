Scenario: Parent evaluates school board candidate positions
    Given school board election is approaching
    And three candidates claim to "support children and families"
    When the parent reviews Observer's candidate comparison
    Then they see each candidate's voting record on key issues
    And understand positions on class sizes, teacher pay, program funding
    And view candidates' funding sources and potential conflicts
    And can make informed vote in 15 minutes during lunch break
    And parent participation strengthens education democracy
