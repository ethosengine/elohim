Scenario: Presenting to 10,000 global citizens on superintelligence governance
    Given Global Constitutional Convention deliberates superintelligent AI oversight
    And I am invited to provide technical expert testimony
    When I address delegates from every nation and culture
    Then I explain: what "superintelligence" means technically
    And I clarify: when agents might exceed human comprehension
    And I present: technical mechanisms for constitutional alignment
    And I explore: whether "explain-down" capability is possible
    And I acknowledge: deep uncertainty about solvability
    And I translate: across language and cultural barriers
    And I demonstrate: how expertise serves global democracy
