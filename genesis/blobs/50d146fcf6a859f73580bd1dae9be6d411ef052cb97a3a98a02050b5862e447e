Scenario: Child prevented from exposure to inappropriate content
    Given Emma participates in the manga community
    When an older teen posts art with mature themes
    And the content is not appropriate for younger members
    Then the guardian agent prevents Emma from seeing the mature content
    And the moderator is notified to evaluate the post
    And age-appropriate content guidelines are reinforced
    And Emma's experience remains safe and appropriate to her development
    And the older teen receives guidance about age-appropriate spaces
