    And the agent should say "Five other families bought this brand this week—they're all trying to eat healthier"
    And Emma should learn her choices are part of larger patterns
    And she should understand individual agency connects to collective outcomes
    And community context should expand her economic understanding
    And she should see herself as part of care economy ecosystem
