Scenario: Building care economy capital for future aging needs
    Given Frank is watching his mother-in-law navigate advanced aging
    And he recognizes his own future care needs will increase
    When Frank makes care contributions now
    Then care tokens should accumulate to his individual account
    And these tokens should represent future care economy resources
    And the system should help him build reciprocal relationships
    And he should be preparing for increased care needs in 10-20 years
    And current contributions should create legitimate claims on future support
    And Frank should experience agency in planning his own aging
    And care reciprocity should flow across time
