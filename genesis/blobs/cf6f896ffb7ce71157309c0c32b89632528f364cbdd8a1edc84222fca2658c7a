Scenario: Community care tokens enable resource access based on contribution
    Given Sarah has accumulated care tokens through community participation
    And community resources are allocated based on care contributions
    When Sarah needs community support
    Then her care tokens should give her access to resources
    And community mutual aid should be available
    And support should be based on demonstrated contribution
    And care economy should function as community resource system
    And Sarah's care work should have tangible value
