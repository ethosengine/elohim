Scenario: Recognizing paid work as community care contribution
    Given I work 50+ hours per week preparing food for people
    And my labor serves community nourishment and flourishing
    When the community assesses care contributions
    Then the protocol should recognize my work as care labor
    And accumulate care tokens reflecting my service to community
    And make visible that all work serving others is care economy participation
    And reframe employment from pure extraction to community contribution
