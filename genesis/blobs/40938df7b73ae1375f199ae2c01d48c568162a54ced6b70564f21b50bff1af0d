Scenario: Creating household care agreements
    Given household members need clear expectations
    When we establish how we'll manage shared living
    Then the protocol should help us create care agreements
    And document who does what and when
    And include flexibility for my irregular schedule
    And provide framework for fair and sustainable cooperation
