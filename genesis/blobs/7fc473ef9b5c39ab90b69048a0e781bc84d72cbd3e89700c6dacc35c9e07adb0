    Given Frank learned to invest in quality tools and materials
    And durability reduces waste and manufacturing impact
    When Frank makes purchasing decisions
    Then his personal_agent should support quality-over-quantity choices
    And the bioregional_elohim should track durability practices
    And buying quality should be recognized as ecological stewardship
    And Frank's knowledge of durability should inform others
    And throwaway culture should be countered by his construction wisdom
    And consumption patterns should favor longevity and repairability
