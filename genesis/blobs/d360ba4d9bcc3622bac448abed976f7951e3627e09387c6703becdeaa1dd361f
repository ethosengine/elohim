Scenario: Council member exposes budget priorities misaligned with constituent needs
    Given the politician suspects budget doesn't reflect community priorities
    When the Observer analyzes municipal spending patterns
    Then they see infrastructure investment concentrated in affluent neighborhoods
    And identify underinvestment in working-class areas
    And calculate service delivery disparities by district
    And present evidence-based budget amendments
    And advocate for equitable resource distribution
