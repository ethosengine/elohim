Scenario: Board member evaluates superintendent recommendation to close schools
    Given superintendent recommends closing three schools for efficiency
    And 200-page closure analysis emphasizes cost savings and facility utilization
    And affected communities organized opposition but lack data to counter staff analysis
    When the board member requests Observer independent analysis
    Then they receive impact assessment showing commute time increases for affected families
    And see enrollment data contradicting claims of declining student numbers
    And access demographic analysis showing closures disproportionately affect low-income students
    And get comparison of how peer districts addressed facility challenges without closure
    And independent analysis reveals information staff presentation minimized
