## 1 Corinthians 1:25-29

> 1 Corinthians 1:25-29: Highlights the contrast between human wisdom and divine wisdom, pointing out that God's "foolishness" is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is stronger than human strength. This echoes the call for a wisdom and prudence beyond our own capabilities.
