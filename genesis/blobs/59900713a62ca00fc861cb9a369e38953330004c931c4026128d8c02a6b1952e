Scenario: Municipal aging infrastructure influenced by sandwich generation
    Given Robert manages care for both aging parents and adult children
    And he understands infrastructure needs across lifecycle
    And municipal aging infrastructure often inadequate
    When municipal_elohim supports aging infrastructure advocacy
    Then it should connect Robert to municipal aging policy development
    And help him advocate for adult day care, senior centers, home health support, and transportation
    And surface gaps in current municipal aging infrastructure
    And support him in testifying about infrastructure needs
    And build municipal systems that support aging with dignity
    And demonstrate that aging infrastructure benefits entire community
    And create municipalities where aging is supported, not hidden
