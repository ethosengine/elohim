Scenario: Transportation justice connects disability and environmental advocacy
    Given accessible public transit reduces both carbon emissions and disability barriers
    And transportation is both disability rights and environmental issue
    When transportation systems are reformed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should advocate for accessible sustainable transit
    And Alex's transit needs should align with environmental goals
    And accessible transit should be framed as climate solution
    And disability advocates and environmentalists should work together
    And the protocol should facilitate transportation justice coalitions
    And Alex's advocacy for accessible transit serves both causes
    And sustainable transportation must include disability access
