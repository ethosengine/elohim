Scenario: Politician tracks accountability for job creation commitments
    Given the politician approved tax incentives for business expansion
    And company promised specific job creation and wage levels
    When the Observer monitors economic development outcomes
    Then they see actual jobs created versus commitments
    And track whether wages meet promised levels
    And identify whether company hires local workers versus imports
    And receive alerts when company fails to meet obligations
    And enforce accountability provisions or recapture subsidies
