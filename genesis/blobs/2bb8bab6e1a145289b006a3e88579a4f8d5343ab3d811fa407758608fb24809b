Scenario: Building abstract thinking through real economic complexity
    Given Marcus is developing abstract thinking capacity
    And he's managing genuinely complex resource coordination
    When Marcus plans across time and context
    Then he should be building sophisticated cognitive capabilities
    And the personal_agent should support abstract planning
    And he should understand opportunity costs through real experience
    And complex systems thinking should develop through practice
    And his cognitive development should be supported by real challenges
    And abstract economic concepts should be learned through application
