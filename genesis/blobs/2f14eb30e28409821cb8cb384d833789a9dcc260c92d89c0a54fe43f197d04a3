Scenario: Board member tracks implementation of previous transportation policy
    Given board voted two years ago to optimize bus routes for efficiency
    And transportation director promised improved reliability and cost savings
    And parents increasingly complain about late buses and long routes
    When the board member checks Observer implementation tracking
    Then they see on-time performance has actually declined since policy change
    And discover cost savings didn't materialize as promised
    And find low-income neighborhoods disproportionately affected by route changes
    And access parent feedback data showing systematic reliability problems
    And impact tracking reveals staff promises diverged from actual outcomes
