Scenario: Sustainable building practices in Habitat construction work
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week in construction
    And building practices have significant environmental impact
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks Frank's construction work
    Then it should recognize opportunities for sustainable building techniques
    And suggest energy-efficient construction methods
    And facilitate use of recycled or sustainable materials
    And help Frank apply his skills to ecological building
    And quantify environmental benefit of sustainable construction choices
    And recognize that his labor can serve both housing and ecological goals
    And Habitat work should model sustainable building practices
