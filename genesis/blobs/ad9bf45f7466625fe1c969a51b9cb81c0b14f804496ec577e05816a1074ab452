Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates genuine sustainability commitment
    Given a developer builds with high environmental standards
    And wants sustainability track record to be visible and valued
    When the Observer documents environmental performance
    Then the developer shows: LEED Platinum certification on 8 of 10 projects
    And stormwater management exceeds regulatory requirements by 40%
    And green infrastructure investment totals $4M beyond minimum requirements
    And environmental commitments were kept not just promised
    And genuine sustainability creates market differentiation
