Scenario: Municipal small business support programs incorporate democratic conversion pathways
    Given city offers small business loans, technical assistance, and development support
    And these programs could facilitate democratic conversions
    When municipality recognizes conversion potential for struggling businesses
    Then small business support programs add worker ownership conversion option
    And struggling owners learn they can exit with dignity while protecting workers
    And municipal economic development staff are trained in democratic transition support
    And public resources help overcome conversion barriers (legal costs, financing, technical assistance)
    And municipality_elohim provides conversion expertise to municipal programs
