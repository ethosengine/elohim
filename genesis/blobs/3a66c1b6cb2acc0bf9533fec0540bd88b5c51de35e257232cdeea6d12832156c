Scenario: Single parent mutual aid network provides peer support and resources
    Given Maria shares specific challenges with other single parents
    And they can support each other in ways non-single-parents cannot
    When Maria connects to community single parent networks
    Then the community_elohim should facilitate single parent mutual aid
    And it should coordinate resource sharing specific to solo parenting needs
    And it should enable peer support among those with lived experience
    And single parent network should provide understanding and practical help
    And Maria should have community that truly comprehends solo parenting reality
