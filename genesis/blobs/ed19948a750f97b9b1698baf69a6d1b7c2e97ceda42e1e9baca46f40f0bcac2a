Scenario: Environmental care literacy appropriate to concrete operations
    Given care economy extends to ecological relationships
    And Emma can understand concrete environmental concepts
    When Emma learns about environmental impact through scanner
    Then ecological care should be presented at age-appropriate level
    And the agent should say "This packaging can be recycled" (concrete)
    And abstract sustainability concepts should be avoided
    And connections between caring for people and planet should begin
    And Emma should develop environmental consciousness
    And ecological stewardship foundations should be laid for future development
