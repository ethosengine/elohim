Scenario: Workplace accommodations legally required and systematically tracked
    Given Alex requires specific workplace accommodations
    And accommodations are legally mandated under ADA
    When Alex requests workplace accommodations
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex document accommodation requests
    And it should track whether employer provides required accommodations
    And it should maintain records of all accommodation-related communications
    And Alex should have documentation to support legal action if necessary
    And the protocol should recognize that accommodation is right, not favor
    And Alex should be supported in asserting legal rights
    And workplace obligations should be clearly documented
