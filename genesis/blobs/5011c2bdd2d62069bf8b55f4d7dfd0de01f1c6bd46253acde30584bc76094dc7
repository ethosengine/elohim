Scenario: Shared living space decisions preserve elderly authority
    Given Helen's daughter occasionally stays to provide care
    And Helen's home is multigenerational at times
    When household decisions need to be made
    Then Helen's authority in her own home should be paramount
    And family members should defer to her household preferences
    And the household_elohim should mediate conflicting preferences
    And Helen's long-standing patterns should have priority
    And she should not feel like she's lost control of her space
    And care recipients should not become subordinate in their own homes
    And the protocol should preserve hierarchy: this is Helen's home
