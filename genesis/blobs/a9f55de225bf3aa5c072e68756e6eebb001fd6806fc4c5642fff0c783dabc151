Scenario: Employment board member tracks implementation of living wage policy
    Given board approved living wage requirement for city contractors two years ago
    And staff reports successful implementation and compliance
    And community advocates report ongoing wage violations by contractors
    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking
    Then they see contractor wage data showing compliance rates over time
    And discover enforcement gaps allowing violations to persist
    And find workers at some contractors still earning below living wage
    And access comparison to peer cities with stronger enforcement mechanisms
    And impact tracking reveals gap between policy adoption and actual outcomes
