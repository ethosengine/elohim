Scenario: Appeal mental health intervention with privacy concerns
    Given my Family Elohim has alerted my partner about concerning behavioral changes
    And I believe this is an invasion of my privacy
    And I was not in immediate danger
    When I file an appeal through my interface
    And I state my complaint in my own words: "This felt like surveillance"
    Then the appeal is immediately logged with timestamp and cryptographic proof
    And I receive confirmation with appeal tracking number
    And the agent provides its full reasoning transparently
    And I can see the pattern detection logic, confidence levels, and constitutional weighting
    And the appeal is scheduled for Community Elohim review within 24 hours
    And I am notified of my rights including escalation options
