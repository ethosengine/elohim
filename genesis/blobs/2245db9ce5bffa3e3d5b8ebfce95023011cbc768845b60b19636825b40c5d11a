Scenario: Politician tracks accountability for education reform implementation
    Given the politician championed reading improvement initiative
    And allocated funding for evidence-based interventions
    When the Observer monitors implementation and outcomes
    Then they see which schools implement reforms with fidelity
    And track reading proficiency changes after intervention
    And identify schools where implementation stalled or failed
    And understand barriers to effective implementation
    And intervene to ensure funding translates to student outcomes
