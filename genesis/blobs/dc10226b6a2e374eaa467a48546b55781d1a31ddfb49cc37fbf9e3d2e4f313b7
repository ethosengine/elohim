Scenario: Making major life decisions under extreme stress
    Given I need to make important decisions about housing, employment, or children's needs
    And I am traumatized, exhausted, and overwhelmed
    When I need to evaluate my options
    Then my personal_agent helps me process complex information
    And breaks down overwhelming decisions into manageable steps
    And provides decision support without making decisions for me
    And helps me identify my priorities and values
    And surfaces relevant information at the right time
    And prevents decision paralysis without overriding my agency
    And validates that my stress is reasonable given my circumstances
    And trusts that I can make good decisions with appropriate support
