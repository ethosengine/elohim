Scenario: Building adult financial capability through practice
    Given Jasmine manages portions of her household budget
    And she has responsibility for weekly grocery shopping
    And her family has allocated $100/week for her to manage
    When Jasmine makes purchasing decisions
    Then her personal_agent should track spending against budget
    And provide analysis of value optimization
    And highlight patterns: "You've stayed within budget 7 of 8 weeks"
    And surface learning opportunities: "Buying bulk rice saved $12 this month"
    And build sophisticated financial literacy through real practice
    And scaffold her capability without removing decision-making authority
