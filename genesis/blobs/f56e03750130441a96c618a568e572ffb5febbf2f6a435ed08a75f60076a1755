Feature: Industry Sector Coordination and Solidarity for Worker
  As a worker in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the industry_sector governance layer
  I want to coordinate with workers across businesses for collective power
  So that we build sector-wide solidarity and resist race-to-bottom pressures

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And multiple food service EAE entities exist across the region
    And the industry_sector governance context is active
    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates cross-business collaboration

  Scenario: Workers share best practices across EAE food service entities
    Given Maria has developed effective training methods at ChickenMax
    And Garden Bowl Express is onboarding new workers
    When Maria's training patterns are documented by REA system
    Then industry_sector_elohim identifies the transferable practice
    And Garden Bowl workers are notified of Maria's successful training approach
    And Maria is invited to conduct cross-entity training session
    And her expertise benefits the entire food service sector
    And Maria receives compensation for sector contribution

  Scenario: Workers coordinate sector-wide minimum standards
    Given different EAE food entities have varying wage and benefit levels
    And workers want to prevent race-to-bottom competition
    When food service sector workers hold coordination meeting
    Then workers from multiple entities propose sector minimum wage ($18/hour)
    And workers deliberate on benefits standards (paid sick leave, health insurance)
    And sector workers vote to adopt coordinated minimums
    And industry_sector_elohim helps enforce standards across network
    And local entities can exceed minimums but not undercut them

  Scenario: Workers provide mutual aid across businesses during crisis
    Given ChickenMax experiences unexpected staffing shortage
    And Garden Bowl Express has capacity to help
    When ChickenMax requests temporary worker support
    Then industry_sector_elohim coordinates cross-entity worker loan
    And Garden Bowl workers volunteer to help ChickenMax for two weeks
    And compensation is shared fairly between entities
    And Maria trains Garden Bowl workers on ChickenMax operations
    And sector solidarity prevents individual business failures

  Scenario: Workers collectively negotiate with suppliers for better terms
    Given individual EAE entities have limited purchasing power
    And workers want fair prices and quality ingredients
    When sector workers coordinate procurement
    Then industry_sector_elohim aggregates demand across food entities
    And workers collectively negotiate with Johnson Farm for volume pricing
    And sector workers secure better prices than individual entities could
    And all participating entities benefit from collective bargaining
    And sector purchasing power rivals corporate chains without exploitation

  Scenario: Workers share customer demand patterns for collective benefit
    Given Emma notices increasing demand for vegan options at ChickenMax
    And other food entities are also seeing this trend
    When REA systems document customer preference patterns
    Then industry_sector_elohim aggregates sector-wide demand data
    And workers across entities learn of vegan demand trend
    And sector coordinates with suppliers for plant-based ingredients
    And workers collaborate on vegan menu development
    And sector responds to customer needs faster than corporate competitors

  Scenario: Workers coordinate sector response to corporate competitive pressure
    Given a corporate chain attempts to undercut EAE entities on price
    And individual entities cannot match corporate predatory pricing alone
    When workers detect the competitive threat
    Then industry_sector_elohim alerts all sector workers
    And workers coordinate response emphasizing quality and values
    And workers develop public narrative about democratic vs. extractive business
    And sector pools marketing resources to compete collectively
    And coordinated response succeeds where isolated entities would fail

  Scenario: Workers transfer between EAE entities with portable expertise recognition
    Given DeShawn has accumulated 3 years of documented expertise at ChickenMax
    And he wants to move to Garden Bowl Express for career growth
    When DeShawn applies for position at Garden Bowl
    Then his ChickenMax REA profile is recognized across network
    And his skill tokens are valid at Garden Bowl
    And his seniority partially transfers based on sector contribution
    And Garden Bowl workers welcome him as proven contributor
    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates fair transition for both entities

  Scenario: Workers build sector-wide safety standards exceeding legal minimums
    Given different entities have varying safety protocols
    And workers prioritize safety over corporate-style speedup
    When sector workers establish safety working group
    Then workers from multiple entities share safety best practices
    And workers collectively develop sector safety standards
    And standards exceed legal minimums in key areas
    And industry_sector_elohim monitors compliance across sector
    And sector reputation for safety becomes competitive advantage

  Scenario: Workers coordinate political advocacy for democratic business policies
    Given municipal government is considering economic development policies
    And workers want policies supporting democratic ownership
    When sector workers organize advocacy campaign
    Then workers from multiple EAE entities testify at city council
    And workers present data on democratic business benefits
    And workers advocate for procurement preferences and tax incentives
    And coordinated worker voice influences policy more than isolated entities
    And sector political power protects and expands democratic economy

  Scenario: Workers learn specialized skills through sector apprenticeship program
    Given different EAE entities have different specialty expertise
    And Emma wants to learn about grain milling at Garden Bowl
    When Emma applies for sector cross-training opportunity
    Then industry_sector_elohim matches her interest with Garden Bowl capacity
    And Emma spends two weeks learning grain milling alongside ChickenMax work
    And both entities benefit from cross-pollination of expertise
    And Emma returns with new skills enhancing ChickenMax operations
    And sector-wide learning builds collective capability

  Scenario: Workers coordinate industry response to supply chain disruption
    Given tomato blight affects regional supply from Johnson Farm
    And individual entities would struggle with ingredient shortage
    When industry_sector_elohim detects the disruption
    Then sector workers coordinate menu adjustments across all entities
    And workers share alternative supplier relationships
    And entities with surplus inventory support those with shortages
    And sector responds collectively to minimize customer impact
    And coordinated resilience prevents business failures and worker layoffs
