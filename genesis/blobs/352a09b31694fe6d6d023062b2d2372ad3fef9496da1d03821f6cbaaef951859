Scenario: Building lifelong environmental stewardship practices
    Given Aisha's consumption patterns will span decades
    And early adult habits shape lifelong practices
    When Aisha develops consumption patterns
    Then the bioregional_elohim should support sustainable habits
    And it should help her establish environmentally responsible practices
    And patterns developed now should serve her throughout life
    And environmental stewardship should become second nature
    And her generation should normalize ecological responsibility
    And sustainable consumption should be her baseline expectation
