Scenario: Teacher challenges standardized assessment overemphasis
    Given standardized testing dominates education policy decisions
    And teachers know tests measure narrow slice of learning
    When teachers provide professional perspective on assessment through Observer
    Then teachers show how test prep narrows curriculum and reduces rich learning
    And document student stress and declining engagement with testing
    And present comprehensive assessment approaches that inform teaching
    And build parent coalition around learning-centered not test-centered education
    And assessment policy reflects professional expertise about student learning
