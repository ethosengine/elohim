Scenario: Student contribution to peer learning community
    Given Kenji helps classmates understand difficult concepts
    And peer teaching strengthens everyone's learning
    When the educational_elohim tracks peer teaching
    Then it should recognize Kenji's teaching labor as care contribution
    And it should accumulate care tokens for tutoring peers
    And it should value "Kenji explained organic chemistry to 3 struggling classmates"
    And peer education should be recognized as community care work
    And the system should make student teaching labor visible
    And intellectual generosity should be valued and encouraged
