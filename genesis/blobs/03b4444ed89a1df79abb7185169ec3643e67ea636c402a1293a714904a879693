Scenario: Resisting corporate lobbying for regulatory capture
    Given tech companies lobby for regulations favoring incumbents
    And they push: backdoor mandates, centralization requirements, licensing barriers
    When I defend protocol sovereignty against capture
    Then I use: cryptographic impossibility arguments (backdoors break verification)
    And I present: evidence that regulation would harm innovation
    And I coalition: with community leaders showing grassroots opposition
    And I reference: international examples of protocol sovereignty working
    And I require: transparency about lobbying and funding
    And I resist: well-funded pressure through political courage
    And I protect: democratic governance from corporate control
