Scenario: Creating precedent for global crisis coordination
    Given convention addresses how protocol handles planetary emergencies
    And we must balance speed with democratic legitimacy
    When we deliberate crisis governance framework
    Then we establish: emergency protocols maintaining accountability
    And we specify: what constitutes legitimate crisis triggering special powers
    And we create: rapid review processes for crisis decisions
    And we ensure: democratic oversight even under urgency
    And we prevent: crisis from becoming excuse for authoritarian drift
    And we establish: how humanity governs together under existential threat
    And we demonstrate: democracy can be both deliberative and responsive
