Scenario: Parent challenges school boundary changes
    Given the district proposes "boundary realignment for efficiency"
    And the parent's child would be moved to a different school
    When the parent reviews Observer's impact analysis
    Then they see which neighborhoods are most affected
    And understand this separates siblings between different schools
    And view maps showing longer commutes for certain families
    And connect with other parents facing same disruption
    And coordinate testimony about family impacts at boundary hearing
