Scenario: Pesticide reduction improves ecosystem and human health bioregionally
    Given pesticide use harms pollinators, water quality, farmworker health, and ecosystems
    And individual farms face pest pressure requiring coordinated management
    When democratic farms coordinate integrated pest management bioregionally
    Then pesticide use decreases through ecological pest control methods
    And farmworker health improves from reduced chemical exposure
    And pollinator populations recover from pesticide reduction
    And ecosystem health improves measurably across bioregion
