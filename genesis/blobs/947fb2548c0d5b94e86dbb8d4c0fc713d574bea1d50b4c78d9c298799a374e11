Scenario: Community education recognizes invisible care economy scale
    Given community members don't understand family caregiver reality
    And invisibility perpetuates lack of support
    When the community_elohim demonstrates care economy scale
    Then it should show family caregivers provide $470 billion/year nationally
    And it should quantify caregiving in local community specifically
    And community should recognize dependence on invisible care work
    And education should transform attitudes toward family caregiving
    And visibility should drive policy changes supporting caregivers
