Scenario: Organizer builds coalition for culturally responsive curriculum
    Given families want curriculum reflecting their communities' histories
    And multiple cultural groups share this interest
    When the organizer uses Observer to facilitate coalition building
    Then they identify parents from different backgrounds with aligned goals
    And coordinate around shared demands for curriculum inclusion
    And help families develop specific proposals with supporting evidence
    And organize testimony showcasing diverse community voices
    And coalition transforms individual requests into collective power
