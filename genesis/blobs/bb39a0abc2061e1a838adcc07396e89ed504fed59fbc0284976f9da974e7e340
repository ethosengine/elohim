Scenario: Analyzing appeal patterns to understand constitutional interpretation
    Given Riverside's Constitutional Council has reviewed 150 appeals over three years
    And I have access to anonymized appeal data
    When I analyze patterns in appeal types, outcomes, and reasoning
    Then I identify: which decisions generate most appeals (adolescent autonomy)
    And I examine: what predicts appeal success (constitutional strength, evidence quality)
    And I track: how constitutional interpretation evolves through precedent
    And I discover: whether marginalized communities have equal access to recourse
    And I assess: if appeal process functions as democratic accountability mechanism
    And My analysis reveals: how procedural justice works in practice
    And Findings inform improvements to appeal accessibility and council training
