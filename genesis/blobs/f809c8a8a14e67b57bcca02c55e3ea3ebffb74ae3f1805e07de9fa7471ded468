Scenario: Environmental impacts improve through community-accountable governance
    Given franchise corporate externalized environmental costs for profit maximization
    And community bore environmental impacts (waste, pollution, resource depletion)
    When democratic governance includes environmental stewardship accountability
    Then waste reduction and recycling programs are implemented
    And sustainable sourcing (local, organic, regenerative) is prioritized
    And environmental practices are transparent to community
    And community can hold democratic businesses accountable for environmental impacts
    And community_elohim tracks environmental improvements from democratic governance
