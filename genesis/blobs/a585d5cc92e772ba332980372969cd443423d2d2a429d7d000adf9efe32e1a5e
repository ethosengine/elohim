Scenario: Child earns district reach through exceptional science project
    Given Emma's ecology project demonstrates unusual depth and quality
    And her teacher nominates it for district-wide educational showcase
    When the nomination is evaluated by educational moderators
    Then Emma's project is featured in district educational space
    And other students across the district can learn from her work
    And Emma experiences recognition for quality contribution
    And she connects with other young scientists in the district
    And this exceptional contribution earns her expanded educational reach
