Scenario: Municipal elder care policy informed by caregiver experience
    Given Robert coordinates care for parents ages 78 and 75
    And he's navigated municipal elder care systems
    And he understands what works and what's missing
    When municipal_elohim connects his experience to policy development
    Then it should channel his feedback to municipal elder care planning
    And surface his expertise to municipal aging services
    And help him advocate for caregiver support programs
    And connect him to municipal boards and advisory committees
    And ensure municipal policy reflects actual caregiver needs
    And recognize that users of systems should shape policy
    And build elder care infrastructure based on lived experience
