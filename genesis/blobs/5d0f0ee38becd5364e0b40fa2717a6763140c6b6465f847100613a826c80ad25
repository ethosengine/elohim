Scenario: Industry research and data collection includes care economy metrics
    Given industry research shapes understanding of workforce needs
    And care economy metrics are often missing from industry data
    And better data would support care-friendly policy advocacy
    When industry_elohim advocates for data collection
    Then it should help Robert advocate for industry research on care economy
    And support inclusion of caregiving metrics in workforce studies
    And help industry understand impact of care responsibilities on productivity and retention
    And provide data that supports care-friendly policy business case
    And build industry knowledge base that includes care economy
    And demonstrate that industry advancement requires care economy understanding
    And create evidence base for sector transformation
