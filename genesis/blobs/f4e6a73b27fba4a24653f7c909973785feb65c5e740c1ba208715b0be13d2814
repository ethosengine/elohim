Scenario: Managing sibling conflicts with no co-parent to tag team
    Given children will conflict with each other
    And Maria handles all conflict resolution alone with no one to tag in
    When sibling conflicts arise
    Then the family_elohim should provide conflict resolution guidance
    And it should help Maria address conflicts fairly and age-appropriately
    And it should remind her to stay calm when she's the only adult managing chaos
    And it should prevent her exhaustion from leading to ineffective responses
    And Maria should successfully navigate sibling dynamics without co-parent backup
