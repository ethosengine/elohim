Scenario: Responsible developer navigates approval process transparently
    Given a developer is proposing affordable housing project
    And wants to understand complete approval pathway
    When the Observer provides civic process navigation
    Then the developer sees required steps: zoning review, planning commission, city council
    And receives timeline estimates and submission requirements
    And identifies relevant regulations and precedents
    And connects to appropriate civic contacts
    And navigates process efficiently without buying insider access
    And transparent process reduces corruption opportunities
