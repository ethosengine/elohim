Scenario: Healthcare costs managed through community care economy
    Given Helen faces overwhelming healthcare expenses
    And medical debt threatens her housing stability
    When healthcare costs are tracked
    Then the community_elohim should help navigate cost assistance
    And community care economy should supplement inadequate insurance
    And medical care should not require choosing between health and housing
    And Helen's contributions should create claims on community health resources
    And the protocol should address the healthcare affordability crisis for elderly
    And community networks should provide economic buffer against medical costs
    And care economy should demonstrate healthcare as community responsibility
