Scenario: Moral development supported through care-based choices
    Given Emma is at conventional morality stage (ages 7-11)
    And she is developing sense of right and wrong
    When Emma makes choices that affect others
    Then the personal_agent should highlight moral dimensions
    And the agent should ask "How will this choice affect Tommy?"
    And care ethics should be made explicit in decisions
    And Emma should develop moral reasoning through practice
    And value decisions should be framed as care decisions
    And moral development should be integrated with economic learning
