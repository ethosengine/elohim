Scenario: Personal agent helps prevent expensive mistakes
    Given Aisha bought too much fresh produce last week
    And the produce spoiled before she could use it
    When the personal_agent analyzes her shopping patterns
    Then it should identify the waste pattern
    And it should suggest buying smaller quantities
    And it should recommend frozen alternatives when appropriate
    And the feedback should be constructive, not judgmental
    And Aisha should learn from the mistake without shame
    And the system should help her optimize future purchases
