Scenario: Testing agent behavior in isolated environment
    Given council needs to understand counterfactual scenarios
    And I can run agents in test environments
    When I conduct controlled experiments for council
    Then I test: what agent would decide if input X were different
    And I verify: robustness of constitutional alignment
    And I explore: boundary cases and edge conditions
    And I provide: evidence grounded in testing not speculation
    And I avoid: affecting production systems
    And testing enables: informed judgment about agent behavior
    And council decisions: rest on verified evidence
