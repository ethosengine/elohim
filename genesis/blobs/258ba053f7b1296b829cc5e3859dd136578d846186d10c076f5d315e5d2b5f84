Scenario: Global meta-analysis synthesizing all protocol research
    Given hundreds of researchers have studied protocol worldwide
    And I want to synthesize cumulative knowledge
    When I conduct systematic review and meta-analysis
    Then I identify: all rigorous studies meeting quality criteria
    And I synthesize: findings across diverse contexts and methods
    And I assess: overall evidence about effectiveness and limitations
    And I examine: publication bias and selective reporting
    And I identify: gaps in knowledge requiring further research
    And I provide: comprehensive evidence base for global policy
    And My meta-analysis serves: evidence-based democratic deliberation at planetary scale
