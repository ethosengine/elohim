Scenario: Workplace flexibility negotiated for elder care emergencies
    Given Robert's parents ages 78 and 75 have occasional health emergencies
    And he needs workplace flexibility to respond to care crises
    And his professional position gives him standing to negotiate
    When workplace_elohim supports flexibility negotiation
    Then it should help Robert advocate for flexible work arrangements
    And provide data about productivity maintenance with flexibility
    And support him in negotiating remote work options for care emergencies
    And help him demonstrate that flexibility enables sustainable high performance
    And build workplace policy that accommodates care emergencies
    And prevent him from choosing between professional standing and family care
    And demonstrate that care-friendly workplaces benefit employer and employee
