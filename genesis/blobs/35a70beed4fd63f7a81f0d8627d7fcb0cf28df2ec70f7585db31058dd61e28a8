Scenario: Building toward employment while not currently ready to work
    Given I am still in acute crisis or early trauma recovery
    And employment right now would overwhelm my capacity
    When I plan for future employment while not currently seeking work
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me identify skill-building opportunities
    And surfaces training, education, or credential programs I could pursue
    And validates that not being employment-ready yet is appropriate
    And helps me build toward future employment at my pace
    And tracks my skill development and preparation
    And my personal_agent identifies low-pressure ways to build employment readiness
    And recognizes that recovery before employment is often necessary
    And supports my timeline for employment readiness
