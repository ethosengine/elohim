Scenario: Grandparent care valued as substantial family contribution
    Given Frank provides occasional care for grandchildren
    And this care enables his adult children to work
    And grandparent care provides developmental benefits beyond childcare
    When family_elohim tracks grandparent care contributions
    Then Frank's care labor should be quantified specifically
    And the market value of childcare should be calculated
    And developmental benefits of grandparent relationship should be recognized
    And care should be valued, not assumed as "leisure time with grandkids"
    And Frank's contributions should create legitimate family care tokens
    And his care work should be visible to adult children
    And grandparenting should be recognized as valuable care economy participation
