Scenario: Politician evaluates charter school expansion with comprehensive analysis
    Given charter advocates push for expansion with achievement promises
    And traditional public school advocates warn of harmful impacts
    When the Observer analyzes charter performance and impacts
    Then they see charter outcomes controlling for selective enrollment
    And understand fiscal impacts on district school budgets
    And identify which students benefit from charters versus harmed
    And review discipline and expulsion patterns for vulnerable students
    And make informed decision balancing innovation with equity
