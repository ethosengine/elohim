Scenario: Creator prevented from spreading misinformation
    Given Jordan creates content making unsupported health claims
    And the claims contradict scientific consensus
    When Jordan attempts to contribute the content
    Then the verification agent surfaces counter-evidence
    And Jordan sees the evidence gaps before distribution
    And Jordan can revise with better sources or accept limited reach
    And if posted without revision, reach is limited to personal connections
    And communities are protected from health misinformation
    And Jordan learns that evidence standards enable trust and reach
