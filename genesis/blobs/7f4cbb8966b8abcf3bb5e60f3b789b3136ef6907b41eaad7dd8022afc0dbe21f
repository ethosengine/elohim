Scenario: First-layer appeal review within 24 hours
    Given I appealed my Family Elohim's decision about mental health intervention
    When Community Elohim conducts first-layer appeal review
    Then the review happens within 24 hours of my appeal filing
    And Community Elohim examines if Family Elohim decision was appropriate for local context
    And They consider community resources available (mental health services, support networks)
    And They evaluate if local cultural norms were respected
    And They provide transparent reasoning for their review decision
    And Most appeals are resolved at this layer through clarification or correction
    And I receive immediate notification of the review outcome
