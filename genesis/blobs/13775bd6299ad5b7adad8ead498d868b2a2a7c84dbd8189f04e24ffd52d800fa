Scenario: Food waste reduction as ecological care work
    Given Kenji cannot afford to waste food
    And food waste has significant ecological cost
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food waste reduction
    Then it should recognize Kenji's waste prevention as ecological care
    And it should accumulate care tokens for using all ingredients
    And it should value creative cooking with leftovers
    And it should show "Zero food waste this week = ecological contribution"
    And waste reduction should be recognized as care economy work
    And Kenji's efficient resource use should be valued ecologically
