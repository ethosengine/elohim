Scenario: Study systematic bias correction over time
    Given Year 2 research identified bias affecting marginalized communities
    And protocol modifications were implemented in Year 3
    When James tracks bias indicators through Year 10
    Then he measures whether modifications successfully reduced bias
    And he documents improved outcomes for marginalized communities
    And he identifies remaining persistent inequalities
    And he evaluates effectiveness of bias correction mechanisms
    And longitudinal accountability serves justice
