Scenario: Validating Maria's superhuman efforts without toxic positivity
    Given Maria performs extraordinary care labor daily
    And society often dismisses or pities single parents
    When the personal_agent provides feedback to Maria
    Then it should genuinely recognize her superhuman work
    And it should validate the weight of solo parenting
    And it should avoid toxic positivity that dismisses her struggles
    And it should acknowledge both her strength and her legitimate exhaustion
    And Maria should feel truly seen, not patronized
