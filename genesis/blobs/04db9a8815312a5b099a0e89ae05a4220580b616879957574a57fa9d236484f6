Scenario: Advance directives maintained as authoritative voice
    Given Helen is planning for potential loss of capacity
    And she has specific values about end-of-life care
    When Helen configures her advance directives in the system
    Then her personal_agent should hold and communicate her wishes
    And her values should remain authoritative even if she loses speech
    And medical providers should receive clear advance directive information
    And family should have access to Helen's documented preferences
    And her agency over her own death should be preserved
    And the protocol should ensure her voice guides care when she cannot speak
    And dignity should be maintained throughout end-of-life process
