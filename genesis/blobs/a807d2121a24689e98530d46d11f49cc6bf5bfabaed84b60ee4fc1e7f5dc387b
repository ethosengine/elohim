Scenario: Contributing neighborhood knowledge and resources to care economy network
    Given I am learning valuable information about neighborhood resources
    And other vulnerable people could benefit from my knowledge
    When I discover useful neighborhood information or resources
    Then the Value Scanner enables me to share neighborhood knowledge
    And credits my information contributions to care economy
    And helps other vulnerable people in neighborhood access resources
    And recognizes my neighborhood expertise as valuable contribution
    And validates that I have important knowledge despite being new
    And my personal_agent prompts me to share useful discoveries
    And tracks my information sharing as care economy participation
    And celebrates my contribution to community resource knowledge
