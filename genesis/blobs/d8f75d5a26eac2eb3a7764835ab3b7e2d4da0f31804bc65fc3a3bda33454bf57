Scenario: Politician understands environmental justice patterns in jurisdiction
    Given the politician governs environmental policy at city or state level
    And suspects environmental burdens fall disproportionately
    When the Observer maps environmental conditions and demographics
    Then they see pollution sources concentrated in communities of color
    And identify park access disparities by neighborhood income
    And understand health impact patterns from environmental exposure
    And learn which communities bear cumulative environmental burdens
    And champion environmental justice policies with documented inequities
