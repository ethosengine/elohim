Scenario: Mother's oversight calibrated to preteen's capability
    Given Sarah works two jobs with limited time
    And she needs to trust Marcus while maintaining responsibility
    When Sarah monitors Marcus's scanner usage
    Then she should have full visibility into his activities
    And the family_elohim should alert her when Marcus needs support
    And she should be informed of nutrition concerns or budget crises
    And routine successes should be summarized to build her confidence
    And the system should help her calibrate autonomy levels appropriately
    And she should not experience constant anxiety about delegating responsibility
    And trust should be built through visible competence
