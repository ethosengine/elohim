Scenario: Family shopping as shared care experience
    Given Tommy is shopping with parent Sarah
    And multiple family members have different needs
    When they use the Value Scanner together
    Then Tommy should be learning from Sarah's modeling
    And Sarah should be teaching Tommy value literacy through action
    And the family_elohim should coordinate their different roles
    And Tommy's contributions should be recognized alongside Sarah's
    And shopping should be experienced as family care work, not consumption
    And care economy principles should be transmitted through relationship
