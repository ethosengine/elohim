Scenario: Personal crisis support provides immediate dignified assistance
    Given Sarah encounters a crisis—job loss, health emergency, family breakdown
    And she needs immediate support
    When the personal_agent detects crisis indicators
    Then it should connect her to appropriate resources immediately
    And support should be dignified, not stigmatizing
    And she should access community mutual aid networks
    And crisis response should be effective under extreme stress
    And the protocol should function as safety net during vulnerability
