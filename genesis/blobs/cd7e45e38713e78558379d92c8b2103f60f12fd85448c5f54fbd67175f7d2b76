Scenario: Moderator protects child while educating peer
    Given a teenage member posts content inappropriate for younger children
    And the guardian agent prevents younger children from seeing it
    When Alex is notified of the age-appropriateness issue
    Then Alex reaches out to the teenager with education, not punishment
    And explains how to gauge age-appropriateness
    And the teenager learns and adjusts future contributions
    And younger children were protected without the teenager being shamed
    And restorative education prevented future issues
