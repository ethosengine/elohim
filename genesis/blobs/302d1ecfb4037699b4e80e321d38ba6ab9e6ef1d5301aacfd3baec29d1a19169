Feature: Provincial/State-Level Technical Expertise for Council Advisory
  As a technical_expert in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer
  I want to explain complex AI systems to Constitutional Councils
  So that citizen deliberation is informed without being dominated by expertise

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the technical_expert user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active
    And Dr. Amara Okonkwo provides technical advisory to Regional Constitutional Council

  Scenario: Explaining cryptographic constitutional verification to Sarah's council
    Given Sarah Martinez's Regional Council reviews Marcus's mental health appeal
    And the case involves cryptographic verification questions
    When I provide expert testimony about the technical details
    Then I translate: cryptographic proofs into accessible language
    And I explain: using analogies (locked box showing answer without revealing secret)
    And I clarify: what confidence levels mean and their limitations
    And I acknowledge: where analogies break down and complexity remains
    And I avoid: jargon that excludes or confuses
    And I ensure: Sarah understands enough to judge constitutionality
    And I inform: without dictating the decision

  Scenario: Presenting competing technical interpretations to council
    Given technical experts disagree about transparency method adequacy
    And council needs to understand the disagreement
    When I present both my view and Dr. Chen's alternative
    Then I explain: his argument fairly and completely
    And I articulate: where we agree and where we differ
    And I present: his evidence alongside mine
    And I avoid: dismissing his perspective unfairly
    And I let: council judge which interpretation is more constitutionally aligned
    And I demonstrate: intellectual humility and respect for disagreement
    And council sees: that expertise involves uncertainty

  Scenario: Acknowledging uncertainty in technical analysis
    Given appellant questions agent's 85% confidence in suicide risk pattern
    And council asks if the confidence level is reliable
    When I provide honest uncertainty assessment
    Then I explain: we don't have validated ground truth for this prediction type
    And I acknowledge: the 85% might be overconfident or underconfident
    And I clarify: what we know and what we don't know
    And I avoid: hiding behind expert authority to eliminate uncertainty
    And I enable: council to make decision under acknowledged uncertainty
    And I demonstrate: that honesty about limits builds trust
    And citizens know: when they're governing despite deep uncertainty

  Scenario: Explaining pattern detection without overwhelming council
    Given complex machine learning algorithm detected Marcus's risk pattern
    And council needs to understand how this works
    When I explain pattern recognition in accessible terms
    Then I describe: what data the agent analyzed
    And I clarify: how patterns are detected across multiple factors
    And I explain: what makes this pattern concerning vs normal variation
    And I provide: counterfactuals showing what would change the outcome
    And I avoid: technical details that don't serve constitutional judgment
    And I ensure: council grasps enough to evaluate constitutional alignment
    And I respect: that they don't need to be machine learning experts

  Scenario: Identifying technical error that strengthens appellant's case
    Given I audit agent reasoning for appeal
    And I discover genuine technical mistake (like Wisconsin address confusion)
    When I report the error to Constitutional Council
    Then I explain: clearly what went wrong
    And I assess: impact on the decision
    And I recommend: whether decision should be overturned
    And I serve: truth-telling over defending agents
    And I strengthen: appellant's case when agent erred
    And I demonstrate: that technical oversight is genuine
    And my independence: makes expertise credible

  Scenario: Advising council without dominating their judgment
    Given I have deep knowledge council lacks
    And I could easily dominate deliberation if I pushed too hard
    When I testify about technical implications of constitutional interpretations
    Then I explain: what's technically possible and impossible
    And I clarify: tradeoffs between different approaches
    And I stop: before crossing into values judgment
    And I respect: council's authority to choose among technically viable options
    And I accept: when they choose values over optimization
    And I honor: the boundary between expertise and democratic judgment
    And I demonstrate: how expertise serves rather than replaces democracy

  Scenario: Providing audit access to deep technical details
    Given I need to verify agent decision pathway for appeal
    And I have deeper access than ordinary citizens
    When I examine agent source code, decision logs, and cryptographic proofs
    Then my access is: logged and transparent
    And I can: examine but not modify systems
    And I verify: whether agent followed claimed constitutional principles
    And I check: cryptographic proof validity
    And I identify: any technical vulnerabilities or errors
    And my audit: is itself auditable by other experts
    And deep access: serves genuine oversight not manipulation

  Scenario: Testing agent behavior in isolated environment
    Given council needs to understand counterfactual scenarios
    And I can run agents in test environments
    When I conduct controlled experiments for council
    Then I test: what agent would decide if input X were different
    And I verify: robustness of constitutional alignment
    And I explore: boundary cases and edge conditions
    And I provide: evidence grounded in testing not speculation
    And I avoid: affecting production systems
    And testing enables: informed judgment about agent behavior
    And council decisions: rest on verified evidence

  Scenario: Explaining attack vectors and security risks
    Given appellant claims agent could be manipulated
    And council needs to understand vulnerability
    When I explain potential attack vectors
    Then I describe: how agents could be corrupted or gamed
    And I assess: likelihood and impact of different attacks
    And I explain: defense mechanisms in place
    And I acknowledge: residual risks that remain
    And I avoid: either dismissing concerns or creating panic
    And I provide: realistic risk assessment
    And council can: judge if security is adequate for constitutional governance

  Scenario: Participating in Protocol Research Council review
    Given I serve 6-month rotating term on Protocol Research Council
    And developers propose Agent Protocol v2.3.7 update
    When I evaluate proposed update before deployment
    Then I assess: whether update solves claimed problem
    And I check: for new vulnerabilities introduced
    And I verify: constitutional alignment is maintained
    And I test: adversarial robustness
    And I collaborate: with other experts on review
    And I recommend: approval, rejection, or modification
    And updates require: expert approval before Constitutional Council authorization

  Scenario: Avoiding conflict of interest through transparency
    Given I have relationship with AI company
    And I'm testifying on case involving similar technology
    When I disclose potential conflict before testimony
    Then I reveal: corporate funding, investment, or prior work
    And I explain: how relationship might bias my perspective
    And I offer: to recuse if council finds conflict problematic
    And I maintain: credibility through honesty
    And undisclosed conflicts: would permanently discredit me
    And transparency: keeps expertise trustworthy

  Scenario: Training Constitutional Council members on technical literacy
    Given new council members need technical foundations
    And I contribute to their 3-week training program
    When I teach about AI systems and cryptographic verification
    Then I provide: conceptual understanding without overwhelming detail
    And I enable: critical engagement with technical testimony
    And I avoid: indoctrination about "correct" technical approaches
    And I develop: their capacity to question experts
    And I empower: them to judge despite not being specialists
    And I demonstrate: how ordinary citizens can govern complex technology
