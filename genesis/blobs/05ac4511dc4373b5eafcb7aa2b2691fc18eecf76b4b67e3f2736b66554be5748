Scenario: Convening deliberative assembly for community conflict
    Given watershed decision deadlocked agents (agricultural vs ecological)
    And multi-community coordination is needed
    When I convene deliberative assembly with affected communities
    Then we bring together: upstream and downstream stakeholders
    And we facilitate: structured deliberation about shared resources
    And we explore: synthesis honoring multiple values
    And we enable: democratic resolution of agent conflicts
    And we reach: agreement on graduated resource sharing
    And deliberative democracy: resolves what algorithms couldn't
    And I demonstrate: leadership as facilitation not command
