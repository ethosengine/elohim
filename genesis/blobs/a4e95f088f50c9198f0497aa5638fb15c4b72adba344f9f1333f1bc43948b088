    Given children need connection to living world
    And Sarah takes Tommy and Emma to parks, forests, waterways
    When the ecological_elohim tracks nature-based education
    Then it should recognize outdoor time as valuable educational labor
    And it should value Sarah's work facilitating nature connection
    And teaching through direct ecological experience should accumulate tokens
    And the system should recognize that nature connection is parenting work
    And environmental education should be valued alongside academic learning
    And Sarah's effort to build children's nature relationship should be recognized
