Scenario: Maintaining children's nutrition on catastrophically limited food budget
    Given I have approximately $X per week for groceries
    And I need to provide nutritious meals for growing children
    When I plan household meals and shopping
    Then the Value Scanner helps me maximize nutrition within extreme constraints
    And surfaces local food assistance programs and resources
    And provides meal planning that works with my cooking capacity and time
    And helps me navigate food pantries and assistance with dignity
    And tracks children's nutritional needs and preferences
    And my personal_agent suggests creative solutions for healthy eating on no money
    And recognizes my food provision as sophisticated care economy work
    And validates that feeding children well under these constraints is remarkable achievement
