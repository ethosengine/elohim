Scenario: Activist exposes systematic school resource inequities
    Given the activist campaigns for education equity
    And suspects systematic under-resourcing of schools serving students of color
    When the Observer analyzes district resource distribution
    Then the activist sees experienced teachers concentrate in white affluent schools
    And gifted programs and AP courses cluster in privileged areas
    And facility quality and maintenance vary by neighborhood
    And per-student spending disparities reach thousands of dollars
    And segregation pattern becomes legally actionable
