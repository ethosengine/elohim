Scenario: Coordinating family decision-making about major changes
    Given major decisions affect my children and our whole family
    And I want children to have age-appropriate voice while I retain authority
    When we face decisions about housing, location, schooling, or other major changes
    Then the family_elohim facilitates age-appropriate family discussions
    And helps children express their needs and preferences
    And supports me in making final decisions considering everyone's input
    And tracks family decision-making process
    And validates children's participation without parentifying them
    And my personal_agent ensures all voices are heard appropriately
    And recognizes inclusive decision-making as sophisticated parenting
    And celebrates family decisions made together
