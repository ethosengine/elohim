Scenario: Municipal food security programs integrate with care economy
    Given municipal food assistance programs exist
    And many residents participate in care economy food cooperatives
    When municipal food security is addressed
    Then the municipal_elohim should coordinate with existing programs
    And care economy food cooperatives should receive municipal support
    And care tokens should integrate with food assistance
    And municipal food policy should recognize cooperative models
    And care economy should enhance, not replace, public food security
