Scenario: Community care economy includes diverse cultural approaches
    Given Sarah's community includes diverse cultural backgrounds
    And different cultures have different care economy traditions
    When community care economy operates
    Then the community_elohim should respect cultural diversity
    And it should accommodate different care practices
    And it should not impose single cultural framework
    And diverse approaches should be honored and integrated
    And community care economy should be culturally adaptive
