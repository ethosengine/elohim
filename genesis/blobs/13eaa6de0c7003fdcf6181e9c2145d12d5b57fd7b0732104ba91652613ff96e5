Scenario: Alternative education models aligned with care economy
    Given traditional higher education often fails care economy principles
    And alternative models exist (cooperative education, free universities, community learning)
    When Kenji explores educational alternatives
    Then the educational_elohim should inform him of care-aligned options
    And it should help him evaluate educational models against care principles
    And it should recognize diverse pathways for learning and development
    And the system should support student exploration of alternative education
    And education should serve flourishing, not just credential accumulation
    And care economy education should be accessible and diverse
