Scenario: State legislator understands local impacts of statewide policy
    Given the politician represents specific legislative district
    And considers statewide legislation
    When the Observer analyzes district-specific impacts
    Then they see how legislation affects their constituents specifically
    And identify trade-offs between district and statewide interests
    And understand which constituent communities benefit versus harmed
    And explain vote to constituents with local impact data
    And balance representation of district versus state interests
