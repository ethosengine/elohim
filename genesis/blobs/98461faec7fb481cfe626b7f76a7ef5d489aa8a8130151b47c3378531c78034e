Scenario: Learning from mistakes without shame or judgment
    Given Aisha will make errors as she learns
    And learning requires safe failure
    When Aisha makes suboptimal decisions
    Then the personal_agent should provide constructive feedback
    And it should explain what happened and why
    And it should suggest better approaches for future
    And feedback should be educational, never judgmental
    And mistakes should be treated as learning opportunities
    And the system should create psychologically safe learning environment
