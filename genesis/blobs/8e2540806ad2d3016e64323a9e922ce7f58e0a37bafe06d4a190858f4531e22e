Scenario: Family care tokens reflect Maria's role as sole active parent
    Given Maria provides all active parenting for three children
    And she's performing care work of two parents alone
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Maria's tokens should reflect solo parenting of multiple children
    And the protocol should recognize she's providing all emotional support, guidance, and presence
    And her care contributions should be valued higher than partnered parents
    And quantified solo parenting work should validate her superhuman efforts
    And society should see undeniable proof that single parents deserve extraordinary support
