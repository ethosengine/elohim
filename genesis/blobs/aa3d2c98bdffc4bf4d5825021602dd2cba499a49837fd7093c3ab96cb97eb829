Scenario: Workers provide mutual aid across businesses during crisis
    Given ChickenMax experiences unexpected staffing shortage
    And Garden Bowl Express has capacity to help
    When ChickenMax requests temporary worker support
    Then industry_sector_elohim coordinates cross-entity worker loan
    And Garden Bowl workers volunteer to help ChickenMax for two weeks
    And compensation is shared fairly between entities
    And Maria trains Garden Bowl workers on ChickenMax operations
    And sector solidarity prevents individual business failures
