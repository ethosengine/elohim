Scenario: Medication management supported across multiple providers
    Given David takes multiple medications from different specialists
    And medication interactions could be dangerous
    When the healthcare_elohim tracks David's medications
    Then it should maintain comprehensive medication list
    And it should identify potential interactions across providers
    And it should alert James to medication concerns
    And medication timing and administration should be tracked
    And medical complexity should be managed systematically
