    Given commission faces pressure to approve suburban expansion development
    And developers argue expansion provides affordable housing opportunities
    And environmentalists advocate for urban infill to reduce sprawl
    When the commissioner requests Observer growth pattern analysis
    Then they receive comparison of infrastructure costs for sprawl versus infill
    And see environmental impacts analysis including habitat, emissions, and water use
    And access true affordability analysis accounting for transportation costs
    And understand fiscal impacts on municipality over time
    And accessible expertise helps commissioner evaluate complex growth trade-offs
