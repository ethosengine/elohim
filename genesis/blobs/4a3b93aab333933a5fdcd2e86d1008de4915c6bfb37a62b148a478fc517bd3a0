Scenario: Explaining cryptographic constitutional proof to global assembly
    Given delegates need to understand how constitutional verification works
    And many come from contexts without technical infrastructure
    When I explain cryptographic alignment proof accessibly
    Then I use: universal analogies and visual demonstrations
    And I ensure: translation into dozens of languages
    And I check: comprehension across educational backgrounds
    And I avoid: assuming Western technical education
    And I honor: diverse ways of understanding verification
    And I enable: informed global deliberation despite technical complexity
    And I demonstrate: that anyone can understand enough to govern
