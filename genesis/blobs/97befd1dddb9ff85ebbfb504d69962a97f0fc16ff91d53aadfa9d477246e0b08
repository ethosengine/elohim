Scenario: Organizer tracks implementation of restorative justice commitment
    Given district adopted restorative justice to reduce suspensions
    And the organizer's coalition of parents and students won the policy
    When the Observer tracks implementation progress
    Then the organizer monitors training of school staff
    And sees suspension data by school, race, and disability status
    And identifies schools not implementing restorative practices
    And documents where implementation succeeds and changes outcomes
    And policy victory leads to implementation accountability
