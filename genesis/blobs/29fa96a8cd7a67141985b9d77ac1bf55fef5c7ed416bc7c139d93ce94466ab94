Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained throughout system
    Given Margaret participates in the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Margaret chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then her choice must be honored immediately
    And all data retention must follow minimal legal requirements
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
    And Margaret's right to not participate must be absolute
    And her autonomy over technology use must be respected
    And disconnection should be simple and complete
