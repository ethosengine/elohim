Scenario: Disability culture and identity respected and affirmed
    Given Alex's disability is part of their identity
    And disabled people have distinct culture and community
    When the Value Scanner represents disability
    Then it should use identity-first or person-first language per Alex's preference
    And it should present disability as difference, not deficit
    And it should connect Alex to disability community resources
    And disability culture should be recognized as valuable
    And Alex should see positive representation of disability
    And the protocol should embody social model, not medical model
    And Alex's disabled identity should be affirmed, not erased
