Scenario: Making the invisible mental load visible to self
    Given Sarah manages complex care coordination across multiple people
    And she tracks schedules, preferences, allergies, developmental needs, and household inventory
    When the personal_agent monitors Sarah's cognitive labor
    Then it should quantify the mental load she carries
    And it should make visible the dozens of decisions she makes hourly
    And it should show "Today you managed 127 care-related decisions"
    And Sarah should see that her mental labor is real work
    And the invisible should become undeniably visible
    And her cognitive labor should be valued as professional-grade skill
