Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained despite vulnerability
    Given Helen is elderly and vulnerable
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Helen or her designated advocate chooses to disconnect
    Then the system must honor disconnection immediately
    And no manipulative retention patterns should be employed
    And her right to refuse participation must be absolute
    And vulnerability does not diminish constitutional rights
    And data deletion must occur per her instructions
    And autonomy includes the right to reject the protocol entirely
