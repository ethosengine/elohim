Scenario: Pedagogical approach adapts to individual learning pace
    Given Emma's development may vary from age averages
    And learning readiness differs across children
    When the personal_agent teaches value concepts
    Then instruction should adapt to Emma's actual capabilities
    And pacing should match her individual readiness
    And the system should observe comprehension signals
    And no child should be pushed beyond capacity
    And no child should be held back from what they're ready to learn
    And personalized learning should respect individual development
