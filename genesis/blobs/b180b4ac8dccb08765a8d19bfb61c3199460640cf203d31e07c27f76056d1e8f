Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Teen
  As a teen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to participate as a junior partner moving toward equality in family governance
  So that my substantial care contributions are recognized and I learn how families function as economic units

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teen user "Jasmine" is registered in the system
    And Jasmine is 16 years old
    And she is part of a family unit with parent Maya and sibling Jordan (age 12)
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim is coordinating family care economy
    And Jasmine's personal_agent communicates with family_elohim

  Scenario: Teen's substantial care work made visible to family
    Given Jasmine manages weekly grocery shopping for the family
    And she coordinates dinner preparation 3 nights per week
    And she provides childcare for Jordan after school
    When the family_elohim processes her contributions
    Then Jasmine's care work should be visible on the family dashboard
    And her contributions should be quantified and valued
    And parent Maya should see specific recognition prompts
    And family care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions
    And the visibility should prevent the invisibility that often surrounds teen household labor
    And Jasmine should experience being valued as a genuine contributor

  Scenario: Teen participates in family governance decisions with real voice
    Given the family is making decisions about a major purchase (new appliance)
    And Jasmine has accumulated significant care contributions
    And she has relevant knowledge and preferences
    When the family_elohim facilitates the decision process
    Then Jasmine's voice should carry weight in the decision
    And her input should be solicited and genuinely considered
    And she should participate as a junior partner, not just be consulted
    And the family should make decisions that reflect all members' input
    And Jasmine should learn that her participation in family governance is legitimate
    And the decision process should prepare her for adult household management

  Scenario: Teen manages portions of household budget with real responsibility
    Given Jasmine has been allocated responsibility for weekly food budget
    And the family has allocated $100/week for her to manage
    And this is part of the actual household budget, not pretend
    When Jasmine makes purchasing decisions
    Then she should have genuine authority over those funds
    And her decisions should have real impact on family wellbeing
    And the family_elohim should track her budget management
    And provide feedback on value optimization
    And recognize successful management: "Jasmine has stayed within budget and met family needs for 12 consecutive weeks"
    And support her learning household economics through real practice

  Scenario: Relationship with parent shifts toward adult partnership
    Given Jasmine has demonstrated substantial capability
    And she contributes meaningfully to household functioning
    When parent Maya interacts with Jasmine through the care economy
    Then the family_elohim should reflect their evolving relationship
    And Maya should receive prompts that honor Jasmine's growing autonomy
    And support Maya in trusting Jasmine's judgment
    And recognize when Jasmine needs support versus when she's capable
    And facilitate the gradual transition from parent-child to adult-adult relationship
    And help Maya learn to be available for support without controlling

  Scenario: Teen coordinates her schedule with family needs
    Given Jasmine works part-time with variable hours
    And the family has commitments that require coordination
    And Jordan needs after-school supervision
    When Jasmine's work schedule is set
    Then her personal_agent should communicate with family_elohim
    And flag potential conflicts: "Jordan needs supervision Tuesday 3-6pm"
    And help Jasmine balance her work commitments with family responsibilities
    And recognize her care contributions when she adjusts her schedule for family
    And support the family in coordinating across multiple schedules
    And demonstrate that family functioning requires mutual care and flexibility

  Scenario: Family care tokens acknowledge teen's economic contribution
    Given the family participates in care token economy
    And Jasmine contributes substantial household labor, childcare, and coordination
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Jasmine's contributions should be valued appropriately
    And her care work should be recognized as genuine economic contribution
    And tokens should accumulate to her individual account within the family system
    And she should have voice in how family care tokens are used
    And her standing in family economic decisions should reflect her contribution
    And the token system should make visible what traditional economics renders invisible

  Scenario: Teen provides sibling care as valued family contribution
    Given Jasmine provides regular after-school care for Jordan
    And this care enables parent Maya to work full-time
    And Jasmine's care work has substantial economic value
    When Jasmine's sibling care is tracked
    Then it should be valued as the labor it is, not dismissed as "just babysitting"
    And the care should be recognized in family care token allocation
    And Maya should receive prompts to explicitly acknowledge this contribution
    And Jordan should learn to recognize Jasmine's care work
    And the family should understand that Jasmine's care enables their current lifestyle
    And if external childcare would cost $15/hour, Jasmine's care should be valued accordingly

  Scenario: Teen participates in family financial planning
    Given the family is planning for the coming year
    And Jasmine has savings goals for college
    And she contributes to household income through her part-time work
    When the family_elohim facilitates financial planning
    Then Jasmine should be included in the planning process
    And her goals should be incorporated into family financial strategy
    And she should learn how families make long-term financial decisions
    And her contributions (both household labor and income) should be factored into planning
    And she should practice the financial planning skills she'll need as an adult
    And the family should model transparent, participatory financial governance

  Scenario: Privacy boundaries negotiated as teen develops autonomy
    Given Jasmine has legitimate need for privacy from family
    And the family has legitimate need for coordination and safety
    When Jasmine configures privacy settings
    Then she should control what family data is shared about her
    And family-relevant information (schedule, household responsibilities) should be accessible to family_elohim
    And her personal information (friendships, private purchases, reflections) should be protected
    And privacy boundaries should be negotiable as she demonstrates capability
    And the system should support healthy family relationships that respect growing autonomy
    And Maya should not experience anxiety about granting Jasmine appropriate privacy

  Scenario: Teen's care contributions prevent exploitation within family
    Given Jasmine contributes substantial household labor
    And there is risk of teen labor being exploited even within families
    When Jasmine's care contributions exceed healthy boundaries
    Then the family_elohim should flag potential exploitation
    And surface if Jasmine's responsibilities are preventing her development
    And recognize if she's providing excessive childcare or household labor
    And prompt family discussion about fair distribution of care work
    And protect Jasmine from being trapped in unpaid household labor
    And ensure her contributions are recognized and not taken for granted

  Scenario: Teen learns family economic realities through transparency
    Given Jasmine is preparing for adult independence
    And understanding family economics is essential preparation
    When the family_elohim provides family economic information
    Then Jasmine should have age-appropriate access to family financial realities
    And understand household income, expenses, and budget constraints
    And learn how the family makes financial tradeoffs
    And develop realistic expectations about adult economic life
    And understand the economic value of household labor
    And learn that all families engage in care economy, whether they use that language or not

  Scenario: Multigenerational family care patterns include teen as contributor
    Given Jasmine's grandmother requires increasing care support
    And the family is coordinating care across generations
    When Jasmine contributes to grandmother's care
    Then her care work should be tracked and valued
    And the family_elohim should coordinate care across three generations
    And Jasmine should learn that care flows in multiple directions
    And her care for grandmother should build toward her understanding of lifecycle care
    And the family should model care economy across the full lifespan
    And Jasmine's generation should learn that elder care is shared family responsibility
