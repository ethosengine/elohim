Scenario: Owner transitions identity from sole owner to community elder
    Given Rosa's identity was tied to business ownership
    And exit could mean loss of meaning and social isolation
    When EAE offers transition support
    Then Rosa receives counseling for identity transition
    And Rosa explores new roles: advisor, retiree, community elder
    And Rosa's expertise is valued through consulting compensation
    And transition is honored as life stage, not failure
    And Rosa discovers purpose beyond ownership burden
