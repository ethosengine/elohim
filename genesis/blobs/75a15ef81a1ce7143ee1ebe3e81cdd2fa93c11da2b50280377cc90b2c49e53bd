Scenario: Negotiating employment flexibility for childcare and recovery needs
    Given I need employment flexibility for childcare, therapy, legal appointments, and crisis management
    And employers may resist flexibility or see it as liability
    When I negotiate employment terms
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me request appropriate accommodations
    And provides language for negotiating flexibility professionally
    And helps me understand my legal rights to reasonable accommodation
    And validates that my needs are reasonable and should be accommodated
    And identifies employers more likely to provide needed flexibility
    And my personal_agent coaches me through negotiation conversations
    And recognizes that advocating for my needs is professional strength
    And supports me in finding employment compatible with my life
