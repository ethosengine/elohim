Scenario: Child's care work saves family money with real impact
    Given the family has tight budget constraints
    And Emma chooses cost-effective options consistently
    When Emma's choices accumulate over time
    Then actual savings should be calculated and visible
    And Emma should see concrete impact: "Your choices saved $47 this month"
    And the family should be able to allocate savings to other needs
    And Emma's stewardship should have measurable benefit
    And economic contribution should be recognized as genuine help
    And she should understand her agency affects family flourishing
