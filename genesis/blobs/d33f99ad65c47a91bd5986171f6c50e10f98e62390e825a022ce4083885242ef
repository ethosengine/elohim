Scenario: No mandatory overtime that conflicts with solo parenting obligations
    Given Maria must be available for her children's pickup, dinner, homework, bedtime
    And she has no partner to cover evening parenting when she works late
    When workplace demands overtime or schedule extensions
    Then the workplace_elohim should flag conflicts with parenting obligations
    And Maria should be able to refuse overtime without retaliation
    And employers should understand single parents have non-negotiable care obligations
    And work demands should not force choice between job and children's basic needs
    And Maria should maintain employment boundaries necessary for parenting
