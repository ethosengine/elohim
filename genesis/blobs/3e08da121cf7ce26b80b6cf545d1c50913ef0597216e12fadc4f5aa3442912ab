Scenario: Care token accumulation for self-care and household contributions
    Given Kenji prepares nutritious meals for himself
    And he manages his space, does laundry, and maintains basic self-care
    When the Value Scanner tracks Kenji's individual care contributions
    Then it should accumulate care tokens for self-care labor
    And it should recognize that caring for himself is care economy work
    And it should track his development of adult life skills
    And self-maintenance should be valued, not invisible
    And the system should make visible the work of sustaining himself
    And Kenji should see that taking care of himself is productive
