# Young Child - Value Scanner

## Archetype

Tommy is 5 years old. He stands in the produce aisle holding his family's shopping scanner, eyes wide with wonder at the rows of strawberries. His personal_agent knows he's selecting fruit for his sister Emma's breakfast, and gently guides him: "Remember, Emma loves the red ones." Tommy's care contribution—choosing strawberries for his sister—will be recorded not for surveillance, but so his parents can later say, "Thank you for taking care of Emma today." At this developmental stage, Tommy operates almost entirely within the individual and family governance layers, with parental oversight supreme.

Tommy represents the Pure Discovery phase (ages 5-7) of the Value Scanner epic. He's learning that his choices matter, that caring for others creates value, and that he has agency within safe boundaries. His household income is $40k/year—his family qualifies for care token supplements that make the shopping scanner accessible regardless of economic status. The protocol isn't teaching Tommy to be a consumer; it's teaching him to be a contributor to his family's flourishing.

What makes Tommy distinct in this epic is not just his age, but his developmental need for wonder preservation. The Value Scanner must work differently for him than for his 8-year-old peers—no gamification, no points systems that train extraction thinking. Instead, pure recognition: "You helped. Your care matters. You made Emma happy." This is where care economy transformation begins—in a 5-year-old learning that invisible work (choosing strawberries) is actually visible, valuable, and worthy of recognition.

## Core Needs

- **Wonder Preservation**: Tommy needs the shopping experience to remain magical, not transactional. The Value Scanner must present choices as adventures in care ("What will make Emma smile?") rather than economic decisions. His personal_agent serves by protecting his natural generosity from being corrupted into calculation. The care economy becomes visible to him through story and relationship, not metrics. When he sees his contribution recorded, it should feel like recognition from someone who loves him, not data extraction.

- **Safe Exploration Within Boundaries**: Tommy needs real autonomy (actual choice-making) within invisible guardrails. His parent's family_elohim has set boundaries—nut-free because of Emma's allergies, budget-aware, nutritionally appropriate—but Tommy experiences these as natural limits, not restrictions. He's learning what's possible within his family's care ecosystem. The protocol makes these boundaries feel like safety, not surveillance. His agency is genuine but age-appropriate.

- **Recognition for Care Contributions**: Tommy needs his care work to be seen and valued. Traditional economics don't recognize that a 5-year-old choosing strawberries for his sister is performing care labor. The Value Scanner makes this visible: his family receives care tokens reflecting his contribution, and his parents receive prompts to acknowledge his specific help. This isn't participation trophy culture—it's making real care work visible. Tommy experiences being a valued contributor to his family's flourishing, building identity around care rather than consumption.

- **Developmental Appropriate Learning**: Tommy needs to learn value literacy at his developmental stage. The scanner teaches through concrete experiences: "Strawberries for Emma" not "unit economics" or "opportunity cost." He's building neural pathways around care-based decision making before abstract economic thinking develops. His personal_agent translates complex care economy principles into 5-year-old-appropriate interactions. He's learning that his choices have meaning and consequence without being overwhelmed by complexity.

## Key Relationships

**To Parents**: Tommy's relationship with his parent (Sarah) is mediated by the family_elohim which ensures his scanner permissions align with family values and his developmental stage. Sarah sets the boundaries; Tommy experiences autonomy within them. The protocol enables Sarah to grant him real agency without anxiety, knowing the invisible guardrails protect both Tommy's safety and the family's needs. When Tommy makes care contributions, Sarah receives specific prompts ("Tommy chose strawberries for Emma") that help her recognize work that would otherwise be invisible.

**To Siblings**: Tommy's care contributions often target his sister Emma (age 7). The Value Scanner helps him understand her needs (allergies, preferences) and makes his care for her visible to the family. His personal_agent might suggest, "Emma loved the strawberries you picked last time" creating positive feedback loops around care. The protocol is building sibling relationships based on mutual care rather than competition.

**To Personal Agent**: Tommy's relationship with his personal_agent is his first experience of AI as servant, not master. The agent witnesses his care work, celebrates his contributions, and gently guides his learning. It never manipulates, never extracts data for profit, never trains him toward consumption. It exists only to help Tommy flourish and to make his care visible. This sets his baseline expectations for what technology should do: serve human dignity.

**To Community**: Tommy doesn't directly interface with community_elohim, but his anonymized care patterns contribute to neighborhood-level insights about how families with young children shop and care. The protocol protects his privacy absolutely while allowing his family's care patterns to help others. He's part of a care economy he can't yet conceptualize, but benefits from (store hours that work for families, product availability based on community needs).

## Relevant Governance Layers

### Geographic/Political

**Individual Layer**
Tommy operates at maximum autonomy appropriate to his development. His personal_agent helps him make choices, but he experiences genuine agency. His preferences, his care decisions, his learning pace—all honored as expressions of his individual dignity. The protocol recognizes him as a person bearing the divine image, not a future adult to be programmed. His values are forming; the system serves that formation toward care and flourishing.

**Family Layer**
This is Tommy's primary governance context. Family values (set by parents) shape his boundaries, permissions, and learning experiences. The family_elohim ensures his scanner choices align with household needs (budget, nutrition, allergies) while preserving his agency. Family care tokens recognize his contributions. Family patterns (shopping together, recognizing each other's care) are the primary interface where Tommy experiences the care economy.

### Functional

**Educational Layer**
Tommy is learning value literacy through direct experience. The Value Scanner is his teacher, but operating under pedagogical principles appropriate to ages 5-7: concrete experiences, relationship-based learning, wonder preservation. Educational policies about early childhood development inform how his personal_agent interacts with him. He's building foundational understanding that care creates value, that his choices matter, and that economic systems can serve human flourishing.

## Implementation Notes

- **Technical**: Interface must be extremely simple—large icons, voice guidance, minimal text. Scanner should work with gross motor skills (5-year-olds have developing fine motor control). Response time must be immediate (attention span considerations). Personal_agent voice should be warm, encouraging, never transactional. All data encrypted, with family layer controls on what's recorded.

- **Privacy**: Absolute protection of Tommy's data. No advertising, no third-party access, no behavioral profiling for commercial purposes. His care contributions recorded only within family context. Anonymization before any community-level aggregation. Parents have full visibility and control over what's tracked. Tommy's wonder must never be monetized.

- **Interface**: Design for pre-readers or early readers. Visual feedback primary (happy animations when care is recognized). Audio guidance available but optional. Haptic feedback (gentle vibrations) for boundaries. Color-coded for safety (green = good choice, yellow = ask parent, red = allergen/danger). No addictive design patterns—this isn't a game, it's a learning tool.

- **Constraints**: Parental oversight required at this age. Tommy shouldn't use scanner without parent present or explicit permission. Boundaries must be invisible but absolute (he can't accidentally select allergens or exceed budget). Learning pace varies wildly at this age—system must adapt to individual development, not age-based averages.

- **Opportunities**: This is where care economy transformation begins—in the neural pathways forming in a 5-year-old's brain. If Tommy learns that care creates value, that his agency serves others' flourishing, that technology witnesses and honors his dignity—he'll expect those things from all systems. He's learning an alternative to surveillance capitalism before he even knows what capitalism is. His generation could grow up assuming care economy principles are normal.
