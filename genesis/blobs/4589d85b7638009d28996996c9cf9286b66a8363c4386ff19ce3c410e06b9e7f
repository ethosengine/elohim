Scenario: Climate crisis disproportionately harms disabled people
    Given disabled people are especially vulnerable to climate impacts
    And emergency systems often fail disabled people
    When climate adaptation is planned
    Then the bioregional_elohim should center disabled people in climate planning
    And Alex's perspective should inform climate justice strategies
    And emergency preparedness should account for disability needs
    And climate solutions should be accessible to disabled people
    And the protocol should recognize disability as environmental justice issue
    And Alex's expertise about vulnerability should guide climate work
    And resilience planning should protect most vulnerable community members
