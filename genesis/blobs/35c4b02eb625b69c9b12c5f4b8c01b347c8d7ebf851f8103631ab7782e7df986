Scenario: Witnessing food waste and understanding ecological cost
    Given I see significant food waste in restaurant operations
    And food waste represents wasted care labor and ecological resources
    When I observe food system inefficiencies
    Then the protocol should help me understand ecological and care economy costs
    And support me in advocating for waste reduction
    And connect me to food rescue or composting initiatives
    And recognize that reducing waste is care work for ecology
