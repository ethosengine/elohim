Scenario: Housing and energy use optimized for sustainability
    Given Robert's household uses energy for heating, cooling, and power
    And housing energy use significantly affects ecological impact
    And household improvements can reduce ecological footprint
    When bioregional_elohim supports energy optimization
    Then it should analyze household energy consumption patterns
    And suggest improvements: insulation, renewable energy, efficiency upgrades
    And connect energy reduction to cost savings that support care economy participation
    And help Robert prioritize improvements within household budget
    And recognize that sustainable housing serves current and future generations
    And demonstrate that ecological stewardship is long-term care
    And build household infrastructure that reduces bioregional impact
