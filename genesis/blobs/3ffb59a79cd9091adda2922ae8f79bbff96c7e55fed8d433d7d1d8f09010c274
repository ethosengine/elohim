Scenario: Connecting with community mutual aid networks
    Given workers need mutual aid during economic precarity
    And community has mutual aid organizing
    When I participate in mutual aid networks
    Then the protocol should connect me to appropriate networks
    And facilitate giving and receiving support
    And recognize that mutual aid is care economy practice
    And support building community resilience beyond market systems
