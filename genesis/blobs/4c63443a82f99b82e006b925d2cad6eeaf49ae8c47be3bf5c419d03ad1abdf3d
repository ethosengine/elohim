Scenario: Customer loyalty deepens through values alignment and relationship
    Given corporate loyalty was transactional (rewards programs) or habitual (convenience)
    And Ms. Johnson's loyalty to ChickenMax was weak and circumstantial
    When democratic ownership creates genuine basis for loyalty
    Then loyalty comes from values alignment (supporting worker ownership)
    And relationships with workers create emotional connection
    And community commitment makes leaving feel like betraying neighbors
    And loyalty is authentic, not manufactured through manipulation
    And community_elohim tracks loyalty through retention, not surveillance rewards programs
