Scenario: Global data infrastructure with privacy and sovereignty protection
    Given I need access to data across nations for research
    And I must respect privacy, sovereignty, and data justice
    When global research infrastructure is designed
    Then I work with: federated data systems respecting national sovereignty
    And I use: differential privacy protecting individual anonymity
    And I ensure: community data ownership and benefit sharing
    And I implement: ethical review and consent protocols
    And I advocate: for open access to research findings
    And I practice: data justice not data colonialism
    And My methodology demonstrates: how to study globally while respecting locally
