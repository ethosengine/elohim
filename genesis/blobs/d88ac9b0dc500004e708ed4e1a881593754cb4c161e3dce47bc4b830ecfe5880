Scenario: Making Sarah's care contributions visible to extended family
    Given Sarah performs enormous care labor across family contexts
    And extended family may not see the full scope
    When family care contributions are tracked
    Then Sarah's care for children should be quantified
    And her care for aging parents should be visible
    And her household coordination should be recognized
    And extended family should see Sarah's contributions specifically
    And visibility should enable fair family labor distribution
