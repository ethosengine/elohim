Scenario: Adopting Elohim Protocol through community referendum
    Given Riverside is considering protocol adoption
    And I am responsible for democratic decision-making process
    When we conduct community deliberation and vote
    Then we provide: 6 months of education and pilot testing
    And we ensure: residents understand what they're choosing
    And we hold: town halls, demonstrations, Q&A sessions
    And we offer: transparent information about benefits and risks
    And we conduct: referendum with 65% approval threshold
    And we respect: community sovereignty to accept or reject
    And adoption becomes: democratic mandate not top-down imposition
    And I am accountable: for implementation serving community values
