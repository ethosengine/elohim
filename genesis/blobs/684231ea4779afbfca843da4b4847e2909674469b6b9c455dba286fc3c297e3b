Scenario: End-of-life ecological considerations in care planning
    Given Helen is planning for end of life
    And death has ecological dimensions
    When Helen makes end-of-life care decisions
    Then ecological options should be presented as available choices
    And natural burial or green funeral options should be surfaced
    And her values about environmental impact should extend through death
    And the protocol should support ecological considerations in dying
    And bioregional care economy should include sustainable death practices
    And Helen's environmental values should guide her death as they guided her life
    And end of life should be opportunity to minimize environmental harm
