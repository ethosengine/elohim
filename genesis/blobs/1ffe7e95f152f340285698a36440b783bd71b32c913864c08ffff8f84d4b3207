Scenario: Schools challenge single-parent deficit narratives through care economy data
    Given society often views single-parent families as inherently problematic
    And this stigma affects how teachers and administrators view Maria's children
    When schools engage with single-parent families
    Then the educational_elohim should provide care economy data showing single parents' contributions
    And schools should recognize single parents as providing extraordinary care
    And deficit narratives about single-parent families should be challenged with evidence
    And Maria and her children should be treated with respect, not pity
    And educational systems should support single-parent family thriving, not assume deficiency
