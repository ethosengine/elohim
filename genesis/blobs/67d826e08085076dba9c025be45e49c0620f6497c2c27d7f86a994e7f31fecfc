Scenario: Municipal parks and recreation optimized for senior use
    Given Margaret needs physical activity for health
    And public spaces should serve all ages
    When the municipality_elohim provides recreation information
    Then parks should have senior-appropriate amenities
    And walking paths, benches, and accessibility should be prioritized
    And recreation programs should include senior activities
    And public space should support active aging
    And municipal planning should consider senior needs
    And Margaret should have access to health-supporting public resources
