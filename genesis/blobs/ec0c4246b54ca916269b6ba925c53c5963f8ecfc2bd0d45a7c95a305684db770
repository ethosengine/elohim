Scenario: Manager's facilitation effectiveness is democratically evaluated
    Given workers want accountability for coordinator role
    And corporate model had no worker input on manager performance
    When quarterly facilitation review occurs
    Then workers provide feedback on Marcus's coordination effectiveness
    And workers rate his facilitation skills, transparency, and respect for autonomy
    And feedback informs Marcus's continued development
    And poor evaluations trigger support and training, not immediate termination
    And sustained poor performance enables democratic recall
    And workplace_elohim ensures fair evaluation process
