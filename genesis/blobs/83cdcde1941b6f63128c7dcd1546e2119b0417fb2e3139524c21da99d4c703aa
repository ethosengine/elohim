Scenario: Dissenting opinion preserved in regional precedent
    Given Regional Constitutional Council deliberates my appeal
    And the council reaches majority decision but some members disagree
    When the precedent is documented
    Then dissenting opinions are included with their reasoning
    And The dissent explains alternative constitutional interpretation
    And Future councils can reference both majority and dissent
    And Constitutional evolution can draw on minority wisdom later
    And My appeal generates rich constitutional dialogue not just single answer
    And Disagreement is honored as part of democratic deliberation
