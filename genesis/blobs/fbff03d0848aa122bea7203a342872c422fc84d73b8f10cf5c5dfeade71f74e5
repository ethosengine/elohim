Scenario: Mathematical skills developed through budget management
    Given Marcus manages $75 weekly budget across multiple constraints
    And budgeting requires sophisticated mathematical thinking
    When Marcus allocates resources across needs
    Then he should be learning applied mathematics
    And he should practice percentage calculations, unit pricing, budgeting
    And math should be learned through authentic application
    And his mathematical capabilities should exceed typical age-level expectations
    And the personal_agent should reinforce mathematical concepts
    And care economy should provide rich mathematical learning environment
