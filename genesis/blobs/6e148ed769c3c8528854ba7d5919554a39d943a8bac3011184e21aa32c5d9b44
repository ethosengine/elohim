Scenario: Municipal Elohim provides cross-neighborhood insights
    Given different neighborhoods have distinct challenges
    And patterns aren't visible at single-neighborhood scale
    When Municipal Elohim synthesizes cross-neighborhood data
    Then I see: resource flows between neighborhoods
    And I identify: opportunities for coordination
    And I notice: problems emerging in multiple areas
    And I recognize: how neighborhoods affect each other
    And I use: this information for city council decisions
    And I maintain: human judgment over agent information
    And agent enhances: my understanding without replacing leadership
