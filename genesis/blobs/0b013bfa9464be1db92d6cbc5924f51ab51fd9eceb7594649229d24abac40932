Scenario: Grandparent-grandchild relationships maintained despite limitations
    Given Helen's mobility and cognitive limitations affect interaction
    And grandchildren want relationship with Helen
    When grandparent-grandchild connection is facilitated
    Then the family_elohim should coordinate visits that don't overwhelm Helen
    And communication should be adapted to her capabilities
    And grandchildren should be guided on how to interact respectfully
    And Helen's contributions to grandchildren should be recognized
    And relationships should be preserved despite changing capabilities
    And the protocol should support connection across limitations
    And grandchildren should learn to value elders through maintained relationship
