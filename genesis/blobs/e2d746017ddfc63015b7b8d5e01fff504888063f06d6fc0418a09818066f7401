Scenario: Young child contributes to family decision making appropriately
    Given the family is making decisions about meals
    And Tommy has preferences and care intentions
    When Tommy's input is solicited through the scanner
    Then his preferences should be honored age-appropriately
    And his care intentions (choosing for others) should carry weight
    And the family_elohim should balance Tommy's input with family needs
    And Tommy should experience having voice in family governance
    And his participation should be genuine, not token
    And family decisions should reflect that all members contribute
