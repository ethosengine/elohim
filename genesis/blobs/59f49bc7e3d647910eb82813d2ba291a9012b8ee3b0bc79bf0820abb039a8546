Scenario: Owner lifts crushing burden of sole responsibility
    Given Rosa carries weight of three employees' livelihoods alone
    And she cannot vacation, get sick, or take breaks without business crisis
    When EAE acquisition completes
    Then Rosa is freed from sole responsibility for business survival
    And employees are protected and elevated to co-owners
    And Rosa can exit completely or stay as transition steward
    And crushing weight of individual ownership is distributed democratically
    And workplace_elohim ensures transition protects all parties
