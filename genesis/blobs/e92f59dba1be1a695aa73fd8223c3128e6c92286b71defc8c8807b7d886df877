Scenario: Offering specialized knowledge or skills to community despite crisis circumstances
    Given I have professional skills, knowledge, or experience that could help others
    And crisis circumstances don't erase my capabilities
    When community members could benefit from my expertise
    Then the Value Scanner surfaces opportunities to share my knowledge
    And facilitates skill-sharing and mentorship relationships
    And recognizes my expertise contributions with care tokens
    And validates that crisis doesn't eliminate my competence
    And helps me contribute in ways that match my current capacity
    And my personal_agent identifies good matches for my skills
    And tracks my knowledge contributions to community
    And celebrates that I am valuable community resource
