Scenario: Developer track record follows across jurisdictions
    Given a developer broke promises in one municipality
    And now seeks approval in neighboring jurisdiction
    When the Observer provides cross-jurisdictional track record
    Then planning commission sees: developer promised 150 jobs, delivered 18
    And community benefits agreement was not honored
    And pattern shows developer moves to new jurisdiction after burning bridges
    And regional transparency prevents serial extraction
    And developers can't escape accountability through relocation
