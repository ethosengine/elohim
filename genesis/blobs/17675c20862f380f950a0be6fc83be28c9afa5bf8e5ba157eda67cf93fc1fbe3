Scenario: Responsible developer advocates for sensible state housing policy
    Given state housing regulations create barriers to affordable development
    And a responsible developer wants to build more affordable housing
    When the Observer provides state policy navigation and advocacy tools
    Then the developer understands state regulatory framework
    And identifies which regulations genuinely protect community versus serve NIMBYism
    And engages in transparent policy advocacy for streamlined affordable housing approval
    And makes case based on evidence not just developer profit
    And transparent advocacy distinguishes from corrupt lobbying
