Scenario: Parent receives child-focused community updates
    Given the parent works shifts and has 15 minutes during lunch
    And community decisions were made last night about parks and safety
    When the parent checks their morning brief
    Then they see only decisions affecting their children's bus stops, parks, and routes
    And the summary takes 3 minutes to read
    And jargon is translated to real impacts ("longer walk," "no crossing guard")
    And the parent can submit feedback during their break
    And civic engagement fits into a working parent's schedule
