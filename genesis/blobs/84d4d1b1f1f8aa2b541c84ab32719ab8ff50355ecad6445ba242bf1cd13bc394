Scenario: Journalist develops sources through community surveillance
    Given the journalist needs community perspectives on proposed development
    And doesn't know who has relevant knowledge
    When the Observer identifies community members affected by issue
    Then the journalist sees residents who testified at past meetings
    And identifies homeowners on blocks facing displacement
    And finds small business owners who will lose customers
    And contacts informed sources with lived experience
    And community journalism reflects actual community voices
