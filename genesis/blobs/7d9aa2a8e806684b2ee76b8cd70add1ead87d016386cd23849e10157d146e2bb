Scenario: Disability community mutual aid networks coordinate support
    Given disabled people practice mutual aid extensively
    And peer support networks are essential for survival and flourishing
    When the community_elohim tracks disability community care flows
    Then mutual aid within disability community should be highly valued
    And Alex's participation in peer networks should accumulate tokens
    And care should be recognized as flowing in multiple directions
    And disability mutual aid should be seen as care economy infrastructure
    And the protocol should honor interdependence as community practice
    And peer support should be valued as essential care work
    And disabled people's care for each other should be made visible
