Scenario: Establishing liability framework for agent errors
    Given agents will make mistakes
    And someone must address harms
    When I create liability and accountability legislation
    Then I establish: protocol insurance pool for errors
    And I specify: remedies for different types of mistakes
    And I require: immediate correction and compensation
    And I penalize: bad-faith attempts to corrupt agents
    And I balance: accountability with innovation
    And framework: enables learning from mistakes
    And responsibility: is clear without stifling development
