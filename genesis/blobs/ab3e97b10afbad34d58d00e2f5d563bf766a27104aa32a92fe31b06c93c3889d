Scenario: Wonder-preserving interface for making care choices
    Given Tommy is using the Value Scanner for the first time
    And the interface is optimized for ages 5-7
    When Tommy opens the scanner application
    Then the interface should display large, colorful icons
    And the personal_agent should use warm, encouraging voice guidance
    And no text requiring reading ability should be mandatory
    And the interface should preserve the magic of choice-making
    And no gamification or point systems should be present
