Scenario: Organizer detects organizing opportunity from community complaint patterns
    Given 47 residents across three blocks have reported the same landlord issues
    And most residents don't know others are affected
    When the Observer detects the shared grievance pattern
    Then the organizer sees the organizing opportunity alert
    And receives contact information for residents who opted in
    And views specific issues by building and timeline
    And gets recommended organizing approach for tenant association
    And isolated frustration becomes basis for collective action
