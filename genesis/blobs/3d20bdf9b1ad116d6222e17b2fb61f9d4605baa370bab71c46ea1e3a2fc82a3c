Scenario: Organizer builds cross-neighborhood budget justice coalition
    Given parents care about after-school programs being cut
    And seniors need meal delivery services maintained
    And workers depend on subsidized transit
    When the organizer uses Observer to identify alignment
    Then they see all three groups affected by same budget priorities
    And facilitate coordination across five neighborhoods
    And maintain shared information base on budget impacts
    And coordinate 100 residents for budget hearing testimony
    And diverse communities unite around shared municipal interests
