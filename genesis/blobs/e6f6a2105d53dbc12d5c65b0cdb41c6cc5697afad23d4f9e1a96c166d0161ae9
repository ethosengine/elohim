Scenario: Accessing family support during work crisis
    Given my work demands sometimes become overwhelming
    When I need family support during difficult work periods
    Then the protocol should help me ask for help
    And coordinate family support when I am struggling
    And enable reciprocity when my situation improves
    And recognize that care flows both ways in family systems
