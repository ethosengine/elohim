Scenario: Cross-sector care economy collaboration facilitated
    Given care economy affects all industry sectors
    And cross-sector collaboration could advance shared goals
    And Robert's professional networks span multiple sectors
    When industry_elohim facilitates cross-sector collaboration
    Then it should connect Robert with care economy advocates across sectors
    And support development of cross-sector care economy initiatives
    And help build coalitions for policy advocacy
    And share best practices across industry boundaries
    And build care economy movement that transcends sector divisions
    And demonstrate that care economy is universal across industries
    And advance transformation through cross-sector solidarity
