Scenario: Teacher participates in school policy decisions
    Given the school site council is revising discipline policy
    And teachers have frontline knowledge about what works
    When the Observer facilitates teacher input on policy options
    Then teachers share evidence-based practices anonymously
    And successful approaches from other schools are surfaced
    And student outcome data informs policy design
    And final policy reflects teacher professional expertise
    And school governance becomes genuinely participatory
