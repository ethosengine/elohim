Scenario: Coordinating household care during schedule conflicts
    Given my work schedule conflicts with household needs
    When household tasks need completion and I am working
    Then the protocol should help coordinate coverage
    And enable roommates to handle urgent needs
    And track that I contribute when available
    And maintain fairness over time despite schedule conflicts
