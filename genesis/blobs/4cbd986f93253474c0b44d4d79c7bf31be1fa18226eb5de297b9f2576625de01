Scenario: Participating in neighborhood mutual aid networks
    Given Margaret has time, skills, and motivation to help neighbors
    And she also has needs that neighbors can help with
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates mutual aid
    Then Margaret should be connected to reciprocal care networks
    And her contributions (childcare help, elder checking, skills) should be tracked
    And support she receives (technology help, heavy lifting, transportation) should be tracked
    And the framing should be mutual aid, not charity in either direction
    And Margaret both gives and receives in neighborhood care economy
    And dignity should be preserved through reciprocity framework
