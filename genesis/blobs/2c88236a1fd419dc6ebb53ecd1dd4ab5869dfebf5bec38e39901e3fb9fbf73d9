Scenario: Retirement planning affected by grandparenting commitments
    Given Margaret and Robert had retirement plans and dreams
    And substantial grandparenting changes household capacity for travel and activities
    When the household plans retirement lifestyle
    Then the household_elohim should help balance care and retirement goals
    And it should ensure grandparenting doesn't entirely subsume retirement plans
    And it should help negotiate sustainable care arrangements
    And both partners should be able to enjoy retirement
    And household should maintain autonomy over retirement choices
    And grandparenting should enhance rather than replace retirement
