Feature: Age-Appropriate Interest Communities for Child
  As a child in the social_medium system
  Operating at the affinity_network governance layer
  I want to pursue my interests with others who share them
  So that I can develop skills, make friends, and explore my passions safely

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the child user is registered in the system
    And the affinity_network governance context is active
    And Emma, age 12, has earned neighborhood reach through good judgment

  Scenario: Child joins age-appropriate interest community
    Given Emma loves drawing manga-style art
    When she discovers a youth manga artists community in her region
    And the community is moderated and age-appropriate (ages 10-16)
    Then she can request to join through her parent's approval
    And her parents see the community charter and moderator information
    And upon approval, she gains access to the creative space
    And she can share art, get feedback, and learn techniques
    And all participants are age-verified and properly supervised

  Scenario: Child learns from elder mentor in safe context
    Given Emma has been active in the manga community for 6 months
    And she shows dedication and growing skill
    When an elder community artist offers mentorship
    Then the matching agent verifies the elder's background and trustworthiness
    And the mentorship is structured with appropriate boundaries
    And Emma's parents are notified and can approve the arrangement
    And mentorship interactions are visible to community moderators
    And Emma receives valuable guidance in a safe learning relationship

  Scenario: Child's creative work spreads through earned reach
    Given Emma creates a manga story about environmental conservation
    And she shares it in her manga artists community
    When other young artists appreciate and share her work
    And the story demonstrates both artistic skill and positive values
    Then the work travels through network based on genuine appreciation
    And it reaches other youth environmental and art communities
    And Emma experiences validation for quality contribution
    And she learns that good work naturally finds its audience
    And no algorithmic manipulation or viral exploitation occurs

  Scenario: Child prevented from exposure to inappropriate content
    Given Emma participates in the manga community
    When an older teen posts art with mature themes
    And the content is not appropriate for younger members
    Then the guardian agent prevents Emma from seeing the mature content
    And the moderator is notified to evaluate the post
    And age-appropriate content guidelines are reinforced
    And Emma's experience remains safe and appropriate to her development
    And the older teen receives guidance about age-appropriate spaces
