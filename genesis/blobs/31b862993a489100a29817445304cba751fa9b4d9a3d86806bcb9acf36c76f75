Scenario: Term limits protect me from capture while preserving learning
    Given I have served my 3-month community council term
    And I have developed constitutional literacy and deliberation skills
    When my term ends and I return to nursing work
    Then I cannot: serve consecutive terms or be reappointed
    And I cannot: build career in council governance
    And I am protected: from lobbying, corruption, or capture
    And I carry forward: constitutional understanding into community life
    And I remain: engaged citizen with enhanced democratic capacity
    And my institutional knowledge: is preserved through documentation
    And fresh perspectives: replace mine to prevent ossification
