Scenario: Developer apprenticeship commitment creates lasting benefit
    Given a responsible developer commits to workforce development
    And partners with unions and training programs
    When the Observer tracks workforce development outcomes
    Then analysis shows: 35 apprentices trained across three projects
    And 28 completed programs and gained journey-level employment
    And investment in workforce development creates lasting community benefit
    And genuine partnerships distinguish from token training gestures
    And workforce development commitment creates positive legacy
