Scenario: Development of conscious values and identity around care
    Given Marcus is forming conscious values and identity
    And he is developing abstract thinking capacity
    When Marcus makes repeated care decisions over time
    Then he should be developing identity as capable caregiver
    And his values around family responsibility should be consciously forming
    And the system should support healthy identity development
    And he should see himself as person who takes care of his family
    And care economy principles should shape his developing worldview
    And his self-concept should be as contributor, not burden
