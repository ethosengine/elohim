Scenario: Quality standards improve through democratic supply chain accountability
    Given corporate food system often degrades quality for profit maximization
    And quality claims are marketing, not enforceable accountability
    When democratic supply chain implements transparent quality documentation
    Then farming practices are witnessed and documented (soil health, pest management, harvest quality)
    And restaurant food preparation is transparent to customers
    And quality accountability flows throughout chain
    And standards continuously improve through democratic feedback and learning
