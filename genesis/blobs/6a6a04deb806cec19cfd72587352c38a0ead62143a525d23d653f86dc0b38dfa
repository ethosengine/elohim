Scenario: Accessibility features support diverse learning needs
    Given Emma may have varied learning needs
    And accessibility is required for equitable education
    When Emma uses educational features of the scanner
    Then multiple modalities should be available (visual, audio, text)
    And reading support should be provided as needed
    And math scaffolding should be accessible
    And voice guidance should be option
    And interface should serve children with diverse abilities
    And educational access should be universal
