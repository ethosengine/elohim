Feature: Family Care Participation for Workers
  As a worker maintaining family connections
  I need to participate in family care despite employment constraints
  So that I can honor family relationships while managing work demands

  Background:
    Given I am a worker with family care responsibilities
    And my work schedule limits my availability for family
    And family members are distributed geographically
    And the family_elohim coordinates care across distance

  Scenario: Maintaining family connection despite limited time
    Given my work schedule leaves minimal time for family
    When I want to stay connected to parents and siblings
    Then the family_elohim should help me maintain meaningful connection
    And suggest efficient ways to participate in family care
    And recognize that my work constraints don't diminish my care commitment
    And coordinate around my limited availability

  Scenario: Contributing to aging parent care from distance
    Given my parents are aging and need increasing support
    And I work full-time with unpredictable schedule
    And I cannot provide hands-on daily care
    When the family coordinates parent care
    Then the protocol should help me contribute within my capacity
    And identify non-time-intensive ways I can support
    And coordinate with siblings who may have different availability
    And recognize my contributions even when limited by employment

  Scenario: Supporting family members during crisis
    Given a family member experiences health crisis or emergency
    When I want to help but have employment obligations
    Then the protocol should help me assess my options
    And coordinate with other family members for coverage
    And help me communicate with my employer about family needs
    And support me in balancing work demands with family care

  Scenario: Coordinating financial support for family
    Given my income is limited but family may need support
    When family members need financial help
    Then the protocol should help me assess what I can contribute
    And coordinate financial support across family network
    And recognize that my economic constraints are real
    And facilitate fair distribution of financial responsibility

  Scenario: Sharing care work across sibling network
    Given siblings may have different capacities for family care
    And my work schedule limits my hands-on participation
    When the family needs ongoing care coordination
    Then the protocol should help distribute care work fairly
    And recognize that my employment constraints affect availability
    And identify where I can contribute given my limitations
    And support negotiation toward equitable family care distribution

  Scenario: Participating in family celebrations despite work
    Given family gatherings and celebrations matter for connection
    And my work schedule may conflict with family events
    When family plans celebrations or important gatherings
    Then the protocol should help me advocate for work schedule changes
    And coordinate around my employment constraints when necessary
    And help me participate meaningfully even if time is limited
    And recognize that family care includes celebration and joy

  Scenario: Recognizing invisible family care labor
    Given I provide emotional support, communication, and coordination
    Even when I cannot provide hands-on care
    When family members track care contributions
    Then the protocol should recognize all forms of care work
    And make visible my emotional labor and communication work
    And validate that staying connected is valuable care contribution
    And ensure I am not invisibilized due to employment constraints

  Scenario: Navigating family expectations about availability
    Given family members may not understand my work constraints
    When family expects more availability than I can provide
    Then the protocol should help me communicate my limitations
    And provide evidence of my actual time and energy constraints
    And support me in setting realistic boundaries
    And help family understand that my constraints reflect employment structure not lack of care

  Scenario: Accessing family support during work crisis
    Given my work demands sometimes become overwhelming
    When I need family support during difficult work periods
    Then the protocol should help me ask for help
    And coordinate family support when I am struggling
    And enable reciprocity when my situation improves
    And recognize that care flows both ways in family systems

  Scenario: Coordinating care for family members I support
    Given I may have dependents or family I support financially
    When my care responsibilities extend beyond myself
    Then the protocol should help me coordinate care for dependents
    And optimize limited resources across family needs
    And connect me to support systems for working families
    And recognize that work-family balance requires systemic support

  Scenario: Building family care resilience across generations
    Given family care needs span generations
    When family members support each other across life stages
    Then the protocol should coordinate intergenerational care
    And recognize contributions from all generations
    And facilitate sustainable care distribution
    And support family care economy across time

  Scenario: Documenting family care for workplace advocacy
    Given family care responsibilities are real and ongoing
    When I need to advocate for family-friendly workplace policies
    Then the protocol should help me document family care demands
    And provide evidence of work-family conflict
    And support me in requesting accommodations or policy changes
    And empower me to advocate for care-economy-aligned employment
