Scenario: Municipal food assistance programs accessed with dignity
    Given Margaret's budget is tight at $150/week
    And municipal SNAP or food assistance may be available
    When the municipality_elohim identifies assistance eligibility
    Then Margaret should be informed without stigma
    And enrollment should be simple and dignified
    And her care contributions should be visible alongside receiving benefits
    And the framing should be community resource access
    And participation should feel like claiming entitlement, not begging
    And municipal assistance should support fixed-income seniors
