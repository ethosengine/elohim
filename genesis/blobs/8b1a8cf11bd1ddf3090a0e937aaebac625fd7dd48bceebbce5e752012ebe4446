Scenario: Workers exercise governance voice weighted by documented contribution
    Given REA accounting documents each worker's contributions over time
    And democratic governance weights votes by contribution and seniority
    When workers vote on major strategic decisions
    Then Maria's 8 years of documented expertise weights her vote higher
    And newer workers have proportional but meaningful voice
    And weighting is transparent and democratically adjustable
    And workplace_elohim ensures weighting doesn't become oligarchic
    And all workers maintain baseline voice protecting their dignity
