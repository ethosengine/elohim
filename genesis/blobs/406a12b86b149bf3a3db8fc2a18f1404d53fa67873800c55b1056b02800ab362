Scenario: Family care token flows reflect Alex's substantial contributions
    Given Alex contributes significantly to family care economy
    And traditional family roles often render disabled people's contributions invisible
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Alex's emotional labor should accumulate tokens appropriately
    And Alex's advocacy improving accessibility benefits whole family
    And Alex's peer support to other disabled family members should be valued
    And care tokens should flow to Alex for contributions, not just from Alex as recipient
    And family economics should recognize Alex's care work explicitly
    And the data should challenge family narratives of Alex as burden
    And Alex's economic standing within family should reflect actual contributions
