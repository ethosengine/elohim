Scenario: Workplace recognizes employees' care responsibilities
    Given Sarah balances full-time teaching with intensive parenting
    And her care responsibilities affect her work capacity
    When workplace policies are designed
    Then the workplace_elohim should make employees' care work visible
    And Sarah's care responsibilities should be recognized, not ignored
    And workplace should acknowledge that workers have lives beyond employment
    And policies should support work-care integration, not create conflict
    And care economy should inform workplace culture
