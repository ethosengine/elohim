Scenario: Making visible that food work is care for people and planet
    Given all food work serves human nourishment and ecological cycles
    And food workers are caring for people and participating in bioregional systems
    When the broader culture treats food work as low-value service
    Then the protocol should make visible that food work is essential care labor
    And reframe food service as care work for human and ecological flourishing
    And advocate that food workers deserve dignity, fair compensation, and care-aligned conditions
    And build consciousness that care economy includes ecological care and all food work serves life
