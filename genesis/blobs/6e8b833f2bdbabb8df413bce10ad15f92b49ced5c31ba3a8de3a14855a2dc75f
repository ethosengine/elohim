Scenario: Industry quality standards improve through democratic governance demonstration
    Given franchise standardization claimed to ensure quality but often degraded it
    And profit maximization pressured operators to cut quality whenever possible
    When democratic locations demonstrate higher quality through worker ownership
    Then industry benchmarks shift toward democratic quality standards
    And customers learn to expect better quality from democratically-operated establishments
    And competitive pressure forces remaining franchises to improve quality
    And sector reputation improves through democratic operations raising standards
