Feature: Individual Worker Self-Care and Autonomy
  As a worker balancing employment and care needs
  I need to maintain individual autonomy and self-care despite work demands
  So that I can preserve my dignity, health, and capacity for human flourishing

  Background:
    Given I am a worker with irregular employment schedule
    And I have limited time and energy for self-care
    And my personal_agent monitors my well-being
    And the protocol recognizes my care work as valuable

  Scenario: Managing self-care with unpredictable work schedule
    Given my work schedule changes weekly with different shift patterns
    And I need to maintain basic nutrition and rest
    When my personal_agent detects schedule changes
    Then it should adapt my meal planning to available time slots
    And suggest efficient meal prep strategies for my schedule
    And protect time blocks for essential self-care
    And remind me that my well-being matters despite work demands

  Scenario: Recognizing my own labor as care contribution
    Given I work 50+ hours per week as a line cook
    And I prepare food for hundreds of people daily
    When I view my work through the care economy lens
    Then the protocol should recognize my labor as care work
    And accumulate care tokens reflecting my contribution to community nourishment
    And show me that my work has dignity and social value
    And reframe my relationship to labor from pure exploitation to meaningful contribution

  Scenario: Tracking self-care achievements despite exhaustion
    Given I am exhausted after double shifts
    And self-care feels impossible
    When I manage to cook a nutritious meal for myself
    Or maintain my living space
    Or get adequate sleep
    Then the protocol should recognize these achievements
    And validate that caring for myself is valuable work
    And celebrate small victories in maintaining well-being
    And build evidence that I deserve conditions that make self-care possible

  Scenario: Detecting when work demands destroy self-care capacity
    Given my personal_agent monitors my nutrition and rest patterns
    When my meal quality decreases for multiple consecutive days
    And my sleep falls below healthy minimums
    And I show signs of chronic exhaustion
    Then the protocol should surface a crisis alert
    And provide resources for immediate support
    And suggest workplace advocacy options
    And connect me to community care resources

  Scenario: Managing tight budget for individual needs
    Given I earn $32k/year and have $60/week food budget
    And I need to maximize nutritional value per dollar
    When I plan my grocery shopping
    Then the protocol should provide sophisticated budget optimization
    And suggest high-value nutritious ingredients
    And identify sales and discounts at accessible stores
    And help me stretch limited resources without sacrificing health

  Scenario: Protecting individual autonomy under employment pressure
    Given my employer demands maximum flexibility
    And employment pressure threatens my autonomy
    When I need to maintain boundaries for self-care
    Then my personal_agent should help me recognize when boundaries are violated
    And support me in protecting essential personal time
    And remind me that I have rights beyond being a labor unit
    And provide language for asserting my needs

  Scenario: Meal prepping efficiently with limited energy
    Given I have only 2 hours between shifts to prepare meals
    And I am already exhausted from work
    When I need to prep food for the next several days
    Then the protocol should suggest maximum-efficiency meal prep strategies
    And provide step-by-step guidance requiring minimal cognitive load
    And optimize for nutritional value, cost, and preparation time
    And recognize this household labor as valuable care work

  Scenario: Building individual resilience through care work visibility
    Given the protocol tracks all my care contributions
    Including my paid labor and household self-care
    When I review my care economy participation
    Then I should see comprehensive evidence of my contributions
    And understand that I am providing valuable service to community
    And recognize that I deserve better compensation and conditions
    And feel empowered to advocate for my needs

  Scenario: Accessing individual health monitoring
    Given work conditions threaten my physical and mental health
    When my personal_agent detects warning signs
    Such as declining nutrition, inadequate rest, or chronic stress
    Then it should provide gentle health monitoring
    And surface accessible healthcare resources
    And help me understand my rights to workplace accommodations
    And support me in prioritizing my health despite work pressure

  Scenario: Planning personal development despite time constraints
    Given I have skills and interests beyond my current job
    And employment leaves minimal time for personal development
    When I want to learn new skills or pursue interests
    Then the protocol should help me find micro-opportunities
    And connect me to accessible learning resources
    And recognize that my growth and flourishing matter
    And support me in maintaining identity beyond worker role

  Scenario: Documenting personal needs for advocacy
    Given I experience specific challenges due to work conditions
    When I want to advocate for changes
    Then the protocol should help me document my needs
    And provide evidence of how current conditions affect my well-being
    And support me in articulating what I need to thrive
    And empower me to advocate for care-economy-aligned workplace policies
