Scenario: Neighborhood care economy scales to municipal level
    Given Sarah's neighborhood successfully implements care economy
    And multiple neighborhoods could coordinate similarly
    When neighborhood care patterns are established
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect to municipal systems
    And it should enable scaling of successful practices
    And neighborhood should serve as building block for municipal care economy
    And local success should inform broader policy
    And care economy should grow from neighborhood up, not top-down
