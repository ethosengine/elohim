Scenario: Organizer tracks accountability for community park improvements
    Given the organizer led campaign that won park renovation commitment
    And city promised completion in six months
    When the Observer tracks implementation progress
    Then the organizer sees weekly updates on construction status
    And receives alerts when timeline slips
    And documents the victory for community to see their power
    And has evidence to pressure officials if implementation stalls
    And communities learn their organizing creates real change
