Scenario: Connecting retired residents for mutual support networks
    Given Frank is one of several retired residents in the neighborhood
    And retired people have time to build mutual support systems
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates among retired residents
    Then it should help Frank connect with other retired neighbors
    And facilitate mutual aid networks among those with time availability
    And coordinate skill sharing across retired residents
    And support check-in systems for isolated or vulnerable neighbors
    And build neighborhood resilience through retired resident networks
    And enable Frank to both give and receive neighborhood support
