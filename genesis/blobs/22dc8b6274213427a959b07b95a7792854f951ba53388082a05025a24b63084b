Scenario: Parent exposes systematic school funding inequities
    Given the parent's child attends an eastside elementary school
    And suspects their school gets fewer resources than westside schools
    When the parent reviews Observer's district funding analysis
    Then they see westside schools spend $2,400 more per student
    And westside schools have experienced teachers and enrichment programs
    And eastside schools have newer teachers and cut arts programs
    And pattern of inequity becomes documented and undeniable
    And parent advocacy shifts from suspicion to evidence-based demands
