Scenario: Addressing global inequality in protocol access
    Given research shows protocol adoption correlates with national wealth
    And poor nations lack infrastructure for implementation
    When I advocate for global equity in access
    Then I promote: international funding mechanisms
    And I support: technology transfer without strings attached
    And I push: for open source hardware and software
    And I challenge: intellectual property barriers to adoption
    And I ensure: protocol doesn't exacerbate global inequality
    And I work: for democratic AI governance as universal right
    And I recognize: justice requires addressing structural barriers
