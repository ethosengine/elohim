Scenario: Organizer generates accessible materials for citywide campaign
    Given the coalition is campaigning against developer tax breaks
    And needs to explain complex tax increment financing to residents
    When the organizer requests education materials from Observer
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of TIF mechanics
    And see actual dollar flows (who benefits, who pays)
    And get talking points for testimony and media
    And access fact-checking data to counter developer claims
    And technical policy becomes accessible community education
