Scenario: Learning that personhood and growth continue until death
    Given culture often treats elderly as finished developing
    And Helen continues to learn and grow at 82
    When Helen engages with educational opportunities
    Then the protocol should affirm that learning never ends
    And growth should be supported at all ages
    And Helen should experience ongoing development
    And new capabilities should be acknowledged and celebrated
    And education should reject notion that personhood ends with productivity decline
    And the protocol should model that humans grow throughout life
    And Helen should learn that she remains person until death
