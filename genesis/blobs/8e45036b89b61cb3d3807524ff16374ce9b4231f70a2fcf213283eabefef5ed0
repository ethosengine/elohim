Scenario: Parent coordinates opposition to program cuts
    Given the board proposes eliminating elementary music programs
    And the parent's child participates in school band
    When the Observer connects parents across district whose children affected
    Then 230 families from 8 schools form coordinated coalition
    And present unified testimony on music education benefits
    And propose alternative budget cuts that preserve student programs
    And district-wide parent power prevents program elimination
    And children's enrichment programs are preserved
