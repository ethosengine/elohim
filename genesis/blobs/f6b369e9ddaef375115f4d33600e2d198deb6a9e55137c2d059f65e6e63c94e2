Scenario: Reduced consumption wisdom from experience of less
    Given Helen grew up with material scarcity
    And she knows how to live well with less
    When Helen shares wisdom about reduced consumption
    Then her experience should inform degrowth and sustainability education
    And consumer capitalism should be challenged by her lived alternative
    And younger generations should learn that happiness doesn't require endless acquisition
    And Helen should be valued for knowledge that contradicts market economics
    And the protocol should surface elder wisdom about sufficiency
    And ecological sustainability should learn from those who lived with less
    And Helen's experience should teach that less can be enough
