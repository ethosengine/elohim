Scenario: Protecting seniors from municipal surveillance while enabling services
    Given Margaret participates in municipal programs
    And municipal systems collect data
    When the municipality_elohim manages Margaret's municipal data
    Then her privacy must be protected from surveillance
    And service access should not require surrendering privacy
    And data collection should be minimal and purposeful
    And Margaret should control what municipal government knows
    And elder surveillance should be prevented
    And dignity should be preserved in all municipal interactions
