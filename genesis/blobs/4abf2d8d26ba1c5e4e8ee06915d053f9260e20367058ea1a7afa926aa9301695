Scenario: Family cultural recognition of caregiving as sacred work
    Given some cultural traditions honor caregiving as sacred
    And family culture may recognize James's care work meaningfully
    When the family_elohim tracks cultural care values
    Then it should recognize cultural frameworks that honor caregiving
    And it should support family cultural practices around care
    And cultural recognition should supplement economic recognition
    And diverse family cultures should be respected and valued
    And care economy should align with family cultural values
