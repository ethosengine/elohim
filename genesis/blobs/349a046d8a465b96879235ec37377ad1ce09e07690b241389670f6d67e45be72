Scenario: Access to senior nutrition programs without stigma
    Given Margaret manages nutrition on $32k/year fixed income
    And municipal senior nutrition programs exist
    When the municipality_elohim connects Margaret to food resources
    Then she should be informed about senior meal programs
    And Meals on Wheels or congregate dining should be accessible
    And the framing should be senior service, not poverty relief
    And Margaret should access programs with dignity
    And her care contributions should be visible to counterbalance receiving
    And municipal food resources should support senior health
