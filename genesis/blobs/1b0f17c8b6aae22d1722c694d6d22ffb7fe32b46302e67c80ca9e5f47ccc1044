Scenario: Municipal transparency dashboard for public accountability
    Given residents deserve visibility into city governance
    And I am accountable through democratic elections
    When we provide municipal transparency dashboard
    Then residents see: resource flows across neighborhoods
    And they access: appeal patterns and council decisions
    And they view: city budget allocation and outcomes
    And they compare: promised benefits with actual results
    And they hold me accountable: with evidence not just rhetoric
    And transparency strengthens: democratic governance
    And I cannot hide: behind "algorithm decided" or "trust me"
