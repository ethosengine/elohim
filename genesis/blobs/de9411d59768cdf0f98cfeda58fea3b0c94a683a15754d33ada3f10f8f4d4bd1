Scenario: Distributing grandparenting labor equitably between partners
    Given both Margaret and Robert are retired and available
    And Margaret currently does most of the grandchild care
    When the household_elohim tracks care contributions
    Then it should show Margaret's 25 hours/week of grandchild care
    And it should show Robert's care contributions (if any)
    And it should identify if care labor is unequally distributed
    And it should facilitate discussion about equitable distribution
    And both partners should contribute to grandparenting
    And Margaret should not bear sole burden of care work
    And household care economy should be equitable
