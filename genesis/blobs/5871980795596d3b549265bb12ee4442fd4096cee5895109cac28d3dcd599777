Scenario: Appeal involving cultural specificity vs constitutional minimums
    Given my community has cultural practices that differ from regional norms
    And an agent decision applied regional default rather than local calibration
    When I appeal based on cultural context
    Then Regional Constitutional Council evaluates legitimate cultural diversity
    And They distinguish between cultural variation and constitutional violations
    And They examine if my community had ability to calibrate protocol appropriately
    And They consider if agent should have recognized cultural context
    And They balance universal human dignity with cultural specificity
    And The precedent clarifies how constitutional minimums apply across cultures
    And My appeal protects cultural diversity within constitutional framework
