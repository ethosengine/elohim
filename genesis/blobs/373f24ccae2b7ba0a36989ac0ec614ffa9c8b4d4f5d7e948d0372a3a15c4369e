Scenario: Learning value literacy, not just price comparison
    Given Emma is building complex understanding of value
    And value extends far beyond simple price
    When Emma uses the Value Scanner for education
    Then she should learn to see multiple value dimensions
    And nutritional value should be explored
    And environmental impact should be age-appropriately introduced
    And care labor embedded in production should be made visible
    And community benefit should be considered
    And she should learn to read complexity, not just price tags
