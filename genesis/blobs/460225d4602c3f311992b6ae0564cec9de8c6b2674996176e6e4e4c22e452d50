Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained despite complex commitments
    Given Robert has extensive care economy commitments
    And many people depend on his coordination
    And constitutional constraints protect his agency
    When Robert chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then the disconnection must be honored immediately
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
    And his care contributions should be exportable in standard format
    And alternative coordination support should be surfaced for those who depend on him
    And his right to not participate must be respected
    And he should maintain full control over his participation
