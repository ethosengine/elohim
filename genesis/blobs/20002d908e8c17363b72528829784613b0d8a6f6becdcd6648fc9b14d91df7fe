Scenario: Board member understands community priorities beyond meeting testimony
    Given board considers policy change to school calendar
    And testimony at meeting is dominated by teachers union advocating position
    And only 15 community members attended to testify
    When the board member seeks community accountability data from Observer
    Then they see survey data from thousands of district families on calendar preferences
    And discover working families have different priorities than those who testified
    And access childcare impact analysis showing consequences for different populations
    And understand community needs beyond who has time to attend meetings
    And community accountability helps board serve diverse constituent interests
