Scenario: Activist recovers data after device seizure
    Given the activist's device was confiscated during a protest
    And their data was pre-distributed to sanctuary institutions
    When the activist obtains new hardware and initiates recovery
    And they authenticate through biometric and social verification
    And the sanctuary institutions verify the activist's safety and free will
    Then all organizing data, contacts, and history are restored
    And the compromised device's access is permanently revoked
    And the activist resumes organizing with full digital sovereignty
    And the network logs the rights violation for documentation
