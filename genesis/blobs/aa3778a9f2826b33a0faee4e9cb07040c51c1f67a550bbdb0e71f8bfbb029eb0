Scenario: Teacher evaluates budget priorities with evidence
    Given the district approved $2M for new administration positions
    But rejected $800K for reducing class sizes
    When the Observer makes budget trade-offs transparent
    Then teachers see value priorities (administration vs instruction)
    And calculate that rejected proposal would fund 16 teaching positions
    And document that administrative overhead increased 40% in five years
    And organize parents and community around budget priorities
    And fiscal policy becomes professional accountability issue
