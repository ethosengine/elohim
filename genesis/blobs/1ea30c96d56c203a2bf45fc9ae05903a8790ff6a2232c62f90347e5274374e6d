Scenario: Preventing isolation through connection to support networks
    Given solo parenting is profoundly isolating
    And Maria has no co-parent for adult connection and support
    When the personal_agent monitors Maria's social connections
    Then it should detect isolation and loneliness
    And it should help her connect to other single parents
    And it should facilitate community support without requiring more labor from her
    And it should treat social connection as essential, not optional
    And Maria should have pathways out of isolation despite time constraints
