Scenario: Journalist exposes wage theft pattern across employers
    Given workers report unpaid wages and overtime violations
    And the journalist investigates wage theft
    When the Observer analyzes wage violation enforcement data
    Then the journalist sees systematic wage theft across multiple employers
    And identifies industries with concentrated violations
    And documents millions in stolen wages and minimal enforcement
    And shows workers of color disproportionately affected
    And publishes investigation exposing wage theft epidemic
