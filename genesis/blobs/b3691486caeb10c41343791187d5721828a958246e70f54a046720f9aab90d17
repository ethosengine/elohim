Scenario: Journalist investigates playground neglect in underserved neighborhood
    Given residents complain about dangerous playground conditions
    And the journalist needs context on maintenance patterns
    When the Observer provides hyperlocal infrastructure data
    Then the journalist sees playground hasn't been maintained in 5 years
    And compares to monthly maintenance in affluent neighborhoods
    And documents injury reports and resident complaints ignored
    And tracks city budget showing maintenance disparities
    And publishes accountability story on infrastructure racism
