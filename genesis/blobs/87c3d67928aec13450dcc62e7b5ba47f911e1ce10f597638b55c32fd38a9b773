Scenario: Tracking mental load separately from physical tasks
    Given Sarah manages meal planning, scheduling, inventory, coordination
    And mental labor is typically invisible to partners
    When the household_elohim tracks cognitive labor
    Then it should distinguish planning from execution
    And it should show "Sarah performed 89% of household planning labor this week"
    And mental load should be valued as heavily as physical work
    And the partner should see that "helping with dishes" doesn't equal Sarah's total coordination
    And cognitive labor should become visible and valued
    And the full scope of Sarah's work should be undeniable
