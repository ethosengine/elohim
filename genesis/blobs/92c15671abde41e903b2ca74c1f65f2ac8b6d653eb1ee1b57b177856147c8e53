Feature: Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Parent
  As a parent balancing full-time professional work with intensive care labor
  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer
  I want workplace policies that recognize my parenting responsibilities
  So that I can perform both professional and care work sustainably

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah works full-time as a teacher
    And Sarah also manages 75% of household care labor
    And Sarah is mother to Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And the workplace governance context is active
    And the workplace_elohim could coordinate organizational care economy
    And Sarah is trying to balance professional and parenting work

  Scenario: Workplace recognition that parenting is parallel full-time work
    Given Sarah works 40 hours weekly as teacher
    And she also performs 60+ hours weekly of parenting labor
    When the workplace_elohim analyzes Sarah's total work
    Then it should recognize she's working two full-time jobs
    And it should make visible the dual burden she carries
    And workplace should understand why flexibility is essential
    And the system should demonstrate that working parents need support
    And professional expectations should account for parenting responsibilities
    And Sarah's full workload should be undeniably visible

  Scenario: Advocating for family-friendly workplace policies
    Given Sarah needs flexible scheduling to manage children's needs
    And current workplace policies assume workers have no care responsibilities
    When Sarah advocates for policy change
    Then the workplace_elohim should provide supporting data
    And it should show that working parents need flexibility
    And it should help Sarah make evidence-based case for change
    And advocacy labor should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should amplify parent voices in workplace governance
    And workplace should adopt policies that enable sustainable parenting

  Scenario: Parenting skills recognized as professional capabilities
    Given Sarah has professional-grade skills from parenting
    And she manages complex logistics, conflict resolution, developmental psychology
    When the workplace_elohim assesses Sarah's capabilities
    Then it should recognize parenting skills as professional assets
    And it should translate care skills to workplace context
    And Sarah's parenting should enhance her professional value
    And the system should make invisible skills visible to employers
    And parenting experience should be recognized as professional development
    And care work should be valued as capability-building

  Scenario: Workplace boundaries protect time for parenting responsibilities
    Given Sarah has legitimate parenting obligations
    And work often encroaches on family time
    When the workplace_elohim monitors work-life boundaries
    Then it should flag when work is consuming family time
    And it should help Sarah protect necessary parenting time
    And it should validate that parenting obligations are real constraints
    And the system should support boundary-setting with employer
    And workplace demands should not be allowed to destroy family care
    And Sarah should be empowered to say no to overwork

  Scenario: Professional schedule coordination with children's needs
    Given Tommy and Emma have school schedules, activities, appointments
    And Sarah's work schedule must coordinate with family needs
    When the workplace_elohim helps coordinate scheduling
    Then it should integrate work and family calendars
    And it should surface conflicts between professional and parenting obligations
    And it should help Sarah negotiate necessary flexibility
    And the system should recognize scheduling as complex coordination work
    And workplace should accommodate parent scheduling needs
    And Sarah should have tools to manage impossible complexity

  Scenario: Workplace privacy from family care data
    Given Sarah's parenting data should not be accessible to employer
    And strict privacy boundaries are essential
    When workplace and personal systems interact
    Then the workplace must have zero access to family care data
    And Sarah's personal_agent should protect her privacy absolutely
    And the workplace_elohim should respect complete privacy boundaries
    And the system should prevent workplace surveillance of personal life
    And professional and family spheres should remain separate
    And Sarah's care data should be her sovereign information

  Scenario: Fair compensation accounting for care work burden
    Given Sarah performs enormous unpaid care labor
    And this work subsidizes employer by enabling her professional work
    When Sarah negotiates compensation
    Then the workplace_elohim should help her articulate fair pay
    And it should recognize that low wages force families into poverty
    And it should support advocacy for family-sustaining compensation
    And the system should help Sarah argue that fair pay enables family care
    And workplace should pay wages that support household flourishing
    And compensation should reflect total value of human labor

  Scenario: Parental leave recognized as essential workplace benefit
    Given parents need time for infant care, adoption, family crisis
    And parental leave is essential for child well-being
    When the workplace_elohim assesses workplace policies
    Then it should flag inadequate parental leave as care economy violation
    And it should help Sarah advocate for better leave policies
    And the system should recognize parental leave as basic necessity
    And workplace should provide substantial paid parental leave
    And care economy principles should require workplace support for new parents
    And Sarah should have support for advocating for family leave

  Scenario: Managing professional identity alongside parent identity
    Given Sarah is both teacher and mother
    And these identities sometimes conflict or compete
    When Sarah navigates professional and parenting identities
    Then the personal_agent should help her integrate both roles
    And it should recognize she is complete person with multiple identities
    And it should support her wholeness across contexts
    And the system should help her maintain both professional and parent identity
    And neither role should consume total identity
    And Sarah should be supported in being both teacher and mother

  Scenario: Workplace emotional labor while managing parenting stress
    Given Sarah performs emotional labor with students and colleagues
    And she's also managing intense parenting emotional demands
    When the workplace_elohim tracks total emotional labor
    Then it should recognize dual emotional work burden
    And it should flag when emotional demands are unsustainable
    And it should recognize that parents carry compounded emotional labor
    And the system should help Sarah manage total emotional load
    And workplace should understand parents' emotional labor reality
    And Sarah's complete emotional work should be visible and valued

  Scenario: Sick children and workplace accommodation
    Given children get sick frequently
    And Sarah needs to care for sick children
    When Tommy or Emma is sick
    Then the workplace_elohim should help Sarah navigate work accommodations
    And it should recognize parent's obligation to care for sick child
    And it should support requesting necessary time off
    And the system should validate that child care is priority
    And workplace should accommodate parent responsibilities
    And Sarah should not face professional penalty for parenting obligations

  Scenario: Professional development coordinated with parenting constraints
    Given Sarah wants to pursue professional growth
    And she has limited time due to parenting responsibilities
    When Sarah considers professional development opportunities
    Then the workplace_elohim should help her assess feasibility
    And it should integrate family constraints into planning
    And it should help her find development opportunities compatible with parenting
    And professional growth should be possible despite parenting demands
    And the system should support career development for working parents
    And Sarah should not have to choose between career and family
