Scenario: Study group coordination as care economy practice
    Given Kenji participates in study groups with peers
    And study groups require coordination, hosting, and emotional labor
    When the educational_elohim tracks study group participation
    Then it should recognize hosting study group as care contribution
    And it should value coordinating schedules and managing group dynamics
    And it should accumulate care tokens for creating learning spaces
    And study group labor should be visible and valued
    And the system should recognize collective learning as care economy
    And academic collaboration should be understood as mutual care
