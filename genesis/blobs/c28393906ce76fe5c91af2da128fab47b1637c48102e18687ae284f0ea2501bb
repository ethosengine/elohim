Scenario: Neighborhood time bank values all contributions equitably
    Given Robert contributes professional skills and labor
    And neighbors contribute different skills and capacities
    And all contributions have value in care economy
    When neighborhood_elohim manages time bank
    Then it should value Robert's professional mentoring and manual labor equally
    And recognize all neighborhood contributions as care work
    And prevent hierarchy where professional skills are valued more than care labor
    And build neighborhood equity through time bank reciprocity
    And demonstrate care economy principles in practice
    And strengthen neighborhood through mutual recognition
    And create alternative economy based on care rather than market
