Scenario: Developer negotiates regional community benefits agreement
    Given a developer's project has significant regional impacts
    And multiple communities demand input and benefits
    When the Observer facilitates regional benefit negotiations
    Then the developer engages stakeholders from all affected jurisdictions
    And negotiates benefits addressing regional not just local impacts
    And commits to workforce development benefiting regional residents
    And Observer tracks delivery across jurisdictional boundaries
    And regional accountability prevents divide-and-conquer tactics
