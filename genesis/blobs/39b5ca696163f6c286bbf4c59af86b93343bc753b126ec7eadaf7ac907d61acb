Scenario: Creating sunset provisions and mandatory review
    Given laws should be evaluated not permanent
    And I want to prevent ossification
    When I include sunset clauses in legislation
    Then laws expire: after 5-7 years unless renewed
    And I force: regular review of whether laws serve purpose
    And I create: opportunities to correct mistakes
    And I prevent: captured legislation persisting forever
    And democratic accountability: includes ability to reverse decisions
