Scenario: Making invisible household labor distribution visible to partner
    Given Sarah performs 75% of household care labor
    And her partner believes he "helps around the house"
    When the household_elohim generates labor distribution report
    Then it should show precise breakdown of who does what
    And it should quantify "Sarah: 75%, Partner: 25%"
    And the data should be undeniable and specific
    And the partner should see his contribution is not equitable
    And visibility should enable reality-based conversation
    And the system should make invisible labor undeniably visible
