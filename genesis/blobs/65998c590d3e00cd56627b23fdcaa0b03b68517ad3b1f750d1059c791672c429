Scenario: Family care labor made visible to prevent invisible burden
    Given Helen's daughter Sarah provides substantial weekly care
    And Sarah also works and has her own children
    When Sarah assists Helen with shopping, appointments, and household tasks
    Then the family_elohim should make this care work visible
    And Sarah's care labor should be recognized with care tokens
    And the family should see Sarah's contribution quantified
    And Sarah should not feel guilty about needing recognition
    And Helen should understand the care Sarah provides
    And the protocol should prevent invisible exploitation of family caregivers
    And care work should be valued, not taken for granted
