Scenario: Workplace conditions monitored to prevent teen labor exploitation
    Given Jasmine is vulnerable as a young worker
    And young workers often face exploitation
    When workplace_elohim tracks her work conditions
    Then it should monitor whether she's fairly compensated for her labor
    And flag if hours exceed healthy limits
    And recognize if she's asked to work in unsafe conditions
    And track if she's getting required breaks
    And identify if she's experiencing harassment or discrimination
    And surface resources about her rights as a worker
    And provide support if workplace becomes exploitative
