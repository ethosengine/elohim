Feature: Ecological and Bioregional Care Work for Workers in Food Systems
  As a worker in food preparation and service
  I need to understand and participate in ecological care within food systems
  So that my labor contributes to bioregional food sovereignty and environmental flourishing

  Background:
    Given I work in food preparation and see food systems directly
    And I understand the care labor embedded in growing and preparing food
    And the bioregion has food production and distribution systems
    And the protocol recognizes ecological care as part of care economy

  Scenario: Recognizing food systems care work from field to table
    Given my restaurant work is one link in food systems care chain
    And farmers, distributors, and preparers all contribute care labor
    When I view food systems through care economy lens
    Then the protocol should make visible the care work in entire food chain
    And help me understand my connection to farmers and food producers
    And recognize that all food work is care labor serving human nourishment
    And build consciousness about care economy in food systems

  Scenario: Witnessing food waste and understanding ecological cost
    Given I see significant food waste in restaurant operations
    And food waste represents wasted care labor and ecological resources
    When I observe food system inefficiencies
    Then the protocol should help me understand ecological and care economy costs
    And support me in advocating for waste reduction
    And connect me to food rescue or composting initiatives
    And recognize that reducing waste is care work for ecology

  Scenario: Understanding ingredient sourcing and bioregional food
    Given my restaurant uses ingredients from various sources
    And some may be local/seasonal while others are industrial/imported
    When I want to understand food sourcing
    Then the protocol should provide information about ingredient origins
    And help me understand bioregional vs. industrial food systems
    And recognize that bioregional food supports local ecology and economy
    And build consciousness about care economy implications of sourcing

  Scenario: Advocating for sustainable food practices at work
    Given my workplace makes decisions about sourcing and operations
    When I want to advocate for more sustainable and care-aligned practices
    Then the protocol should help me propose sustainable improvements
    Such as local sourcing, waste reduction, composting, sustainable packaging
    And provide evidence for ecological and economic benefits
    And support me in advocating for care-economy-aligned food operations

  Scenario: Connecting with local food producers and farmers
    Given local farmers are doing care work to grow food
    And I am doing care work to prepare food
    When I want to connect with bioregional food producers
    Then the protocol should facilitate connections between workers and farmers
    And support relationships that strengthen local food systems
    And help me understand farming as care labor deserving dignity and fair compensation
    And build solidarity between farm workers and food service workers

  Scenario: Participating in food sovereignty initiatives
    Given corporate food systems extract from workers and communities
    And alternative food systems can support local care economy
    When I want to participate in food sovereignty organizing
    Then the protocol should connect me to food justice initiatives
    And support participation in food co-ops, community agriculture, or food policy
    And recognize my expertise as food worker in food systems transformation
    And build bioregional food systems aligned with care economy

  Scenario: Understanding ecological impact of food systems work
    Given food systems have significant ecological footprint
    And my work is embedded in these systems
    When I want to understand ecological implications
    Then the protocol should provide information about food systems ecology
    And help me see connections between my work and environmental impact
    And support me in making choices that reduce ecological harm
    And recognize that ecological care is part of my care economy participation

  Scenario: Advocating for worker and environmental justice together
    Given worker exploitation and environmental exploitation are connected
    When I organize for worker dignity and fair compensation
    Then the protocol should help me connect labor justice to ecological justice
    And recognize that care economy serves both human and ecological flourishing
    And support advocacy that addresses both worker conditions and environmental sustainability
    And build movements connecting labor rights and environmental protection

  Scenario: Learning about regenerative food systems
    Given current industrial food systems are extractive
    And regenerative agriculture can restore ecological health
    When I want to understand alternatives to industrial food
    Then the protocol should provide education about regenerative food systems
    And connect me to regenerative food initiatives in bioregion
    And help me envision food work that contributes to ecological restoration
    And support transformation toward care-economy-aligned food systems

  Scenario: Participating in composting and food waste reduction
    Given restaurants generate significant compostable waste
    And composting returns nutrients to soil and supports local ecology
    When I want to participate in composting initiatives
    Then the protocol should connect me to composting programs
    And recognize participation in waste reduction as care work
    And support workplace implementation of composting
    And contribute to bioregional nutrient cycling and soil health

  Scenario: Supporting bioregional food security and resilience
    Given bioregions need resilient local food systems
    And my food preparation skills contribute to food security
    When I want to support bioregional food resilience
    Then the protocol should connect me to community food security initiatives
    And help me contribute skills to mutual aid food programs
    And recognize that local food systems support community and ecological resilience
    And build bioregional capacity for food sovereignty

  Scenario: Making visible that food work is care for people and planet
    Given all food work serves human nourishment and ecological cycles
    And food workers are caring for people and participating in bioregional systems
    When the broader culture treats food work as low-value service
    Then the protocol should make visible that food work is essential care labor
    And reframe food service as care work for human and ecological flourishing
    And advocate that food workers deserve dignity, fair compensation, and care-aligned conditions
    And build consciousness that care economy includes ecological care and all food work serves life
