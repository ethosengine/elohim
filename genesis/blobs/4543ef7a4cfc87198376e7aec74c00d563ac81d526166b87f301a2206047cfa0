Scenario: Local store relationships built through consistent presence
    Given Marcus shops weekly at neighborhood stores
    And he is a regular, recognizable customer
    When Marcus builds relationships with store workers
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate positive recognition
    And store workers should see Marcus's care contributions
    And they should understand he's feeding his family, not just shopping
    And informal support networks should develop
    And local relationships should provide informal safety net
    And Marcus should be known and looked after in his neighborhood
