Scenario: Journalist develops whistleblower source in state agency
    Given a state employee witnesses fraud in contract process
    And fears career retaliation for exposing misconduct
    When the Observer provides secure protected channel
    Then the whistleblower shares evidence of fraudulent contracts
    And journalist investigates without exposing source
    And verifies claims through additional reporting and records
    And publishes investigation leading to official inquiry
    And source protection enables accountability journalism
