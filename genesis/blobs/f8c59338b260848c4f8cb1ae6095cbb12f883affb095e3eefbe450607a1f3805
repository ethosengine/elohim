Scenario: Neighborhood solidarity in resource scarcity
    Given Marcus's family faces economic constraints
    And other neighborhood families have similar struggles
    When neighborhood care patterns are visible
    Then Marcus should understand his family is not alone
    And collective challenges should be visible at neighborhood scale
    And solidarity should develop among families facing scarcity
    And the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate mutual support
    And isolation should be reduced through shared understanding
    And political consciousness about systemic issues should begin to form
