Scenario: Low consumption as climate justice leadership
    Given wealthy overconsumption drives climate crisis
    And Maria's low-income household has minimal climate impact
    When climate justice is assessed
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize that Maria is not causing climate crisis
    And it should acknowledge that low-income households bear crisis costs without causing it
    And her low consumption should be honored, not stigmatized
    And climate justice should recognize economic inequality in emissions
    And Maria should be seen as climate leader, not climate burden
