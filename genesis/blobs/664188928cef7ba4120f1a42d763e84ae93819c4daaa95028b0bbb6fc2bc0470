Scenario: Making visible that current conditions prevent care work
    Given my 50+ hour work weeks leave no time or energy for self-care or family care
    When I want to demonstrate that work conditions are unsustainable
    Then the protocol should help me document how work prevents care
    And make visible the contradiction between work demands and human needs
    And provide evidence for advocacy around reduced hours and better conditions
    And build case that "labor shortage" is really "dignity and compensation shortage"
