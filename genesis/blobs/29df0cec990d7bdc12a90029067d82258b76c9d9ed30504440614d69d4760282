Scenario: Right to reduce or discontinue care provision with dignity
    Given Margaret's care contributions are substantial but voluntary
    And her capacity may change with health or life circumstances
    When Margaret needs to reduce or stop grandparenting
    Then the system should support this decision without stigma
    And accumulated care tokens should remain hers regardless
    And the family should have data showing her past contributions
    And Margaret should be able to transition care with dignity
    And she should not feel guilty for setting boundaries
    And the protocol should enable graceful changes in care arrangements
    And her autonomy over care provision must be absolute
