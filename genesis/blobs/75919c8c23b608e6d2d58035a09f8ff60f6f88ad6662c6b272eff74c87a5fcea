Scenario: Family food sharing and meal provision as care contribution
    Given Margaret sometimes cooks meals for her daughter's family
    And she hosts family dinners and holiday meals
    When Margaret's food provision is tracked as care
    Then meal preparation and hosting should be recognized as labor
    And the economic value of meals provided should be calculated
    And family food sharing should be visible care contribution
    And Margaret's cooking and hospitality should be valued
    And food as care should be part of family care economy
    And invisible domestic labor should become visible
