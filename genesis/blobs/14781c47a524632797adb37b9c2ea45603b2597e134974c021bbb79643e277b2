Feature: State-Level Policy Advocacy for Activist
  As an activist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer
  I want to connect local struggles to state policy solutions
  So that structural barriers can be addressed at appropriate scale

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active

  Scenario: Activist identifies state preemption blocking local solutions
    Given the activist's community wants rent control
    But local municipality cannot enact it
    When the Observer explains state preemption law
    Then the activist learns state policy blocks local authority
    And sees which legislators voted for preemption
    And identifies campaign donors (real estate lobby)
    And connects to statewide coalition fighting preemption
    And local organizing scales to state-level campaign

  Scenario: Activist tracks state legislation across session
    Given hundreds of bills move through state legislature
    And the activist cannot attend all hearings
    When the Observer monitors state education legislation
    Then the activist receives alerts on relevant bills
    And sees analysis of policy impacts on students
    And identifies opportunities for testimony
    And tracks which legislators support or oppose
    And statewide advocacy becomes sustainable

  Scenario: Activist exposes corporate lobbying influence
    Given a harmful environmental bill is advancing
    And the activist suspects industry capture
    When the Observer tracks lobbying and donations
    Then the activist sees which companies lobby for the bill
    And views campaign contributions to bill sponsors
    And identifies revolving door between industry and regulators
    And corruption patterns become documented
    And advocacy targets political vulnerabilities

  Scenario: Activist connects local impacts to state policy
    Given state education funding formula harms the activist's district
    And needs to build pressure for reform
    When the Observer calculates local impacts of state policy
    Then the activist shows how formula shortchanges their district by $4M
    And documents impacts on class sizes and programs
    And connects families affected by funding gaps
    And state policy debate becomes grounded in local reality
    And abstract policy becomes personal stakes

  Scenario: Activist coordinates statewide organizing campaign
    Given housing justice activists across 15 cities face same state policy barrier
    And coordination is exhausting without infrastructure
    When the Observer facilitates statewide activist network
    Then activists can share tactics and research
    And coordinate testimony across multiple legislative hearings
    And track campaign progress and legislator commitments
    And distributed organizing becomes coordinated movement
    And state-level power builds through network effects
