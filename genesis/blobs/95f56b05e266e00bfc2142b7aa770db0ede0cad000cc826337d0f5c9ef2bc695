Scenario: Community care contributions connect to municipal governance
    Given Sarah's community care work is substantial
    And municipal policy affects community well-being
    When municipal governance decisions are made
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her voice
    And community care economy data should inform municipal policy
    And care work should be recognized at municipal level
    And Sarah's advocacy should carry weight based on demonstrated contribution
    And care economy should scale from community to municipal governance
