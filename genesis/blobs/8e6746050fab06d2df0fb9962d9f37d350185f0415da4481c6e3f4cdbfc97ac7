Scenario: Developer coordinates multi-jurisdictional project transparently
    Given a developer is planning development spanning three municipalities
    And wants to navigate regional coordination requirements
    When the Observer provides regional process navigation
    Then the developer sees: county planning requirements affect all three jurisdictions
    And identifies regional coordination bodies and approval pathways
    And understands environmental review at regional scale
    And accesses precedents for similar multi-jurisdictional projects
    And navigates complexity transparently not through manipulation
