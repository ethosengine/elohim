Scenario: Community investment outcomes inform municipal workforce development
    Given workforce development programs prepare workers for corporate employment
    And democratic businesses need workers with cooperative governance skills
    When community investors demonstrate democratic business viability
    Then municipal workforce programs add cooperative business and democratic governance training
    And workers are prepared for democratic enterprise participation
    And investor advocacy influences workforce development policy
    And municipal investment in workforce supports democratic economy growth
    And municipality_elohim coordinates democratic business training curriculum development
