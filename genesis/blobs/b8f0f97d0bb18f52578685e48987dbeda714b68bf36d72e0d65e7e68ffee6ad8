Scenario: Multigenerational care coordination across three generations
    Given Frank provides occasional grandchild care
    And he helps maintain his mother-in-law's home
    And he supports his adult children with wisdom and occasional financial help
    When family_elohim coordinates care across generations
    Then it should track care flowing from Frank to grandchildren
    And care flowing from Frank to his mother-in-law
    And support flowing from Frank to adult children
    And emerging care flowing from adult children to Frank
    And all flows should be visible and valued
    And multigenerational reciprocity should be recognized
    And Frank should see himself in ongoing care web
