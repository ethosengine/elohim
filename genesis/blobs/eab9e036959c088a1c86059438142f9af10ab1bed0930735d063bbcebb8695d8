Scenario: Industry compensation models value care contributions
    Given traditional compensation often ignores care skills and contributions
    And compensation models shape industry practice
    And Robert's care skills enhance his professional value
    When industry_elohim advocates for compensation reform
    Then it should help Robert advocate for compensation that values care skills
    And support industry recognition of care work as professional asset
    And help develop compensation frameworks that include care economy metrics
    And build industry norms where care skills command market value
    And prevent care responsibilities from being compensation penalty
    And advance fair compensation through industry standards
    And demonstrate that care economy principles transform compensation
