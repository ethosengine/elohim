Scenario: Board member evaluates superintendent performance with outcome data
    Given board conducts annual superintendent evaluation
    And superintendent's self-evaluation emphasizes accomplishments and progress
    And board wants objective assessment of district performance during tenure
    When the board member uses Observer accountability tracking
    Then they receive longitudinal data on student outcomes since superintendent started
    And see progress on board priorities and strategic plan goals
    And access comparison of district performance trajectory to similar districts
    And discover some promised improvements didn't materialize or regressed
    And objective data helps board evaluate performance beyond self-reporting
