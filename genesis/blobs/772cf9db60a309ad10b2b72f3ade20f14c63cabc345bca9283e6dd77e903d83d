Scenario: Alex maintains complete authority as household manager
    Given Alex coordinates support workers for physical assistance
    And some might assume support workers are in charge
    When household decisions need to be made
    Then Alex should have absolute authority over all household choices
    And support workers should provide services Alex directs
    And the household_elohim should structure Alex as employer/coordinator
    And Alex's autonomy should be protected systematically
    And the relationship should be professional partnership, not caretaking
    And Alex should never be treated as passive recipient of care
    And the protocol should embody Alex's household sovereignty
