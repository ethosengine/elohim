Scenario: Schools recognize single-parent families in forms and communications
    Given school forms typically ask for "mother and father" information
    And communications assume two-parent household availability
    When schools collect family information
    Then the educational_elohim should advocate for single-parent-inclusive forms
    And forms should acknowledge diverse family structures respectfully
    And communications should not assume two parents are available
    And schools should recognize single parents manage everything alone
    And Maria should not have to repeatedly explain or defend her family structure
