Scenario: Participating in family celebrations despite work
    Given family gatherings and celebrations matter for connection
    And my work schedule may conflict with family events
    When family plans celebrations or important gatherings
    Then the protocol should help me advocate for work schedule changes
    And coordinate around my employment constraints when necessary
    And help me participate meaningfully even if time is limited
    And recognize that family care includes celebration and joy
