Scenario: Providing evidence to Senator Ruiz for policy development
    Given Senator Ruiz is drafting AI governance legislation
    And she needs evidence about what regulatory approaches help vs harm
    When I brief her committee on my regional research findings
    Then I present: rigorous evaluation of protocol outcomes
    And I explain: what factors predict successful adoption
    And I provide: evidence about marginalized community access
    And I offer: comparative findings about governance models
    And I testify: honestly about limitations and uncertainties
    And I maintain: independence by reporting truth not advocacy
    And My research becomes: evidence base for democratic policy making
