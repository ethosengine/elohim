Scenario: Investor diversifies across multiple democratic enterprises reducing risk
    Given individual business investment is high-risk
    And Patricia needs diversification for financial security
    When community investment pool spreads capital across multiple conversions
    Then her $10K in pool supports Maria's Kitchen, Rosa's Auto, and neighborhood retail
    And portfolio diversification reduces single-business failure risk
    And democratic network mutual support further reduces risk
    And risk management is transparent and community-governed
    And community_elohim coordinates portfolio diversification and risk management
