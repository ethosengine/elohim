Feature: Interest Communities and Peer Connection for Elder
  As an elder in the social_medium system
  Operating at the affinity_network governance layer
  I want to connect with others who share my interests and experiences
  So that I can pursue passions, build friendships, and combat isolation

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elder user is registered in the system
    And the affinity_network governance context is active
    And Rose, age 73, seeks connection around her interests

  Scenario: Elder joins quilting affinity network
    Given Rose is a quilter interested in connecting with other quilters
    When she discovers a regional quilting network on Elohim
    And the network includes elders and younger crafters
    Then she can join and share her quilting patterns
    And she connects with others who appreciate traditional techniques
    And she mentors younger quilters learning the craft
    And her patterns are valued and spread through the network
    And she finds meaningful community around her lifelong passion

  Scenario: Elder protected from health fraud in wellness network
    Given Rose participates in a seniors wellness affinity network
    When a scammer tries to promote miracle cure products
    And they attempt to contact network members with fraudulent claims
    Then the guardian agent detects the scam pattern
    And the fraudulent messages are blocked before reaching Rose
    And legitimate health information continues to flow
    And wellness discussions remain safe and evidence-based
    And Rose and peers are protected while maintaining autonomy

  Scenario: Elder shares cultural knowledge across generations
    Given Rose is second-generation Italian American
    And she knows traditional recipes and cultural practices
    When she joins a cultural preservation affinity network
    And she documents her grandmother's recipes with stories
    Then her contributions reach others interested in Italian American heritage
    And younger generations learn traditional knowledge
    And her cultural memory is preserved for future generations
    And Rose experiences pride in cultural contribution
    And intergenerational cultural transmission succeeds

  Scenario: Elder finds peer support during life transition
    Given Rose is adjusting to widowhood after 50 years of marriage
    When she joins a grief support affinity network for widows/widowers
    And she shares her experience and struggles
    Then she connects with others navigating similar loss
    And peer support helps her process grief
    And she eventually mentors newly widowed community members
    And the network provides genuine emotional support
    And isolation during difficult transition is prevented
    And Rose finds path forward through community support
