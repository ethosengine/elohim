Scenario: Lifelong learning beyond formal education
    Given Kenji's learning will continue after graduation
    And education is lifelong process, not just college phase
    When the educational_elohim supports ongoing learning
    Then it should help Kenji develop self-directed learning capabilities
    And it should recognize informal learning as valuable as formal coursework
    And it should encourage learning from community, work, and life experience
    And lifelong learning should be valued as care economy participation
    And the system should support learning as continuous development
    And education should be understood as lifelong care economy investment
