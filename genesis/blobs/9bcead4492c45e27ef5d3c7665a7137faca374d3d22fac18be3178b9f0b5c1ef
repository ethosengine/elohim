Scenario: Safe environment for learning from mistakes
    Given Emma is practicing value literacy
    And mistakes are essential to learning
    When Emma makes a choice that doesn't work out well
    Then the experience should be treated as learning opportunity
    And her personal_agent should guide reflection: "How did that work out?"
    And no shame or punishment should be attached to mistakes
    And consequences should be educational, not harmful
    And judgment should be built through safe practice
    And error should be normalized as part of learning process
