Scenario: Research findings immediately improve local governance
    Given my research identified that Constitutional Council deliberations improve with certain information tools
    And I shared findings with Mayor Jamal and council members
    When community decides to implement recommended improvements
    Then research serves practical improvement not just academic knowledge
    And Rapid feedback loop connects insight to implementation
    And Community sees research benefiting them directly
    And Researcher-community trust strengthens through mutual value
    And Knowledge serves flourishing not just publication
    And Research demonstrates: scholarship in service of democracy
