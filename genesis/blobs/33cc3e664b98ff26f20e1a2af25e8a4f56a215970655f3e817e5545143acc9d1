Scenario: Teen builds peer networks for collective care economy
    Given Jasmine has friends and peers in the neighborhood
    And they are all learning care economy practices
    When Jasmine coordinates with peers for mutual support
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate peer-to-peer care
    And teens should be able to exchange care tokens without adult mediation
    And peer networks should operate horizontally as valid care economy
    And collective buying, skill sharing, and mutual aid should be supported
    And Jasmine should learn that care economy works at her generation's scale
    And peer care networks should build social capital and community resilience
