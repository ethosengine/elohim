Scenario: Family boundaries shape young child's scanner permissions
    Given Tommy's parents have set family values and boundaries
    And the family has budget constraints of $40k/year household income
    And Emma has a nut allergy
    And the family prioritizes nutritional guidelines
    When Tommy uses the Value Scanner
    Then his personal_agent should enforce family boundaries invisibly
    And budget-aware selections should be guided
    And allergen items should be blocked without Tommy's awareness
    And nutritionally appropriate options should be highlighted
    And Tommy should experience boundaries as care, not control
