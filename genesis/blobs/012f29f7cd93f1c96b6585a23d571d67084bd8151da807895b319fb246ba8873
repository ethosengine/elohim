Scenario: Appeal establishes novel constitutional precedent
    Given my case involves a situation not previously addressed
    And existing precedents don't clearly apply to my circumstances
    When Regional Constitutional Council deliberates my case
    Then they engage deeply with constitutional principles
    And They consider multiple interpretations and their implications
    And They consult technical experts about what's technically possible
    And They examine similar cases from other regions for comparison
    And They create new precedent with careful reasoning
    And The precedent becomes part of public constitutional record
    And Future similar cases reference my appeal's constitutional interpretation
