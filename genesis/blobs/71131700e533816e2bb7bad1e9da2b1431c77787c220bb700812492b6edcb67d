Scenario: Customer advocacy spreads democratic business model through community
    Given Ms. Johnson experiences benefits of democratic business personally
    And neighbors don't know democratic alternatives exist
    When satisfied customers share experiences and advocate for democratic businesses
    Then she tells neighbors about worker ownership and improved quality
    And brings isolated elders to senior meal program
    And word-of-mouth advocacy builds customer base for democratic businesses
    And community awareness of economic democracy grows through customer stories
    And community_elohim supports customer advocacy and community education
