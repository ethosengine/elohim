Scenario: Privacy rights preserved despite family care coordination needs
    Given Helen's family needs information for care coordination
    And Helen retains full personhood and privacy rights
    When Helen's care data is accessed
    Then Helen must maintain control over her own data
    And she must explicitly delegate any family access
    And default should preserve her privacy unless she chooses sharing
    And she is not someone to be managed without consent
    And safety needs do not automatically override privacy rights
    And the system must balance autonomy with necessary coordination
    And Helen remains a person with full rights, not a patient to be managed
