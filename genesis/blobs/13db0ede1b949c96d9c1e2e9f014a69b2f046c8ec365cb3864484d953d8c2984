Scenario: Managing household energy and time amid extreme depletion
    Given I am traumatized, stressed, and exhausted
    And household operations require consistent energy and attention
    When I allocate my limited capacity across household demands
    Then the Value Scanner helps me identify what's truly essential vs. what can wait
    And provides realistic expectations for what's achievable in my state
    And suggests efficiency strategies that reduce cognitive load
    And validates that "good enough" is genuinely good enough right now
    And helps me ask for and coordinate household help
    And my personal_agent prevents me from over-committing my depleted resources
    And recognizes that managing household while traumatized is extraordinary
    And celebrates my household care work under extreme constraint
