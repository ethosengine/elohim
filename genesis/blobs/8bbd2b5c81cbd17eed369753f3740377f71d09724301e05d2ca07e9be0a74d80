Scenario: Parental oversight protects young child while honoring agency
    Given Tommy has genuine autonomy in the scanner
    And he is only 5 years old
    When Tommy makes selections
    Then parental oversight should be supreme
    And Sarah should have full visibility into Tommy's scanner usage
    And Sarah should control what data is recorded
    And Tommy's agency should be preserved within parental boundaries
    And the balance should protect both safety and autonomy
    And Sarah should not experience anxiety about granting Tommy freedom
