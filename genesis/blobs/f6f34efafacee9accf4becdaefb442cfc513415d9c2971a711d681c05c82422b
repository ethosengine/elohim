Scenario: Participating in neighborhood decision-making and collective action
    Given my neighborhood faces issues that affect residents
    And I have stake in neighborhood decisions despite housing temporariness
    When neighborhood collective action or decision-making occurs
    Then the Value Scanner connects me to neighborhood organizing
    And validates my right to participate in neighborhood governance
    And helps me contribute despite time and energy constraints
    And facilitates my voice in decisions affecting my household
    And tracks neighborhood issues and actions
    And my personal_agent surfaces opportunities matching my capacity
    And recognizes community organizing as valuable civic labor
    And supports my participation as full neighborhood member
