Scenario: Gardening and local food production with grandchildren
    Given Margaret gardens and teaches grandchildren about growing food
    And they learn where food comes from and how to nurture plants
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food production activities
    Then it should recognize gardening as ecological care work
    And it should value teaching food production as essential education
    And it should track local food growing and knowledge transmission
    And gardening should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's teaching should support food sovereignty
    And intergenerational food knowledge should be preserved
