Scenario: Time management for competing demands
    Given Kenji must balance 15 hours work, full academic load, and household responsibilities
    And time is his most constrained resource
    When the personal_agent helps Kenji manage his schedule
    Then it should teach realistic time budgeting
    And it should help him prioritize among competing demands
    And it should recognize time spent on care work as real constraint
    And the agent should validate that he cannot do everything
    And it should help him make conscious trade-offs
    And Kenji should learn sustainable pacing for long-term success
