Scenario: Operator experiences moral liberation from implementing harmful policies
    Given franchise agreement required implementing corporate policies James knew harmed workers
    And moral injury from enforcing extraction while knowing it's wrong caused deep stress
    When conversion frees him from corporate mandates
    Then James no longer implements surveillance monitoring workers like criminals
    And he stops enforcing poverty wages and impossible productivity demands
    And stress from moral contradiction (knowing exploitation is wrong but implementing it) dissipates
    And his health improves measurably (lower blood pressure, better sleep, reduced anxiety)
    And workplace_elohim documents health benefits of liberation from moral injury
