Scenario: Community transportation support for medical appointments
    Given James must coordinate multiple medical appointments
    And transportation logistics are overwhelming
    When the community_elohim organizes transportation support
    Then volunteer drivers should be available for medical appointments
    And transportation should accommodate David's cognitive needs
    And scheduling should be reliable for multiple appointments
    And community should reduce transportation burden
    And medical access should not require James to manage everything alone
