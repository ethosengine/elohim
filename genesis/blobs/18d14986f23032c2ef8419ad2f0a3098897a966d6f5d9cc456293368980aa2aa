Scenario: Municipal food policy informed by teen participation patterns
    Given Jasmine uses Value Scanner for food purchasing across the municipality
    And aggregate data shows youth food access patterns
    When municipal_elohim analyzes food security and access
    Then it should surface insights about how teens access food
    And identify food deserts affecting youth
    And show impact of local food policy on teen nutrition
    And inform municipal food policy with data about youth participation
    And support evidence-based policy for food security
    And recognize that teen food access matters to public health
