Scenario: Crisis detection when Maria approaches physical or emotional breakdown
    Given Maria operates at unsustainable intensity with no backup
    And she cannot afford to collapse because there's no one else
    When the personal_agent monitors Maria's health and stress levels
    Then it should detect warning signs of approaching breakdown
    And it should alert Maria before crisis becomes emergency
    And it should proactively surface support options
    And it should connect her to emergency resources if needed
    And it should treat Maria's well-being as critical infrastructure for family survival
