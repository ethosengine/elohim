Scenario: Journalist tracks city promises to accountability
    Given city council approved affordable housing plan 3 years ago
    And the journalist covered initial announcement and then moved on
    When the Observer alerts on promise implementation timeline
    Then the journalist investigates and finds only 12% of promised units built
    And sees budget that was supposed to fund program redirected elsewhere
    And identifies which council members voted for budget changes
    And publishes accountability story on broken housing commitments
    And politicians learn promises will be tracked and verified
