Scenario: Connecting disability rights to environmental justice organizing
    Given both movements challenge systems that devalue certain lives
    And both require recognizing interdependence and collective care
    When Alex participates in environmental organizing
    Then the bioregional_elohim should facilitate cross-movement solidarity
    And it should help Alex build bridges between disability and environmental movements
    And it should make visible shared principles and goals
    And coalition-building should be supported and valued
    And Alex's work connecting movements should accumulate care tokens
    And the protocol should recognize that these justices are interconnected
    And Alex's bridge-building strengthens both movements
