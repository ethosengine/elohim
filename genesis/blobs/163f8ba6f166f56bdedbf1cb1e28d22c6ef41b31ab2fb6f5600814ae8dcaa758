Scenario: Teen's labor contribution valued at appropriate care economy rates
    Given Jasmine works 15 hours per week
    And her labor has real economic value
    When workplace_elohim calculates her care contributions
    Then it should value her work at care economy rates, not just market wages
    And recognize that her labor enables the business to function
    And track the full value she creates, not just what she's paid
    And help her understand the difference between value created and compensation received
    And build her critical awareness of labor economics
    And prepare her to advocate for fair value recognition
