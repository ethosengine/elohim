Scenario: Ecological care contributions recognized in care token economy
    Given Sarah makes environmentally conscious choices
    And ecological care is care work that benefits everyone
    When Sarah's care contributions are tracked
    Then environmental care choices should generate care tokens
    And Sarah should be recognized for ecological stewardship
    And care for planet should be valued alongside care for people
    And care tokens should incentivize environmental care
    And ecological care should be integrated into care economy
