Feature: Provincial/State-Level Policy Making for AI Governance
  As a policy_maker in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer
  I want to create enabling legislation for democratic AI governance
  So that protocol serves communities while integrating with existing law

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the policy_maker user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active
    And Senator Elena Ruiz chairs state AI governance committee

  Scenario: Crafting enabling legislation protecting protocol sovereignty
    Given I want to support democratic AI governance
    And I must integrate protocol with existing state law
    When I draft AI governance legislation
    Then I create: legal recognition of Constitutional Council authority
    And I establish: state funding for community protocol infrastructure
    And I mandate: interoperability between government systems and protocol
    And I protect: communities from corporate capture attempts
    And I ensure: equitable access for poor communities
    And my legislation: enables rather than controls protocol
    And I empower: community sovereignty within legal framework

  Scenario: Using research evidence to justify protocol support
    Given I need to defend protocol against skeptical colleagues
    And Dr. Chen's research provides rigorous evaluation
    When I cite evidence in committee hearings
    Then I present: data showing reduced loneliness and improved wellbeing
    And I provide: evidence about successful crisis response
    And I demonstrate: marginalized community access patterns
    And I show: comparison with communities without protocol
    And I address: limitations and challenges honestly
    And evidence base: supports informed policy choice
    And I maintain: scientific credibility through honest assessment

  Scenario: Hearing testimony from Mayor Jamal about implementation reality
    Given I need ground truth about protocol in practice
    And Riverside provides three years of experience
    When Mayor Jamal testifies about community implementation
    Then he shares: what works (community calibration, constitutional oversight)
    And he describes: what struggles (elderly accessibility, controversy)
    And he explains: factors predicting adoption success
    And he provides: evidence countering corporate lobbyist claims
    And his testimony: grounds policy in lived reality
    And I learn: from practitioners not just theory
    And community voices: inform state legislation

  Scenario: Resisting corporate lobbying for regulatory capture
    Given tech companies lobby for regulations favoring incumbents
    And they push: backdoor mandates, centralization requirements, licensing barriers
    When I defend protocol sovereignty against capture
    Then I use: cryptographic impossibility arguments (backdoors break verification)
    And I present: evidence that regulation would harm innovation
    And I coalition: with community leaders showing grassroots opposition
    And I reference: international examples of protocol sovereignty working
    And I require: transparency about lobbying and funding
    And I resist: well-funded pressure through political courage
    And I protect: democratic governance from corporate control

  Scenario: Establishing legal recognition of Constitutional Council decisions
    Given courts need to know how to treat council precedents
    And government agencies must understand council authority
    When I craft legislation recognizing council legitimacy
    Then I establish: statutory basis for council decisions
    And I specify: courts recognize precedents in protocol-related cases
    And I ensure: agencies defer to council constitutional interpretation
    And I maintain: judicial review for constitutional questions
    And I create: legal framework for sortition governance
    And councils gain: legitimacy within existing legal system
    And new democratic form: integrates with traditional structures

  Scenario: Funding state grants for community protocol adoption
    Given poor communities cannot afford protocol infrastructure
    And equitable access requires public investment
    When I secure state budget allocation for protocol support
    Then I fund: grants for community nodes and maintenance
    And I support: accessibility enhancements and education
    And I provide: technical assistance for implementation
    And I ensure: sliding scale and cross-subsidization
    And I treat: protocol as democracy infrastructure deserving investment
    And I prevent: digital divide excluding marginalized communities
    And public funding: enables universal access to democratic governance tools

  Scenario: Addressing protocol-tax law integration questions
    Given protocol creates novel economic relationships
    And tax implications are unclear
    When I work with revenue department on clarification
    Then we determine: tax treatment of care tokens
    And we address: property tax implications of resource sharing
    And we clarify: whether mutual aid counts for social safety net
    And we create: certainty enabling protocol to function
    And we avoid: creating impossible tax burdens
    And we ensure: tax policy doesn't undermine protocol benefits
    And legal clarity: supports implementation

  Scenario: Coordinating interstate recognition of protocol decisions
    Given protocol operates across state boundaries
    And consistency is needed for coordination
    When I work on interstate compact for protocol recognition
    Then we establish: mutual recognition of council decisions across states
    And we create: conflict resolution mechanisms for disputes
    And we maintain: state sovereignty and variation
    And we enable: coordination without centralization
    And we show: federalism working for AI governance
    And states cooperate: while preserving local autonomy

  Scenario: Responding to constituent concerns about AI governance
    Given residents contact me about protocol experiences
    And I am accountable through elections
    When I maintain constituent engagement on AI governance
    Then I hold: town halls in communities like Riverside
    And I offer: office hours for people like Marcus to share experiences
    And I conduct: surveys gathering feedback on legislation
    And I respond: to concerns showing I'm listening
    And I maintain: constituent services for protocol-related issues
    And I remain: democratically accountable for policy choices

  Scenario: Establishing liability framework for agent errors
    Given agents will make mistakes
    And someone must address harms
    When I create liability and accountability legislation
    Then I establish: protocol insurance pool for errors
    And I specify: remedies for different types of mistakes
    And I require: immediate correction and compensation
    And I penalize: bad-faith attempts to corrupt agents
    And I balance: accountability with innovation
    And framework: enables learning from mistakes
    And responsibility: is clear without stifling development

  Scenario: Mandating transparency while protecting privacy
    Given public needs visibility into protocol governance
    And individuals need privacy protection
    When I craft transparency requirements
    Then I require: appeal outcomes and patterns be public
    And I mandate: constitutional council precedents accessible
    And I ensure: individual data privacy through anonymization
    And I specify: security audit results must be disclosed
    And I balance: transparency serving accountability with privacy protection
    And requirements: enable democratic oversight without surveillance

  Scenario: Learning from protocol outcomes to improve legislation
    Given Constitutional Convention passed adolescent autonomy amendment
    And this reflects accumulated precedents and appeals
    When I translate constitutional evolution into state law
    Then I craft: legislation operationalizing the amendment
    And I update: state family law to reflect constitutional principle
    And I modify: education policy honoring developing autonomy
    And constitutional evolution: informs statutory law
    And I demonstrate: how different democratic forms work together
