Scenario: Grappling with superintelligence governance at convention
    Given agents are approaching human comprehension limits
    And we must decide how to govern what we barely understand
    When we deliberate on superintelligence constitutional framework
    Then Dr. Chen presents: research on sortition governance limitations
    And Dr. Okonkwo explains: what can and cannot be technically verified
    And we hear: diverse perspectives on trust and oversight
    And we confront: possibility democratic oversight might become theater
    And we grapple: with existential uncertainty about governance
    And we may establish: capability limits until problems are solved
    And we insist: on human dignity and democratic voice even in uncertainty
    And we demonstrate: humble wisdom in face of profound questions
