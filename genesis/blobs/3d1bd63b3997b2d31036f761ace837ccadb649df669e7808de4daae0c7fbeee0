Scenario: Politician evaluates climate adaptation investments with equity focus
    Given climate change requires infrastructure resilience investments
    And limited resources force priority-setting across neighborhoods
    When the Observer analyzes climate vulnerability and adaptation patterns
    Then they see flood risk concentrated in low-income neighborhoods
    And identify heat island effects in communities lacking tree canopy
    And understand which populations most vulnerable to climate impacts
    And ensure resilience investments prioritize environmental justice
    And allocate climate adaptation funding equitably
