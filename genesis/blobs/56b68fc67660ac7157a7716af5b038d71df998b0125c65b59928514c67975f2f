Feature: Individual Digital Sovereignty for Activist
  As an activist in the social_medium system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want to maintain my digital sovereignty and personal security
  So that I can organize for change without fear of surveillance or suppression

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the individual governance context is active
    And the activist has personal node with encrypted storage

  Scenario: Activist establishes protected digital identity
    Given the activist is setting up their personal node
    When they configure their activist identity with privacy controls
    And they designate trusted sanctuary institutions for backup
    And they enable multi-factor authentication with biometric verification
    Then their identity is cryptographically secured on their personal node
    And their data is encrypted end-to-end
    And sanctuary protocols are established with designated institutions
    And the system confirms digital sovereignty is established

  Scenario: Activist detects surveillance attempt and activates sanctuary
    Given the activist is organizing a climate justice campaign
    And they have shared organizing documents with their local group
    When the system detects repeated unauthorized access attempts to their node
    And the protection agent identifies a pattern indicating state surveillance
    Then the activist receives immediate alert with threat assessment
    And sanctuary protocol options are presented
    And the activist can choose to fragment data across sanctuary institutions
    And organizing continues through secure channels
    And the community is alerted to heightened security measures

  Scenario: Activist manages multiple digital identities safely
    Given the activist works on both local neighborhood issues and sensitive human rights cases
    When they create separate personas for different organizing contexts
    Then each persona has independent privacy settings
    And connections between personas are cryptographically isolated
    And the activist can switch contexts without cross-contamination
    And each persona's contributions earn reach independently
    And protection protocols apply to all personas

  Scenario: Activist recovers data after device seizure
    Given the activist's device was confiscated during a protest
    And their data was pre-distributed to sanctuary institutions
    When the activist obtains new hardware and initiates recovery
    And they authenticate through biometric and social verification
    And the sanctuary institutions verify the activist's safety and free will
    Then all organizing data, contacts, and history are restored
    And the compromised device's access is permanently revoked
    And the activist resumes organizing with full digital sovereignty
    And the network logs the rights violation for documentation
