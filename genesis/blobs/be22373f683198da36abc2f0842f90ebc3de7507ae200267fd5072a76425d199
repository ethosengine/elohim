Scenario: Senior employment and income supplementation programs
    Given Margaret's fixed income is limited
    And some seniors want/need supplemental income
    When the municipality_elohim provides employment information
    Then senior-appropriate employment opportunities should be available
    And part-time work that doesn't jeopardize benefits should be possible
    And income supplementation programs should be accessible
    And Margaret should have options to increase resources if she chooses
    And employment should be optional, not mandatory for survival
    And municipal programs should support senior economic security
