Scenario: Local board member identifies when community issues require higher-level action
    Given neighborhood board addresses various community concerns
    And some issues are within board authority while others require city or district action
    And board wants to be effective by focusing advocacy appropriately
    When the board member uses Observer governance layer analysis
    Then they see which issues are addressable at community level
    And identify which concerns require municipality or district decisions
    And access guidance on advocacy strategies for different governance levels
    And connect to relevant board members at higher governance layers
    And clear governance mapping makes advocacy more strategic and effective
