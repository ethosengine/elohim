Scenario: Neighborhood youth gain employment pathways with dignity and ownership potential
    Given franchise locations offered poverty-wage jobs with no advancement or ownership
    And youth employment was exploitative, not developmental
    When democratic governance creates dignified youth employment programs
    Then neighborhood youth earn living wages ($18/hour) with training and support
    And employment includes path to worker ownership for committed participants
    And youth experience democratic governance, not hierarchical exploitation
    And community youth economic opportunity improves dramatically through local democratic businesses
    And community_elohim documents youth employment outcomes and advancement pathways
