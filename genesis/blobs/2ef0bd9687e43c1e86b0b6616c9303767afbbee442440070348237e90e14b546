Scenario: Politician surfaces constituent environmental priorities beyond loudest voices
    Given the politician hears from passionate environmental activists
    But uncertain whether priorities reflect broader community
    When the Observer aggregates constituent environmental sentiment
    Then they see working families prioritize air quality and park access
    And learn parents care about safe outdoor spaces for children
    And identify senior concerns about extreme heat vulnerability
    And understand environmental priorities across diverse constituents
    And align policy with community environmental needs
