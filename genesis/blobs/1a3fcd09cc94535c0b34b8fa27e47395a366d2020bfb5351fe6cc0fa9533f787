Scenario: Neighborhood youth gain apprenticeship and ownership pathways
    Given community lacks skilled trades training and economic opportunity for youth
    And Rosa's expertise could benefit next generation but individual ownership prevents scaling
    When democratic governance creates youth apprenticeship program
    Then neighborhood youth learn auto repair skills with paid training
    And apprentices can become worker-owners after demonstrating competency
    And economic opportunity stays in community, not extracting to corporate chains
    And intergenerational knowledge transfer strengthens community resilience
    And community_elohim documents youth pathways from apprenticeship to ownership
