Scenario: Practices of frugality and resource conservation
    Given Margaret's generation learned to waste nothing and maximize resources
    And these practices are essential for ecological sustainability
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks resource conservation
    Then it should recognize Margaret's frugal practices as ecological wisdom
    And it should value conservation skills and waste reduction
    And it should track resource efficiency and reuse practices
    And frugality should be reframed as environmental stewardship
    And Margaret's practices should be recognized as climate action
    And traditional conservation knowledge should be valued and transmitted
