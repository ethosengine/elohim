Scenario: Building neighborhood relationships across demographic differences
    Given Kenji's neighborhood includes diverse ages, incomes, and backgrounds
    And care economy requires bridging difference
    When Kenji builds relationships with non-student neighbors
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize cross-demographic care work
    And it should value relationships with elderly neighbors, families, workers
    And it should show how diverse relationships strengthen neighborhood
    And bridging work should be recognized as care contribution
    And the system should foster inclusive neighborhood community
    And students should learn to build community across difference
