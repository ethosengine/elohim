Scenario: Organizer coordinates parent-teacher coalition for class size reduction
    Given teachers union supports smaller class sizes
    And parents see crowded classrooms affecting their children
    When the organizer builds coalition using Observer coordination tools
    Then teachers and parents access shared data on class size impacts
    And coordinate testimony combining professional and family perspectives
    And track which board members support class size reduction
    And organize joint mobilization for board meeting
    And teacher expertise combines with parent power for policy change
