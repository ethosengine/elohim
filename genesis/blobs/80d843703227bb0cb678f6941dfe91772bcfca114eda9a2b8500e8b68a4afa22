Scenario: Participating in bioregional food systems
    Given bioregional food systems reduce environmental impact
    And Aisha could access local food networks
    When the bioregional_elohim surfaces opportunities
    Then it should connect her to farmers markets, CSAs, or food hubs
    And it should explain benefits of bioregional food systems
    And it should help her participate within budget constraints
    And local food networks should be accessible and affordable
    And bioregional participation should support environmental sustainability
