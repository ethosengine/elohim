Scenario: Teacher challenges administrator retaliation safely
    Given a principal retaliates against teachers who question decisions
    And individual teachers fear speaking up
    When teachers report concerns anonymously through Observer
    Then patterns of retaliation become visible (negative evaluations after dissent)
    And aggregated evidence protects individual teachers
    And union files grievance based on documented pattern
    And district addresses hostile administrator behavior
    And anonymous reporting enables accountability without individual risk
