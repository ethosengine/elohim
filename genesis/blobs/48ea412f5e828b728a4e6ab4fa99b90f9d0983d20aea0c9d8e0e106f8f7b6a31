Scenario: Investor participates in bioregional ecological governance
    Given bioregional ecosystems need coordinated stewardship beyond market forces
    And Patricia wants ecological voice in investment governance
    When bioregional democratic economy includes ecological representation
    Then watershed councils, indigenous nations, and ecological scientists participate in investment governance
    And investment decisions consider ecological health alongside economic returns
    And bioregional governance protects ecosystems through democratic accountability
    And ecological limits are respected in economic planning
    And bioregional_elohim facilitates ecological governance participation
