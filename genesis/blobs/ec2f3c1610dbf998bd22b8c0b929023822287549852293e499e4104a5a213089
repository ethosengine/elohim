Scenario: Family privacy boundaries negotiated across generations
    Given family coordination requires information sharing
    And family members have legitimate need for privacy
    And Robert manages sensitive information about parents and children
    When family_elohim manages privacy
    Then it should enable coordination while protecting privacy
    And Robert should control what information he shares about his household
    And parents should maintain privacy about their health and finances
    And adult children should control their own information sharing
    And siblings should have access to parent care information
    And family care coordination should not violate individual privacy
    And privacy boundaries should be negotiable and respectful
