Scenario: Franchise extraction to distant shareholders is replaced by local wealth circulation
    Given franchise locations extracted $120K annually to corporate (fees and markups across three locations)
    And profits beyond operator's modest take also left community
    When conversion eliminates corporate extraction and distributes value locally
    Then $120K annually circulates in neighborhood economies instead of extracting
    And workers earning higher wages spend locally, multiplying community benefit
    And community programs receive funding from value previously extracted
    And wealth circulation is documented showing dramatic shift from extraction to community benefit
