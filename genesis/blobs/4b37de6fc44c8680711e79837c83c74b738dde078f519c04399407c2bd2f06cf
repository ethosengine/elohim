Scenario: Owner protects workers while achieving own security
    Given Rosa could sell to buyer who would fire workers and cut quality
    And she refuses to betray workers despite financial pressure
    When EAE acquisition enables both worker protection and owner security
    Then workers gain ownership, higher wages, and governance voice
    And Rosa achieves financial security without worker exploitation
    And false choice between owner security and worker dignity is resolved
    And Rosa's ethical commitments are honored, not punished
