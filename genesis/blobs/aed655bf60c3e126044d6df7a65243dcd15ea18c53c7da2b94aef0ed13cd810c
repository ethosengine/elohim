Scenario: Reviewing systematic bias revealed across community appeals
    Given researcher identified pattern of biased agent decisions
    And multiple similar appeals came from affected communities
    When we treat this as systemic review not individual cases
    Then we investigate: if protocol implementation has regional problems
    And we examine: if certain demographics are disadvantaged
    And we consult: researchers on the pattern data
    And we may order: regional protocol audit or recalibration
    And we address: structural injustice not just individual grievances
    And we demonstrate: constitutional accountability works at scale
    And we prevent: systemic violations through democratic oversight
