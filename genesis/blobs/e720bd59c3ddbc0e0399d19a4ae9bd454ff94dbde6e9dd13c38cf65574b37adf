Scenario: Establishing legal recognition of Constitutional Council decisions
    Given courts need to know how to treat council precedents
    And government agencies must understand council authority
    When I craft legislation recognizing council legitimacy
    Then I establish: statutory basis for council decisions
    And I specify: courts recognize precedents in protocol-related cases
    And I ensure: agencies defer to council constitutional interpretation
    And I maintain: judicial review for constitutional questions
    And I create: legal framework for sortition governance
    And councils gain: legitimacy within existing legal system
    And new democratic form: integrates with traditional structures
