Scenario: Community policy advocacy based on caregiver data
    Given caregivers need employment protections and support policies
    And policy requires data to demonstrate need
    When the community_elohim aggregates caregiver data
    Then it should demonstrate caregiving scope in community
    And data should support advocacy for caregiver leave policies
    And it should show economic impact of unsupported caregiving
    And community should advocate for caregivers at policy level
    And care economy data should drive systemic change
