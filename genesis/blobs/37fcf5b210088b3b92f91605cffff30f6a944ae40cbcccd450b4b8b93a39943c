Scenario: Community care networks provide emergency backup
    Given Marcus's household operates on thin margins
    And emergencies could overwhelm family capacity
    When crisis situations arise
    Then the community_elohim should activate emergency support
    And community care networks should provide rapid assistance
    And Marcus's family should receive help through established relationships
    And emergency support should flow through care economy channels
    And crisis intervention should prevent family breakdown
    And community should function as safety net for vulnerable families
