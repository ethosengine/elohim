Scenario: Managing professional identity alongside parent identity
    Given Sarah is both teacher and mother
    And these identities sometimes conflict or compete
    When Sarah navigates professional and parenting identities
    Then the personal_agent should help her integrate both roles
    And it should recognize she is complete person with multiple identities
    And it should support her wholeness across contexts
    And the system should help her maintain both professional and parent identity
    And neither role should consume total identity
    And Sarah should be supported in being both teacher and mother
