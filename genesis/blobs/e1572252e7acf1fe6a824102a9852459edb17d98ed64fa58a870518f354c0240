Scenario: Supporting neighborhood care infrastructure
    Given neighborhood has community spaces, gardens, or shared resources
    When I have time to contribute to maintaining shared infrastructure
    Then the protocol should recognize this as care contribution
    And coordinate volunteer opportunities that fit my schedule
    And accumulate care tokens for infrastructure support
    And help build neighborhood commons that benefit all residents
