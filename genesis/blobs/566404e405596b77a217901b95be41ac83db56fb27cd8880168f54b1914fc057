Scenario: Personal agent preserves Margaret's identity beyond grandparenting
    Given Margaret has her own interests, friendships, and development goals
    And she is not defined solely by caregiving roles
    When Margaret's personal_agent tracks her activities
    Then it should recognize time spent on her own hobbies and interests
    And it should encourage balance between caregiving and personal growth
    And it should protect space for Margaret's continued development
    And it should affirm that her value extends beyond utility
    And Margaret should experience herself as a whole person
    And the system should prevent her identity collapse into "just grandma"
    And her autonomy and personhood should be continuously affirmed
