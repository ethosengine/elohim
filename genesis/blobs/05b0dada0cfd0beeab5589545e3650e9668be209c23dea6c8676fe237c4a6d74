Scenario: Accessing educational support services for children experiencing trauma
    Given my children are exhibiting trauma responses affecting learning
    And schools have support services (counseling, IEPs, 504 plans, trauma-informed support)
    When I advocate for educational support for my children
    Then the Value Scanner helps me identify appropriate educational interventions
    And provides information about my children's rights to services
    And helps me navigate IEP or 504 plan processes
    And coordinates with school counselors and support staff
    And tracks children's educational support needs and services received
    And my personal_agent reminds me of educational meetings and deadlines
    And recognizes educational advocacy as sophisticated parenting work
    And validates that trauma affects learning and requires support
