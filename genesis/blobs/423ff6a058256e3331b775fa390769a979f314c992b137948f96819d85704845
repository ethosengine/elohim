Scenario: Citizen tracks accountability for neighborhood commitments
    Given the community council promised playground repairs in 60 days
    And the commitment was made during a public meeting
    When 60 days pass
    Then the Observer alerts the citizen about the deadline
    And tracks whether repairs were completed
    And provides evidence for accountability conversations
    And prevents institutional forgetting of commitments
    And democracy includes follow-through tracking
