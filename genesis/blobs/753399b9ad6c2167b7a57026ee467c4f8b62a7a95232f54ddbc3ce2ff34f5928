Scenario: Cross-cultural constitutional interpretation
    Given appeals from collectivist and individualist cultures
    And one culture views family intervention as natural care
    And another culture views same intervention as autonomy violation
    When global council interprets universal constitutional minimums
    Then the council distinguishes coercion from cultural difference
    And the council establishes that genuine consent within cultural context suffices
    And the council prohibits force but doesn't mandate individualism
    And appellants from both cultures feel heard
    And constitutional pluralism is preserved within universal boundaries
