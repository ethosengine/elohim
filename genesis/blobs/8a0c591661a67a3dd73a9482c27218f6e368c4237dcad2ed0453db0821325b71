Scenario: Teacher reveals disparate working conditions
    Given some teachers have adequate planning time while others don't
    And resource distribution within school is inequitable
    When the Observer documents working conditions by department
    Then disparities become visible (English: 45min planning, Math: 90min)
    And teachers identify structural causes vs individual complaints
    And principal sees evidence requiring fair scheduling
    And working conditions equity improves school-wide
    And transparency drives fairness
