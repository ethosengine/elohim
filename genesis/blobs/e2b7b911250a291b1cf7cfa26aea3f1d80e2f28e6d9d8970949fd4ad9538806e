Scenario: Teen accesses community resources based on care contributions
    Given Jasmine has accumulated significant care tokens
    And the community offers educational programs and skill-building workshops
    When Jasmine seeks to access community opportunities
    Then her care contributions should qualify her for access
    And she should not need parent mediation to access community resources
    And the community_elohim should recognize her as an independent participant
    And opportunities should be surfaced based on her interests and contribution patterns
    And she should experience that care economy operates on reciprocity
    And her care tokens should give her legitimate standing to access community resources
