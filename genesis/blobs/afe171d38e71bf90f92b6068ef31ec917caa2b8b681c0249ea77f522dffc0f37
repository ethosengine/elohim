Scenario: Activist builds cross-border solidarity network
    Given labor activists in 15 countries face similar corporate exploitation
    And they want to coordinate against multinational corporation practices
    When they form a global labor solidarity network
    And they establish protocols respecting different legal contexts
    And translation agents enable communication across 12 languages
    Then the global network creates shared understanding of corporate tactics
    And each national group maintains autonomy over local strategy
    And pattern recognition surfaces successful resistance campaigns
    And coordination happens through verified trust relationships
    And legal risks are minimized through jurisdictional awareness
