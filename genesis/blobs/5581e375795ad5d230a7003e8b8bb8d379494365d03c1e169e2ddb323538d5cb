Scenario: Collective advocacy for student needs and rights
    Given students face systemic challenges (inadequate financial aid, housing costs, food insecurity)
    And collective action can create change
    When Kenji participates in student organizing
    Then the community_elohim should recognize advocacy as care contribution
    And it should value organizing work, protest participation, and policy advocacy
    And it should accumulate care tokens for working toward collective flourishing
    And advocacy labor should be recognized as community care work
    And the system should support student collective action
    And organizing for justice should be valued as care economy participation
