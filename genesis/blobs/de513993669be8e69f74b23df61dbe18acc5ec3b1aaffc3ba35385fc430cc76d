Scenario: Flexible scheduling accommodates medical appointments and fatigue
    Given Alex has medical appointments and disability-related health needs
    And fatigue is a real factor in Alex's work capacity
    When Alex manages work schedule
    Then the workplace_elohim should help negotiate flexible scheduling
    And it should track accommodation requests for schedule flexibility
    And Alex should be able to adjust hours around medical needs
    And part-time status should be respected as appropriate for Alex's capacity
    And the protocol should support Alex in managing work-life balance
    And flexible scheduling should be framed as reasonable accommodation
    And Alex's productivity should be measured appropriately for part-time work
