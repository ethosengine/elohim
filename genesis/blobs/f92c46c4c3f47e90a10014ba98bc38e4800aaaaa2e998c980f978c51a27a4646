Scenario: Community celebrates conversion success as neighborhood economic development
    Given economic development announcements typically celebrate corporate recruitment
    And franchise conversions deserve equal celebration as community wealth-building
    When conversions demonstrate success through measurable community benefits
    Then neighborhood organizations and local media celebrate democratic ownership
    And community events honor workers' ownership and James's conversion choice
    And public celebration builds awareness and political support for democratic economy
    And success story encourages other franchise operators and business owners to consider conversion
    And community_elohim coordinates celebration events amplifying democratic economy visibility
