Scenario: Creator covers local civic issue with evidence-based reporting
    Given the city council is voting on a controversial development
    When Sam creates content investigating the proposal's impacts
    And includes verified facts, stakeholder interviews, and documentation
    Then the verification agent validates factual claims
    And the content reaches community members affected by the decision
    And evidence-based reporting earns trust and wider reach
    And community makes better-informed decision
    And Sam builds reputation for quality local journalism
