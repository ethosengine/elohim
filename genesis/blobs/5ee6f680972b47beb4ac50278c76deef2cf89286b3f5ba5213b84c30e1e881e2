Scenario: Foundation for lifetime care economy thinking established
    Given Emma is forming foundational economic beliefs ages 8-10
    And early patterns shape lifelong thinking
    When Emma consistently makes care-based value decisions
    Then she should internalize resources are for stewardship
    And she should learn choices affect others' flourishing
    And she should understand care creates value
    And neural pathways for care economy should form
    And she should have alternative to consumer capitalism as baseline
    And this generation should grow up assuming care economy is normal
