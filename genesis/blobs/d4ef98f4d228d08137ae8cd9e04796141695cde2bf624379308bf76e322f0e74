Scenario: Community investment measures success through bioregional flourishing indicators
    Given traditional investment measures only financial returns
    And Patricia wants holistic measurement of investment impacts
    When bioregional investment develops comprehensive success metrics
    Then returns are measured as: financial (5% annually), ecological (carbon sequestered, biodiversity supported)
    And social indicators (living wages, democratic governance, community wellbeing)
    And bioregional health (watershed quality, soil carbon, ecosystem resilience)
    And investment success is holistic bioregional flourishing, not just profit
    And bioregional_elohim provides comprehensive impact measurement framework
