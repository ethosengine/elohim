Scenario: Seasonal bioregional coordination provides year-round local food supply
    Given individual farms have limited seasonal production windows
    And year-round local food requires bioregional coordination across climate zones
    When democratic farms coordinate seasonal production bioregionally
    Then farms in different microclimates provide sequential seasonal supply
    And storage and preservation extend local food availability
    And bioregional network reduces dependence on distant, fossil-fuel-intensive supply chains
    And food miles decrease dramatically through bioregional coordination
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates seasonal planning and distribution logistics
