Scenario: Roommate coordination for shared meals vs individual cooking
    Given some meals are shared and some are individual
    And coordination requires planning around different schedules
    When the household_elohim manages meal coordination
    Then it should track who's eating shared meals vs cooking separately
    And it should help schedule shared dinners when roommates are available
    And it should recognize Kenji's labor preparing shared meals
    And it should calculate fair cost sharing for shared food
    And the system should make coordination easy rather than burdensome
    And shared meals should build household community
