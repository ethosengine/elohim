Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Senior
  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to contribute to neighborhood care economy and build local social capital
  So that neighborhood resilience is strengthened and my future aging is supported

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the senior user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret actively participates in neighborhood care economy
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care patterns
    And Margaret has time and presence that working-age neighbors lack

  Scenario: Neighborhood presence and availability as care contribution
    Given Margaret is present in the neighborhood during working hours
    And she can respond to neighborhood needs in real-time
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks presence-based care
    Then Margaret's availability should be recognized as valuable
    And her ability to receive packages for working neighbors should be tracked
    And her presence during emergencies should be valued
    And the care contribution of simply being present should be visible
    And neighborhood benefits from retiree presence should be quantified
    And Margaret should understand her availability has real value

  Scenario: Participating in neighborhood mutual aid networks
    Given Margaret has time, skills, and motivation to help neighbors
    And she also has needs that neighbors can help with
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates mutual aid
    Then Margaret should be connected to reciprocal care networks
    And her contributions (childcare help, elder checking, skills) should be tracked
    And support she receives (technology help, heavy lifting, transportation) should be tracked
    And the framing should be mutual aid, not charity in either direction
    And Margaret both gives and receives in neighborhood care economy
    And dignity should be preserved through reciprocity framework

  Scenario: Building social capital for future care needs
    Given Margaret is relatively healthy and capable now
    And she will need more support as she ages
    When Margaret makes neighborhood care contributions
    Then she should be building relationships for her future
    And social capital should accumulate through current contributions
    And neighbors should develop sense of connection and reciprocity
    And Margaret's future care needs will be met by strong relationships
    And she's investing in the community that will care for her
    And strategic relationship-building for aging should be supported

  Scenario: Neighborhood food cooperative participation on fixed income
    Given Margaret's $150/week budget could benefit from bulk buying
    And neighbors face similar budget constraints
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies food cooperative opportunities
    Then Margaret should be connected to bulk buying networks
    And her participation should reduce her grocery costs
    And she should contribute her time and organizational skills
    And the cooperative should reduce individual household scarcity
    And neighborhood coordination should make fixed incomes stretch further
    And collective action should create better outcomes than individual effort

  Scenario: Knowing and watching out for neighborhood children
    Given Margaret is present when children are coming home from school
    And she has time to notice and care about local kids
    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates informal child watching
    Then Margaret's presence should contribute to neighborhood safety
    And parents should understand seniors provide informal oversight
    And Margaret's care about local children should be recognized
    And village-scale child protection should be facilitated
    And intergenerational neighborhood care should be normalized
    And working parents should benefit from retiree presence

  Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces household costs
    Given Margaret has tools, skills, and time
    And she has limited budget for purchasing services
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates resource sharing
    Then Margaret should share tools she owns but neighbors need
    And she should borrow tools she needs occasionally
    And skill sharing should reduce need for paid services
    And neighborhood tool library should benefit all members
    And Margaret's resources should be accessible to community
    And she should access neighbors' resources when needed

  Scenario: Senior knowledge of neighborhood history and patterns
    Given Margaret has lived in the neighborhood for years/decades
    And she has institutional knowledge about local patterns
    When neighborhood decisions are being made
    Then Margaret's knowledge should inform decision-making
    And her historical perspective should be valued
    And she should have standing in neighborhood governance
    And long-term residents' wisdom should shape neighborhood future
    And Margaret's experience should be treated as valuable resource
    And neighborhood planning should benefit from senior knowledge

  Scenario: Informal elder checking and support network
    Given multiple seniors live in the neighborhood
    And Margaret is in the "younger" senior cohort
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates elder support
    Then Margaret should help check on older neighbors
    And she should receive checking from younger neighbors
    And gradual transitions in care needs should be supported
    And no senior should be isolated or unseen
    And neighborhood should notice if something is wrong
    And informal care networks should prevent crisis

  Scenario: Neighborhood bulk shopping coordination
    Given Margaret shops regularly at local stores
    And bulk buying could reduce costs for multiple households
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates shopping
    Then Margaret should be connected to shopping cooperatives
    And she could coordinate bulk purchases given her time availability
    And multiple households should split bulk quantities
    And Margaret's organizational labor should be recognized
    And cost savings should benefit all participating households
    And her time availability should serve neighborhood benefit

  Scenario: Maintaining neighborhood relationships across class differences
    Given Margaret has limited income but middle-class background
    And the neighborhood may have economic diversity
    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates connections
    Then Margaret should be connected across economic boundaries
    And her value should not depend on financial resources
    And care contributions should create cross-class solidarity
    And the neighborhood should value all members' contributions
    And economic diversity should strengthen rather than divide
    And Margaret's care economy participation should bridge differences

  Scenario: Neighborhood emergency response and resilience
    Given Margaret is often home during the day
    And she has nursing background and crisis response experience
    When neighborhood emergencies occur
    Then Margaret should be part of emergency response network
    And her skills and availability should be known to neighbors
    And the neighborhood should be more resilient due to her presence
    And her contributions to collective safety should be tracked
    And emergency preparedness should be enhanced by retiree participation
    And Margaret's professional background should serve neighborhood

  Scenario: Privacy maintained while participating in neighborhood networks
    Given Margaret's financial situation is sensitive
    And neighborhood participation requires some visibility
    When Margaret's data contributes to neighborhood coordination
    Then her specific circumstances must remain private
    And only aggregated anonymized data should be shared
    And she should receive benefits without stigmatizing exposure
    And dignity should be preserved in all interactions
    And privacy should be balanced with community participation
    And the protocol should enable solidarity without surveillance
