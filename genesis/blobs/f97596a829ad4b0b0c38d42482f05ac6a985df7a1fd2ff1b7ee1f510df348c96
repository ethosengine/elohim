Scenario: Farmworker voice prevents owner burnout and distributes responsibility
    Given Tom carried full farm responsibility alone causing stress and burnout
    And sole proprietorship meant he couldn't take breaks without farm crisis
    When democratic governance distributes responsibility across worker-owners
    Then Tom (if staying as cooperative member) is freed from sole responsibility burden
    And farmworkers collectively manage farm reducing individual stress
    And vacation and health breaks become possible for all including Tom
    And democratic distribution of responsibility enables sustainable work-life balance
    And workplace_elohim ensures responsibility distribution is equitable and sustainable
