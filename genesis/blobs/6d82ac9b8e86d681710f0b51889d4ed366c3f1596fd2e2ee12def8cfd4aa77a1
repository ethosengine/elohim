Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent
  As a grandparent coordinating care work within my household
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want fair distribution of grandparenting labor and household impact
  So that care for grandchildren enhances rather than strains our household

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the grandparent user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret is married to "Robert" who is also retired
    And they share a household with joint resources and decisions
    And Margaret provides 25 hours/week grandchild care
    And Robert has his own retirement activities and interests
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim coordinates care work distribution

  Scenario: Distributing grandparenting labor equitably between partners
    Given both Margaret and Robert are retired and available
    And Margaret currently does most of the grandchild care
    When the household_elohim tracks care contributions
    Then it should show Margaret's 25 hours/week of grandchild care
    And it should show Robert's care contributions (if any)
    And it should identify if care labor is unequally distributed
    And it should facilitate discussion about equitable distribution
    And both partners should contribute to grandparenting
    And Margaret should not bear sole burden of care work
    And household care economy should be equitable

  Scenario: Coordinating household schedule around grandparenting commitments
    Given Margaret provides childcare three days per week
    And this affects household availability and flexibility
    When the household plans activities and commitments
    Then the household_elohim should coordinate around care schedule
    And it should recognize grandparenting as household commitment
    And it should help both partners plan around care days
    And household decisions should account for care obligations
    And Margaret's care work should be treated as serious commitment
    And the household should operate as team around grandparenting

  Scenario: Household resource allocation for grandparenting expenses
    Given grandparenting involves costs (activities, supplies, treats, transportation)
    And Margaret and Robert share household finances
    When the household budgets for grandparenting expenses
    Then the household_elohim should track all grandparenting costs
    And it should help budget for these as household expenses
    And it should distinguish between household costs and reimbursable family costs
    And both partners should agree on grandparenting spending
    And household resources should support care provision without strain
    And financial planning should include grandparenting expenses

  Scenario: Maintaining household identity and couple time amid care work
    Given Margaret and Robert are navigating retirement together
    And they have their own relationship and household life
    When Margaret provides substantial grandchild care
    Then the household_elohim should protect couple time
    And it should ensure grandparenting doesn't consume all household capacity
    And it should help maintain balance between care and relationship
    And Margaret and Robert should have time as a couple
    And household identity should extend beyond grandparenting
    And the system should support healthy household boundaries

  Scenario: Household space and logistics for grandchild care
    Given Margaret cares for grandchildren in their household
    And this requires child-friendly space and supplies
    When the household_elohim tracks space usage
    Then it should recognize household space devoted to grandchild care
    And it should help maintain appropriate supplies (toys, books, safety items)
    And it should coordinate space needs with household preferences
    And both partners should agree on household modifications for care
    And home should serve both grandparenting and household needs
    And space allocation should be mutually agreed

  Scenario: Impact of care work on household energy and capacity
    Given Margaret is 68 and active grandchild care is physically demanding
    And 25 hours/week of childcare affects household energy
    When the household_elohim monitors capacity
    Then it should track if care work is affecting Margaret's well-being
    And it should recognize when care burden is too high
    And it should help household discuss sustainable care levels
    And Robert should understand and support Margaret's capacity
    And household should be able to negotiate care boundaries with family
    And both partners' well-being should be protected

  Scenario: Household decision-making about grandparenting commitments
    Given grandparenting commitments affect both household members
    And decisions should be made jointly
    When the family requests additional care or changes
    Then the household_elohim should facilitate joint decision-making
    And both Margaret and Robert should agree on care commitments
    And household should speak with one voice to family
    And care arrangements should serve household needs and capacity
    And neither partner should unilaterally commit to care
    And household governance should be respected by extended family

  Scenario: Reciprocal care between Margaret and Robert as they age
    Given Margaret and Robert are both aging
    And they will increasingly need to care for each other
    When the household_elohim tracks household care patterns
    Then it should recognize reciprocal care between partners
    And it should show how they support each other's well-being
    And it should value care they provide to each other
    And household care economy should include partner care
    And both should accumulate care tokens for caring for each other
    And the system should support their aging together with dignity

  Scenario: Household participation in multigenerational care coordination
    Given Margaret provides care both to grandchildren and her elderly mother
    And Robert provides support to his own aging family
    When the household coordinates all care obligations
    Then the household_elohim should track all family care commitments
    And it should help balance multiple care responsibilities
    And it should prevent household care burden from becoming excessive
    And both partners should understand total household care load
    And household should be able to set sustainable boundaries
    And care obligations should be manageable and sustainable

  Scenario: Household transportation logistics for care provision
    Given Margaret transports grandchildren to activities and appointments
    And this uses household vehicle and resources
    When the household_elohim tracks transportation
    Then it should recognize transportation as care work
    And it should track vehicle use, gas costs, wear and tear
    And it should coordinate transportation between partners
    And it should help determine when family should reimburse costs
    And household transportation resources should be managed fairly
    And both partners should share transportation care labor

  Scenario: Retirement planning affected by grandparenting commitments
    Given Margaret and Robert had retirement plans and dreams
    And substantial grandparenting changes household capacity for travel and activities
    When the household plans retirement lifestyle
    Then the household_elohim should help balance care and retirement goals
    And it should ensure grandparenting doesn't entirely subsume retirement plans
    And it should help negotiate sustainable care arrangements
    And both partners should be able to enjoy retirement
    And household should maintain autonomy over retirement choices
    And grandparenting should enhance rather than replace retirement

  Scenario: Household health management while providing care
    Given both Margaret and Robert have health considerations
    And Margaret's care work requires physical and mental energy
    When the household_elohim monitors health impacts
    Then it should track whether care work affects Margaret's health
    And it should ensure both partners maintain health appointments and self-care
    And it should alert if care burden is compromising well-being
    And household health should be prioritized alongside care provision
    And both partners should support each other's health management
    And the system should enable sustainable care without health sacrifice
