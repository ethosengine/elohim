Scenario: Supporting adult children through financial constraints
    Given Margaret has very limited resources herself
    And her adult children sometimes face financial challenges
    When Margaret provides non-financial support
    Then her care contributions should be recognized as valuable
    And the family_elohim should show how her labor saves money
    And childcare provided prevents need for paid care
    And her contributions have real economic impact
    And Margaret's value to family doesn't require financial resources
    And care economy should be visible alongside financial economy
