Scenario: Understanding workplace rights and protections as vulnerable worker
    Given I may face workplace discrimination, harassment, or rights violations
    And vulnerable workers are often targeted for workplace abuse
    When I encounter workplace problems or need to understand my rights
    Then the workplace_elohim provides information on my workplace rights
    And helps me identify illegal workplace practices
    And connects me to legal resources or worker advocacy organizations
    And validates that I deserve workplace protection and dignity
    And helps me document workplace problems
    And my personal_agent alerts me to rights violations
    And recognizes that vulnerable workers need extra rights awareness
    And supports me in demanding legal workplace treatment
