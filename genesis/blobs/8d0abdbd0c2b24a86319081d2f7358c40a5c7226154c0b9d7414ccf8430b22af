Scenario: Displaced community coordinates managed retreat
    Given the coastal community is planning managed retreat over 10 years
    When the community uses Elohim to coordinate the transition
    And they make collective decisions about timing and destination
    Then families can coordinate moves to stay near each other
    And community assets are managed collectively during transition
    And mutual aid supports families through the displacement
    And the community maintains agency and cohesion through the crisis
    And managed retreat happens with dignity rather than chaos
