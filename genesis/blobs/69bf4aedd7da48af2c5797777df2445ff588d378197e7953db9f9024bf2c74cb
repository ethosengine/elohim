Feature: Provincial/State-Level Governance Research for Researcher
  As a researcher in the governance system
  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer
  I want to conduct comparative quantitative studies across many communities
  So that I can identify patterns, test hypotheses, and provide generalizable findings

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the researcher user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active
    And Dr. James Chen is conducting large-scale comparative research

  Scenario: Comparing protocol adoption outcomes across hundreds of communities
    Given I am studying all communities in the state that adopted Elohim Protocol
    And I have comparison group of similar communities without adoption
    When I analyze outcomes data from 200+ communities over 5 years
    Then I examine: which communities adopted and which didn't (selection patterns)
    And I measure: wellbeing, trust, economic resilience, social cohesion differences
    And I use: difference-in-differences analysis to estimate causal effects
    And I control: for demographics, economics, political culture confounds
    And I identify: what predicts adoption success vs struggle
    And I provide: statistical evidence about protocol effectiveness at scale
    And I distinguish: average effects from heterogeneous effects across community types

  Scenario: Analyzing Regional Constitutional Council decision patterns
    Given Sarah Martinez's Regional Council has reviewed 500+ appeals
    And I have anonymized data on appeals, deliberations, and outcomes
    When I analyze patterns in regional constitutional interpretation
    Then I examine: which types of appeals succeed vs fail
    And I track: consistency across different council compositions
    And I identify: whether councils reach similar conclusions for similar cases
    And I explore: how precedent influences subsequent decisions
    And I assess: whether councils defer too much to technical experts
    And I investigate: demographic patterns in council member influence
    And My analysis reveals: whether sortition governance produces coherent law

  Scenario: Natural experiment comparing communities with vs without protocol
    Given some adjacent communities adopted protocol while neighbors didn't
    And these communities are similar in demographics and economics
    When I study outcomes comparing adopters to non-adopters
    Then I isolate: protocol effects from confounding factors
    And I measure: differences in wellbeing, crisis response, social cohesion
    And I examine: spillover effects across community boundaries
    And I analyze: why some communities adopted and others resisted
    And I provide: quasi-experimental evidence about causality
    And My findings distinguish: correlation from causation in protocol effects
    And Evidence serves policymakers deciding whether to support adoption

  Scenario: Studying marginalized community access and outcomes
    Given I hypothesize protocol might help or harm marginalized communities
    And I need to rigorously test distributional effects
    When I analyze outcomes by race, class, disability, immigration status
    Then I examine: whether marginalized communities adopt at equal rates
    And I assess: whether they face barriers to effective participation
    And I measure: whether Constitutional Council service includes them proportionally
    And I analyze: whether appeal outcomes differ by demographic group
    And I investigate: whether protocol reduces or exacerbates inequality
    And I provide: evidence about who benefits and who suffers from protocol
    And My research serves: justice by making invisible inequities visible

  Scenario: Longitudinal study of Constitutional Council member development
    Given I am tracking council members like Sarah over time
    And I want to understand how service affects them
    When I study council members before, during, and after service
    Then I measure: constitutional literacy development
    And I assess: deliberative skill acquisition
    And I examine: civic confidence and participation changes
    And I track: whether capabilities persist after service ends
    And I explore: whether service affects children's civic development
    And I analyze: whether sortition creates democratic capacity at population scale
    And My research tests: whether citizen governance transforms citizens

  Scenario: Analyzing technical expert influence on council decisions
    Given councils rely on experts like Dr. Okonkwo for technical understanding
    And I question whether experts dominate rather than inform
    When I analyze correlation between expert testimony and council decisions
    Then I examine: how often councils follow expert recommendations
    And I identify: cases where councils override expert advice
    And I assess: whether expert testimony quality predicts council confidence
    And I explore: whether some experts influence more than others
    And I investigate: warning signs of expert capture vs healthy advice
    And My research reveals: whether technical-democratic balance is working
    And Findings inform: expert testimony guidelines and council training

  Scenario: Comparative methodology testing different governance models
    Given I want to compare sortition councils to alternative governance approaches
    And some regions use elected representatives, others expert panels, others algorithms
    When I conduct systematic comparison across governance models
    Then I examine: decision quality (outcomes, constitutional alignment, legitimacy)
    And I assess: participation (who governs, how accessible, how diverse)
    And I measure: trust (public confidence in decisions)
    And I analyze: adaptability (responding to new challenges)
    And I compare: costs (resources required vs benefits delivered)
    And I provide: evidence about relative strengths of different models
    And My research serves: democratic choice among governance alternatives

  Scenario: Preregistration of hypotheses to prevent cherry-picking results
    Given I want my research to be scientifically credible
    And I know publication bias favors positive findings
    When I design my regional study
    Then I preregister: hypotheses before seeing the data
    And I commit: to reporting all results not just flattering ones
    And I plan: analysis methods in advance to prevent p-hacking
    And I document: any deviations from preregistered plan with justification
    And I publish: null results and failures alongside successes
    And My methodological rigor maintains: scientific integrity over advocacy
    And Credibility comes from: honesty about what works and what doesn't

  Scenario: Providing evidence to Senator Ruiz for policy development
    Given Senator Ruiz is drafting AI governance legislation
    And she needs evidence about what regulatory approaches help vs harm
    When I brief her committee on my regional research findings
    Then I present: rigorous evaluation of protocol outcomes
    And I explain: what factors predict successful adoption
    And I provide: evidence about marginalized community access
    And I offer: comparative findings about governance models
    And I testify: honestly about limitations and uncertainties
    And I maintain: independence by reporting truth not advocacy
    And My research becomes: evidence base for democratic policy making

  Scenario: Identifying emerging issues through annual evaluation cycles
    Given I analyze regional data annually to track trends
    And I want to identify problems before they become crises
    When I examine this year's patterns compared to previous years
    Then I notice: appeal rates trending up (good—people know recourse exists)
    And I identify: recurring adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging
    And I detect: systematic issue with business loan evaluation criteria
    And I recognize: elderly accessibility remaining challenging
    And I flag: potential issues for community leaders and policymakers
    And My timely analysis enables: proactive response to emerging challenges
    And Research provides: early warning system for governance problems

  Scenario: Regional research consortium collaboration
    Given I am part of network studying protocol across multiple regions
    And we coordinate methods to enable comparison
    When we conduct parallel studies with shared protocols
    Then we can: pool data to increase statistical power
    And we enable: replication across different contexts
    And we identify: universal patterns vs context-specific findings
    And we learn: from each other's methodological innovations
    And we create: cumulative knowledge building across research community
    And My regional work contributes to: global understanding of democratic AI governance
