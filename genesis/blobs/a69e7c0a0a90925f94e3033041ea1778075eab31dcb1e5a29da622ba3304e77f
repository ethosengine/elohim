Scenario: Integrating protocol with national court system
    Given judicial system must work with protocol governance
    And judges need training and procedural guidance
    When I work with judicial branch on integration
    Then I support: judicial education about agent reasoning
    And I establish: evidentiary standards for agent testimony
    And I create: appeal pathways for council-court conflicts
    And I ensure: due process protections maintained
    And I respect: judicial independence
    And I enable: protocol to function within legal framework
