Scenario: Equitable decision-making based on care contribution
    Given Sarah contributes 75% of household labor
    And household decisions affect everyone
    When major household decisions need to be made
    Then the household_elohim should weight input by care contribution
    And Sarah's voice should carry appropriate weight
    And care tokens should give her standing in decisions
    And those who do the work should have power over the work
    And household governance should be based on care economy equity
    And Sarah should have decision authority matching her labor
