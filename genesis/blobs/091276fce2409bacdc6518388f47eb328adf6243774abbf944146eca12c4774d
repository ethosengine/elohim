Scenario: Teaching reciprocity and mutual care through experience
    Given Tommy is learning social and moral concepts
    And reciprocity is foundational to care economy
    When Tommy both gives and receives care through the scanner
    Then he should learn that care flows in multiple directions
    And he should experience receiving recognition for his care
    And he should practice recognizing others' care for him
    And reciprocal care patterns should be modeled
    And mutual flourishing should be taught through practice
