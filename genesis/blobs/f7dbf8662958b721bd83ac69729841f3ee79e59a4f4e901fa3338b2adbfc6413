Scenario: Community resilience increases through democratic business network
    Given isolated businesses are vulnerable to economic shocks
    And community resilience depends on interconnected mutual support

    Then business survives economic downturns through network mutual aid
    And workers coordinate with other democratic enterprises for mutual benefit
    And community institutions support each other rather than competing
    And economic shocks are absorbed collectively, not destroying individual businesses
    And community_elohim coordinates resilience strategies across democratic network
