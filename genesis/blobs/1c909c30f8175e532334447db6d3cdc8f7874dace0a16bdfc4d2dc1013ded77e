Scenario: Medical appointment coordination across multiple specialists
    Given David requires regular appointments with multiple providers
    And James must coordinate complex scheduling
    When the healthcare_elohim manages appointments
    Then it should maintain integrated calendar across providers
    And it should remind James of upcoming appointments
    And it should coordinate transportation and timing
    And it should prepare James with information needed for each visit
    And medical coordination burden should be reduced through system support
