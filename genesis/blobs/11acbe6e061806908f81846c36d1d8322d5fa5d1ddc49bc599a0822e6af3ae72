Scenario: Developer faces accountability for school impact promises
    Given a developer claimed previous project would "support local schools"
    And implied tax revenue would benefit education
    When the Observer tracks actual school impacts
    Then analysis shows: enrollment increased 120 students
    And district had to add 6 portable classrooms
    And property tax revenue was $400K but school costs were $900K annually
    And promised "school support" was marketing not actual benefit
    And accountability creates pressure for honest impact assessment
