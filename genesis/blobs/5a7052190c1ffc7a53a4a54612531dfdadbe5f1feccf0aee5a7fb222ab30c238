Scenario: Family gatherings consider accessibility proactively
    Given family events often occur in inaccessible spaces
    And accessibility is frequently an afterthought
    When family gatherings are planned
    Then the family_elohim should prompt organizers to consider accessibility
    And it should provide Alex tools to communicate access needs
    And venue accessibility should be verified before events
    And Alex should not have to repeatedly advocate for basic inclusion
    And family should understand that inaccessibility equals exclusion
    And accessible planning should become family norm
    And Alex should be able to participate fully in family life
