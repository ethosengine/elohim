Scenario: Community resource coordination supports multigenerational care
    Given Robert coordinates care across multiple generations
    And community resources exist but are hard to navigate
    And he needs eldercare support, young adult resources, and family services
    When community_elohim coordinates resources
    Then it should connect Robert to relevant community support services
    And surface eldercare programs for his parents
    And identify young adult support programs for his children
    And connect him to caregiver support groups
    And reduce time spent researching and coordinating resources
    And demonstrate that community infrastructure should serve caregivers
    And make visible the resources built through care economy
