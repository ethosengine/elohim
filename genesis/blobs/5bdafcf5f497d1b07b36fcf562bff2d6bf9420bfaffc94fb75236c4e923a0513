Scenario: Household boundaries coordinate with individual autonomy
    Given Sarah has individual autonomy over her choices
    And she also participates in household governance
    When Sarah makes decisions affecting the household
    Then household boundaries should be negotiated, not imposed
    And Sarah should maintain individual agency within household context
    And household_elohim should balance individual and collective needs
    And neither Sarah nor partner should dominate household governance
    And equitable partnership should be structurally supported
