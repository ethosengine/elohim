Scenario: Developer local hiring commitment gains enforcement
    Given a developer promised 60% local hiring as approval condition
    And community counted on jobs for neighborhood residents
    When the Observer tracks hiring outcomes
    Then analysis shows: only 22% of jobs went to local residents
    And most workers came from outside region
    And community that bore development impacts didn't receive promised jobs
    And accountability creates consequences for broken employment commitments
    And future commitments require enforceable mechanisms
