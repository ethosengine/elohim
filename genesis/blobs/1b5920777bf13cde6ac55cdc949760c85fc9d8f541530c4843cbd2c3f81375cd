Scenario: Investment returns include documented environmental benefits
    Given traditional investment ignores or externalizes environmental impacts
    And Patricia wants to know investment's ecological effects
    When democratic businesses document environmental stewardship
    Then impact reports include: carbon sequestered, water quality protected, biodiversity supported
    And environmental benefits are measured using bioregional ecological indicators
    And investment returns are financial plus ecological restoration
    And capital allocation becomes ecological stewardship tool
    And bioregional_elohim provides environmental impact measurement and reporting
