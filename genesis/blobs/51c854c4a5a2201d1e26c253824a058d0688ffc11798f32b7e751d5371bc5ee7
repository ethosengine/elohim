Scenario: Citizen evaluates school board candidate claims
    Given a school board candidate promises to improve education quality
    And the election is approaching
    When the citizen reviews Observer analysis
    Then they see the candidate's specific policy positions
    And view comparisons to successful districts' approaches
    And understand likely impacts of proposed policies
    And can evaluate campaign promises against evidence
    And informed voting becomes accessible
