Scenario: Advocating for sustainable food practices at work
    Given my workplace makes decisions about sourcing and operations
    When I want to advocate for more sustainable and care-aligned practices
    Then the protocol should help me propose sustainable improvements
    Such as local sourcing, waste reduction, composting, sustainable packaging
    And provide evidence for ecological and economic benefits
    And support me in advocating for care-economy-aligned food operations
