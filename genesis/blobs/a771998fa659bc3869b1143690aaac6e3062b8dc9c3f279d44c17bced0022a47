Scenario: Senior center programs maintain social connection and engagement
    Given Helen participates in senior center activities
    And social connection prevents isolation and decline
    When Helen engages with senior center programs
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate transportation
    And accessibility should be ensured for all programs
    And her participation should be recognized as community contribution
    And programs should preserve dignity and agency
    And senior centers should be spaces of continued growth, not warehousing
    And the protocol should support elder engagement in community life
    And Helen should experience valued participation, not make-work
