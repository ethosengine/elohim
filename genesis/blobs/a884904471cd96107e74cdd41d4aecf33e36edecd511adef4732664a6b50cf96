    Given community economic development typically means corporate recruitment with subsidies
    And Ms. Johnson's consumption patterns seemed economically insignificant

    And aggregate customer choices determine which business models thrive
    And consumption becomes vote for economic democracy vs. extraction
    And neighborhood economy transforms through collective customer choices
    And community_elohim helps customers understand collective impact of consumption
