Scenario: Parent involvement recognition values Maria's solo engagement
    Given Maria manages all school engagement for three children alone
    And partnered parents split involvement between two people
    When schools recognize parent involvement
    Then the educational_elohim should quantify Maria's engagement across all three children
    And her solo involvement should be recognized as extraordinary effort
    And schools should value her participation even if she cannot match two-parent family availability
    And parent involvement metrics should account for family structure differences
    And Maria should receive appropriate recognition for managing everything alone
