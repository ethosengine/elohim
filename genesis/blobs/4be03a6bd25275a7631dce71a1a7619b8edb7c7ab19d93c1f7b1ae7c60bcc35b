**Introduction:** Review, evolution of Trust  \- https://ncase.me/trust/ 

Game theory has shown us the three things we need for the evolution of trust:  
1\. REPEAT INTERACTIONS Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions before trust can evolve.  
2\. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS You must be playing a non-zero-sum game, a game where it's at least possible that both players can be better off \-- a win-win.  
3\. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION  If the level of miscommunication is too high, trust breaks down. But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be more forgiving.Of course, real-world trust is affected by much more than this. There's reputation, shared values, contracts, cultural markers, blah blah blah. And let's not forget the biggest lesson: 

If there's one big takeaway  
from all of game theory, it's this:

What the game is, defines what the players do.  
Our problem today isn't just that people are losing trust,  
it's that our environment acts against the evolution of trust.

That may seem cynical or naive \-- that we're "merely" products of our environment \-- but as game theory reminds us, we are each others' environment. In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run, it's us players who define the game.

So, do what you can do, to create the conditions necessary to evolve trust. Build relationships. Find win-wins. Communicate clearly. Maybe then, we can stop firing at each other, get out of our own trenches, cross No Man's Land to come together... ...to live and let live."A Christmas Truce between Opposing Trenches" Illustrated by AC Michael.

**Conclusion:** Conclusion: Scaling Wisdom through Christian-Informed System Design  
As we conclude this module on setting the stage for scaling wisdom, let's focus on how Christian technologists can leverage system design principles to amplify and distribute godly wisdom in our digital age:

Scaling Godly Wisdom: A Meta-Statement

Reflecting deeply on the righteous leaders of the Old Testament, the teachings of Jesus, and the modern context of exponential technology and information systems, we can distill a meta-statement that might encapsulate God's perspective on righteous leadership and scaling wisdom:

Christians "Design systems of heart and mind that cultivate humble seekers of truth, who grow in wisdom through obedient action, and who shoulder expanding responsibility with increasing grace and discernment. These systems should foster communities where knowledge and understanding flow freely, where power serves rather than dominates, and where each member is equipped and inspired to steward their influence for the flourishing of all."

Key elements of this meta-statement:

1\. \*\*Humble Truth-Seeking\*\*: Echoes the Old Testament leaders' reliance on God's wisdom and Jesus' teachings on humility.  
2\. \*\*Wisdom Through Obedience\*\*: Reflects the consistent theme of leaders acting on God's guidance.  
3\. \*\*Expanding Responsibility\*\*: Respects of increasing responsibilities with increased rights and power.  
4\. \*\*Free Flow of Knowledge\*\*: Addresses the need for informed participants in complex systems.  
5\. \*\*Servant Leadership\*\*: Embodies Jesus' model of leadership and power used for others' benefit.  
6\. \*\*Stewardship of Influence\*\*: Encompasses the Old Testament leaders' role in guiding society and the modern need for responsible use of technology and information.

This meta-statement aims to bridge ancient wisdom with modern challenges, providing a framework for designing systems \- technological, social, and spiritual \- that scale godly wisdom in our complex world.

### Conclusion

Conclusion: Scaling Wisdom through Christian-Informed System Design  
As we conclude this module on setting the stage for scaling wisdom, let's focus on how Christian technologists can leverage system design principles to amplify and distribute godly wisdom in our digital age:

Scaling Godly Wisdom: A Meta-Statement

Reflecting deeply on the righteous leaders of the Old Testament, the teachings of Jesus, and the modern context of exponential technology and information systems, we can distill a meta-statement that might encapsulate God's perspective on righteous leadership and scaling wisdom:

Christians "Design systems of heart and mind that cultivate humble seekers of truth, who grow in wisdom through obedient action, and who shoulder expanding responsibility with increasing grace and discernment. These systems should foster communities where knowledge and understanding flow freely, where power serves rather than dominates, and where each member is equipped and inspired to steward their influence for the flourishing of all."

Key elements of this meta-statement:

1\. \*\*Humble Truth-Seeking\*\*: Echoes the Old Testament leaders' reliance on God's wisdom and Jesus' teachings on humility.  
2\. \*\*Wisdom Through Obedience\*\*: Reflects the consistent theme of leaders acting on God's guidance.  
3\. \*\*Expanding Responsibility\*\*: Respects of increasing responsibilities with increased rights and power.  
4\. \*\*Free Flow of Knowledge\*\*: Addresses the need for informed participants in complex systems.  
5\. \*\*Servant Leadership\*\*: Embodies Jesus' model of leadership and power used for others' benefit.  
6\. \*\*Stewardship of Influence\*\*: Encompasses the Old Testament leaders' role in guiding society and the modern need for responsible use of technology and information.

This meta-statement aims to bridge ancient wisdom with modern challenges, providing a framework for designing systems \- technological, social, and spiritual \- that scale godly wisdom in our complex world.

### Application 

\* We need to hold ourselves as an institution to a higher standard than is minimally required by law, especially in areas where we are found to be lacking, sexual misconduct, tax-law, equity and inclusion (both racial and class) .. (any others?)  Doing more than what's minimially required with boldness gives institutions opportunities to build trust. 

\* Churches need to prioritize highly accurate, authentic, and meaningful communication as a discipline (not one minister's job), that everyone is a participant. What technology we use to do to facilitate that should help us have complex face-to-face encounters, and increase collaborative opporutinties.   
 If you are a ministry leader, there needs to be obvious ways to create a story, have it reviewed, and get it published. There needs to be a clarity in the process and a strong incentive for people to participate and be heard. 

\*  Churches needs to priritize complex interactions:    
    \-  Accessible and dynamic in-person small group networks need robust platform support for Discoverability, Scheduling, and Invitation.  
    \- Transition times between Service and Class aren't just dead space, these are KEY invatational moments to build REAL community, Extend     these times, inviting SPACES for people to enter into deeper conversation.  Extend the pick-up times for Childrens misintry, release kids to the playground.   
    \-  Prioritize high-quality meals at the building that would incentivize people to stay for lunch and provide flexibility for childcare.    

Wisdom Amplification Systems: Design platforms that don't just inform, but help users develop discernment. This could involve AI-assisted analysis tools that guide users through critical thinking processes, echoing Proverbs 4:7: "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom."  
Collaborative Discernment Mechanisms: Create systems that facilitate group decision-making processes based on biblical principles. This could include digital spaces for communal prayer, reflection, and discussion, embodying James 1:5: "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God."  
Ethical Impact Visualization: Develop tools that help users see the long-term consequences of their digital actions, fostering a sense of ethical responsibility. This aligns with Galatians 6:7: "A man reaps what he sows."  
Wisdom Distribution Networks: Design algorithms that prioritize the spread of wise counsel and thoughtful reflection over mere viral content, inspired by Proverbs 15:31: "Whoever heeds life-giving correction will be at home among the wise."  
Stewardship-Centered UX: Create user experiences that encourage mindful use of time and attention, helping users grow in digital stewardship. This embodies 1 Peter 4:10: "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others."

Actionable Steps for Scaling Wisdom

Implement Reflection Prompts: Integrate moments of pause and reflection into user flows, encouraging thoughtful engagement rather than mindless scrolling.  
Develop Wisdom Metrics: Create new metrics that measure growth in discernment and wise decision-making, not just engagement or time spent.  
Design for Diverse Insights: Build systems that intentionally expose users to diverse perspectives, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues.  
Create Ethical Sandboxes: Develop safe spaces within platforms where users can explore the consequences of their digital actions without real-world repercussions.  
Implement Wisdom-Sharing Features: Design tools that make it easy for users to share insights and life lessons, creating a crowd-sourced wisdom repository.  
Build Digital Discipleship Tools: Create features that support mentorship and discipleship relationships, scaling personal growth through technology.  
Integrate Scripture-Based Guidance: Develop AI systems that can offer relevant biblical wisdom in response to user queries or situations.

As we apply these principles, let us be guided by Colossians 3:16-17: "Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom... And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him."  
Our calling as Christian technologists is not just to create efficient systems, but to design digital ecosystems that cultivate and scale godly wisdom. By integrating these principles into our work, we can leverage technology to amplify biblical insights, foster discernment, and guide users towards Christ-like decision making. In doing so, we participate in God's redemptive work, transforming our digital landscapes into spaces where wisdom flourishes and communities are built up in faith and understanding.
