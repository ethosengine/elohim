Given protocol creates new forms of governance and rights
And constitutional recognition would strengthen legitimacy
When I propose national constitutional amendment
Then I recognize: sortition governance as legitimate democratic form
And I establish: right to appeal agent decisions
And I protect: community sovereignty over protocol adoption
And I enshrine: privacy protections and dignity guarantees
And amendment goes through: lengthy deliberative process
And if passed: transforms national constitutional framework
And protocol gains: highest legal recognition
