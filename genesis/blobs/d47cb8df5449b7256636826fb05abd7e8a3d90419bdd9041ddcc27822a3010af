Scenario: Family care tokens reflect preteen's substantial contributions
    Given the family participates in care token economy
    And Marcus performs significant household labor
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Marcus's contributions should be valued at realistic rates
    And tokens should reflect that his work would be compensated if adult performed it
    And family care token total should include his contributions
    And tokens should qualify family for community resource access
    And Marcus's demonstrated stewardship should be evidence of family capability
    And care economy should channel support to families like Marcus's
