Scenario: Policy advocacy improves accessibility for entire community
    Given Alex advocates for accessibility improvements in public spaces
    And better accessibility benefits everyone, not just disabled people
    When community accessibility improves due to Alex's advocacy
    Then these improvements should be attributed to Alex's care work
    And the community_elohim should track policy changes Alex influences
    And curb cuts, accessible transit, universal design benefit whole community
    And Alex should be recognized as community improver at scale
    And care tokens should reflect population-level impact
    And the protocol should make undeniable Alex's gift to community
    And cultural narrative should shift from burden to contributor
