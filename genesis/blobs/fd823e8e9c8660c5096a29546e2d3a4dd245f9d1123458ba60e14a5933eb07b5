# Value Flows: Tracking What Matters

## What Flows Where

Every day, enormous value flows through your life:
- Money you earn and spend
- Time you give and receive
- Care you provide and accept
- Knowledge you share and learn
- Trust you build and draw on

Current systems only track the first one.

## The Visibility Problem

When value is invisible:
- **Caregivers burn out**: No recognition, no support
- **Communities decay**: Social capital isn't measured or maintained
- **Ecosystems degrade**: Environmental costs aren't counted
- **Policy fails**: Decisions based on incomplete data
- **Inequality grows**: Invisible contributions stay unrewarded

## How Value Flows Work

### The Flow Concept
A value flow is:
- **What**: The resource that's moving (attention, goods, care, money)
- **From/To**: The agents involved (people, organizations, communities)
- **Context**: Why it's happening (exchange, gift, duty, need)
- **Consequence**: What changes as a result

### Types of Flows
**Reciprocal Exchange**
- You give something, you get something
- Traditional market transaction
- Also: time banks, skill exchanges, mutual aid

**Gift/Contribution**
- You give, you don't expect return
- Donation, volunteering, open source
- Creates social capital, builds community

**Care/Support**
- Ongoing relationship of nurture
- Parenting, eldercare, mentorship
- Hard to quantify, essential to flourishing

**Extraction/Exploitation**
- Value taken without adequate return
- Wage theft, platform extraction, colonialism
- Making this visible enables resistance

## The ValueFlows Vocabulary

The Elohim Protocol uses ValueFlows—an open standard for tracking economic activity:

### Core Concepts
- **Agent**: Who's involved (person, organization, community)
- **Resource**: What's flowing (goods, services, attention, care)
- **Event**: What happened (production, consumption, transfer)
- **Process**: A transformation (teaching, caregiving, manufacturing)
- **Intent**: A planned action (offer, request, commitment)

### Why Open Standards
- **Interoperability**: Different communities can share data
- **Portability**: Your history travels with you
- **Transparency**: No proprietary black boxes
- **Community-controlled**: Not owned by any company

## Practical Applications

### Mutual Aid Networks
Track who helped whom:
- "Maria helped with childcare 4 hours"
- "James provided transportation 3 times"
- "Community garden produced 200 lbs vegetables"

Enable reciprocity:
- When Maria needs help, her contributions are visible
- Community can see gaps and surpluses
- No one tracks debts; patterns emerge naturally

### Impact Measurement
Move beyond vanity metrics:
- Not "how many meals served" but "hunger reduced"
- Not "training hours provided" but "skills gained"
- Not "volunteers recruited" but "community capacity built"

Track what actually matters:
- Wellbeing outcomes, not just activities
- Relationship quality, not just transaction counts
- Ecological regeneration, not just less harm

### Community Currencies
Local exchange systems:
- Backed by community capacity, not central banks
- Value stays in community
- Care work becomes exchangeable
- Visible flows enable trust

## For Policy Makers: Value-Flow-Informed Policy

What if policy could see all value flows?
- Childcare infrastructure investment → measurable care outcomes
- Small business support → visible local economic circulation
- Environmental regulation → tracked ecosystem services

### Implementation
- Require value flow reporting for public contracts
- Fund infrastructure for community value tracking
- Integrate care metrics into economic indicators
- Support interoperable standards

## For Developers: Building Flow Infrastructure

Technical requirements:
- **Event logging**: What happened, when, involving whom
- **Resource tracking**: What exists, where, in what condition
- **Agent identity**: Consistent across contexts, privacy-preserving
- **Query interfaces**: Who contributed what to whom when
- **Visualization**: Make patterns visible and understandable

## For Everyone: Seeing Your Flows

Start noticing the value you create and receive:
- What did you give today that wasn't compensated?
- What did you receive that you didn't pay for?
- Where is value flowing out of your community?
- What value is invisible that should be recognized?

Your Elohim can help you track and visualize your flows.

## Connection to Recognition

Tracking value flows enables recognition. The final unit explores how recognition systems work—how visible value becomes acknowledged value.
