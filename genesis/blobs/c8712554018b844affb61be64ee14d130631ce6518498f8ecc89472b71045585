Scenario: Protecting tiny spaces for Maria's personal identity and flourishing
    Given Maria's life is consumed by parenting and work demands
    And she has almost no time or energy for herself
    When the personal_agent monitors Maria's well-being
    Then it should identify and protect small moments for personal care
    And it should remind Maria that she exists beyond her parenting role
    And it should help her maintain individual identity despite overwhelming demands
    And it should advocate for her personal needs, not just children's needs
    And Maria should be supported in being a person, not just a parent
