Scenario: Household contribution recognition for care reciprocity
    Given Helen has lived in this home for 40 years
    And she raised family and contributed to community from this household
    When household care economy is tracked
    Then her lifetime of household labor should be visible
    And her decades of contribution should create legitimate claims
    And current care receipt should be framed as reciprocity
    And she should not feel like a burden in her own home
    And the household_elohim should surface her contribution history
    And care flowing to her should be recognized as earned through lifetime of giving
