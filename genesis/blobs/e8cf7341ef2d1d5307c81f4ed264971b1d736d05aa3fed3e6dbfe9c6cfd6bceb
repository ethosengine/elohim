Scenario: Climate change impacts on food systems understood concretely
    Given climate change affects food production and prices
    And Marcus experiences food cost volatility
    When Marcus encounters price fluctuations
    Then the personal_agent should explain climate impacts on agriculture
    And it should connect extreme weather to food availability
    And climate education should be grounded in lived experience
    And he should understand climate as care economy issue
    And ecological crisis should be framed as requiring care-based response
    And his generation should be prepared to steward through climate chaos
