Scenario: Teaching grandchildren sustainable living practices
    Given Margaret teaches Tommy and Emma to reduce waste and value resources
    And she models careful use of food, water, energy, materials
    When Margaret provides ecological education
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize environmental teaching
    And it should value transmission of sustainable living practices
    And it should track grandchildren's ecological learning
    And environmental education should accumulate care tokens
    And Margaret's teaching should be recognized as essential for sustainability
    And next generation should learn resource stewardship from elders
