Scenario: Neighborhood care economy connects families across community
    Given multiple families in neighborhood participate in Value Scanner
    And Emma's family is part of neighborhood network
    When Emma makes care contributions through shopping
    Then her contributions should feed into neighborhood care economy
    And the neighborhood_elohim should track community care patterns
    And Emma should learn care extends beyond her household
    And she should see her family as part of larger community
    And neighborhood-level recognition should be age-appropriate
    And community belonging should be built through care visibility
