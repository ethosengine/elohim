Scenario: Climate adaptation planning for multigenerational family resilience
    Given climate change affects bioregional systems
    And Robert's family will navigate climate impacts across generations
    And adaptation planning protects family and bioregional resilience
    When bioregional_elohim supports climate adaptation
    Then it should help Robert plan for climate impacts on family
    And surface bioregional climate risks: drought, flooding, extreme weather
    And support household adaptation: water conservation, emergency preparedness, resilient food systems
    And connect adaptation to care economy principles
    And recognize that climate adaptation is care for family and bioregion
    And build resilience that serves current and future generations
    And demonstrate that ecological care is practical family responsibility
