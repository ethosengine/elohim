Scenario: Demanding workplace democracy and worker voice
    Given decisions affecting my life are made without my input
    When I want to advocate for worker participation in decisions
    Then the protocol should support advocacy for workplace democracy
    And help me articulate the case for worker voice in governance
    And provide information about worker ownership and cooperative models
    And build consciousness that workers deserve decision-making power
