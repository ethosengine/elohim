Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Adult
  As an adult participating in community governance
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want my care contributions to create community resilience
  So that community resources and leadership reflect demonstrated care work

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the adult user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah actively participates in community care economy
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim coordinates community-level care
    And community includes schools, food cooperatives, civic organizations

  Scenario: Community care contributions qualify Sarah for leadership
    Given Sarah has accumulated substantial care contributions
    And community leadership positions require demonstrated commitment
    When community selects leaders
    Then Sarah's quantified care work should be visible evidence
    And her school involvement should be tracked
    And her food cooperative participation should be recognized
    And her community organizing should be valued
    And leadership should go to those who demonstrate care, not just those who talk
    And care economy should create accountability in community governance

  Scenario: School involvement recognized as substantial care work
    Given Sarah is actively involved in her children's school
    And she volunteers in classrooms, organizes events, advocates for policies
    When community care contributions are tracked
    Then the community_elohim should quantify Sarah's school involvement
    And volunteer hours should be valued as care work
    And parent advocacy should be recognized as community contribution
    And school participation should give Sarah voice in educational governance
    And care for education should be visible and valued

  Scenario: Food cooperative participation builds community food security
    Given Sarah participates in community food cooperative
    And she contributes labor to collective food purchasing
    When food cooperative operates
    Then the community_elohim should track Sarah's contributions
    And it should coordinate cooperative logistics
    And it should connect Sarah to other food security advocates
    And cooperative should reduce costs for all members
    And community food security should be built through care economy
    And Sarah's contributions should be recognized and valued

  Scenario: Community care tokens enable resource access based on contribution
    Given Sarah has accumulated care tokens through community participation
    And community resources are allocated based on care contributions
    When Sarah needs community support
    Then her care tokens should give her access to resources
    And community mutual aid should be available
    And support should be based on demonstrated contribution
    And care economy should function as community resource system
    And Sarah's care work should have tangible value

  Scenario: Community organizations coordinate through care economy principles
    Given Sarah participates in multiple community organizations
    And these organizations share care economy values
    When community organizations coordinate activities
    Then the community_elohim should facilitate coordination
    And it should prevent Sarah from being overcommitted
    And it should enable meaningful contribution across organizations
    And community sector should adopt care economy practices
    And organizational effectiveness should improve through coordination

  Scenario: Community policy advocacy informed by care economy data
    Given Sarah advocates for community policy changes
    And data about care work supports policy arguments
    When Sarah engages in advocacy
    Then the community_elohim should provide aggregated care economy data
    And Sarah should show that care work is substantial and invisible
    And policy discussions should be informed by actual care patterns
    And advocacy should be strengthened by quantified evidence
    And care economy data should transform policy debates

  Scenario: Community mutual aid network provides support during crisis
    Given Sarah or community members may face crises
    And traditional systems often fail to provide adequate support
    When Sarah experiences job loss, health emergency, or family crisis
    Then the community_elohim should connect her to mutual aid network
    And support should be immediate, dignified, and effective
    And community should function as safety net
    And Sarah's previous contributions should enable access to help
    And mutual aid should be reciprocal and community-based

  Scenario: Community care economy includes diverse cultural approaches
    Given Sarah's community includes diverse cultural backgrounds
    And different cultures have different care economy traditions
    When community care economy operates
    Then the community_elohim should respect cultural diversity
    And it should accommodate different care practices
    And it should not impose single cultural framework
    And diverse approaches should be honored and integrated
    And community care economy should be culturally adaptive

  Scenario: Preventing Sarah's overcommitment through community coordination
    Given Sarah is highly engaged in community
    And she tends to say yes to too many requests
    When community organizations ask Sarah to contribute
    Then the community_elohim should track her total commitments
    And it should warn Sarah when she's approaching overcommitment
    And it should help her maintain sustainable participation
    And community should benefit from Sarah's long-term engagement
    And burnout should be prevented through coordination

  Scenario: Community resource sharing reduces individual costs at scale
    Given community members have complementary needs and resources
    And collective action can reduce costs significantly
    When community organizes resource sharing
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate tool libraries
    And it should facilitate skill sharing networks
    And it should organize bulk purchasing cooperatives
    And community members should benefit economically from cooperation
    And care economy should provide material benefits, not just recognition

  Scenario: Community care contributions connect to municipal governance
    Given Sarah's community care work is substantial
    And municipal policy affects community well-being
    When municipal governance decisions are made
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her voice
    And community care economy data should inform municipal policy
    And care work should be recognized at municipal level
    And Sarah's advocacy should carry weight based on demonstrated contribution
    And care economy should scale from community to municipal governance

  Scenario: Community privacy protects members while enabling coordination
    Given community care economy involves data about many people
    And privacy must be protected rigorously
    When community care patterns are tracked
    Then the community_elohim should only share aggregated data
    And individual household details should remain private
    And Sarah should control what community sees about her family
    And community coordination should not require privacy sacrifice
    And data should serve community well-being, not surveillance

  Scenario: Community care economy demonstrates alternative to extraction economics
    Given Sarah's community has adopted care economy practices
    And mainstream economics devalue care work
    When community care economy becomes visible
    Then it should demonstrate that alternatives to capitalism are viable
    And it should show care work creates real value
    And it should inspire other communities to adopt similar practices
    And Sarah's community should serve as model
    And care economy transformation should spread through demonstrated success
