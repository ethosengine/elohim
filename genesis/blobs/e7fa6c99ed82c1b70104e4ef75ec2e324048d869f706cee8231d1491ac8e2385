Scenario: Personal burnout prevention during academic pressure
    Given Kenji faces intense academic demands during midterms and finals
    And he also must maintain work hours to pay for expenses
    When the personal_agent detects unsustainable stress patterns
    Then it should flag burnout risk explicitly
    And it should say "You've slept 4 hours three nights in a row. This is dangerous."
    And it should help him identify what must give to protect health
    And it should connect him to campus mental health resources if needed
    And crisis intervention should prioritize his survival
    And the system should validate that breaking under these demands is not failure
