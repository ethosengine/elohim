Scenario: Tool sharing and maintenance reduces consumption and waste
    Given Frank has accumulated quality tools over decades
    And tool sharing reduces unnecessary consumption
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates tool libraries
    Then it should facilitate Frank sharing tools with community
    And help him teach tool maintenance and care
    And recognize tool sharing as ecological and community contribution
    And reduce tool consumption through shared resources
    And Frank's tool knowledge should serve community self-sufficiency
    And his participation should model sharing economy practices
