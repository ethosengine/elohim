Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained for teen autonomy
    Given Jasmine has been using the Value Scanner extensively
    And constitutional constraints protect her agency
    When Jasmine chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then the disconnection must be honored immediately
    And no data retention beyond legal requirements should occur
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
    And her right to not participate must be respected
    And her care contributions should be exportable in standard format
    And she should maintain full control over her participation
