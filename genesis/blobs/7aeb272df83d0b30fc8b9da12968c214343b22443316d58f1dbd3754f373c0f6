Scenario: Local supplier relationships strengthen through franchise purchasing liberation
    Given franchise mandatory purchasing prevented supporting local suppliers
    And community wealth extracted through corporate supply chain
    When purchasing autonomy enables local sourcing decisions
    Then democratic locations source from Johnson Farm and neighborhood suppliers
    And supply chain spending circulates in community, not extracting to national distributors
    And supplier relationships become partnerships benefiting both parties
    And transparent supply chain shows community members how their spending supports local economy
    And community_elohim coordinates local supply relationships for maximum community benefit
