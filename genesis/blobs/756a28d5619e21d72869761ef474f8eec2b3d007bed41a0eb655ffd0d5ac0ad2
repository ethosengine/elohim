Scenario: Franchise surveillance systems convert to worker-controlled witness infrastructure
    Given corporate-mandated cameras monitored workers for compliance and speedup
    And surveillance served corporate extraction, not worker protection
    When conversion disconnects corporate surveillance feed
    Then cameras network to local Elohim node under worker control
    And footage protects workers from customer harassment and safety violations
    And surveillance data cannot be used for discipline or productivity pressure
    And workers democratically govern when and how footage is accessed
    And workplace_elohim ensures corporate has no backdoor access to surveillance
