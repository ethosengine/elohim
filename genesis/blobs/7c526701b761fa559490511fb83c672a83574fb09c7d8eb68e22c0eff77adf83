Scenario: Coordinating household responsibilities with children age-appropriately
    Given I need age-appropriate help from children with household tasks
    And I want to avoid parentifying children or burdening them inappropriately
    When I assign household responsibilities
    Then the Value Scanner helps me identify appropriate contributions for each child's age
    And ensures children contribute without bearing adult burdens
    And tracks household task completion and distributes fairly
    And validates children's contributions with care token recognition
    And helps me balance children's help with their need to be children
    And my personal_agent reminds children of tasks without nagging
    And recognizes my calibration of appropriate responsibility as sophisticated parenting
    And supports healthy household participation for all members
