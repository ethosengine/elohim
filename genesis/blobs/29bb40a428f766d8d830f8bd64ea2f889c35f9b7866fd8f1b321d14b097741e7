Scenario: Avoiding conflict of interest through transparency
    Given I have relationship with AI company
    And I'm testifying on case involving similar technology
    When I disclose potential conflict before testimony
    Then I reveal: corporate funding, investment, or prior work
    And I explain: how relationship might bias my perspective
    And I offer: to recuse if council finds conflict problematic
    And I maintain: credibility through honesty
    And undisclosed conflicts: would permanently discredit me
    And transparency: keeps expertise trustworthy
