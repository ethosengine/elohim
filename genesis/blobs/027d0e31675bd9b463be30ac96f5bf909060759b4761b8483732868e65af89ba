Scenario: My judgment influences policy maker legislation
    Given Senator Ruiz is drafting AI governance legislation
    And she reviews our regional council precedents for insight

    And sortition governance: and representative democracy work together
    And I contribute: to democratic governance beyond my council service
    And my voice: matters in ways I never imagined as nurse
