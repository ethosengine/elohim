Scenario: Contributing to regional policy improvement through recommendations
    Given we identified gaps in agent protocols through appeals
    And we documented recommendations for improvement
    When community leaders and policy makers review our guidance
    Then protocol developers: implement our suggested enhancements
    And communities: consider our calibration recommendations
    And policy makers: craft legislation addressing the gaps
    And our constitutional interpretation: drives continuous improvement
    And democratic feedback loop: connects citizen oversight to systemic learning
    And my service: makes governance better for region
