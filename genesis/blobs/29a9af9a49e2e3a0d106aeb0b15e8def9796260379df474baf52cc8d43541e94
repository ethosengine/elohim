    And her household needs ongoing adaptation
    When accessibility needs change over time
    Then the household_elohim should proactively suggest adaptations
    And Helen should be consulted on all modifications
    And her home should evolve to support her changing capabilities
    And the goal should be maximum independence at home
    And dignity should be preserved throughout adaptation
    And the protocol should enable aging in place with grace
    And her ability to remain home should be extended as long as possible
