Scenario: Climate adaptation knowledge from lived experience
    Given Margaret has observed environmental changes over decades
    And adaptation requires long-term observation
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates climate adaptation
    Then Margaret's observations should inform adaptation strategies
    And her knowledge of changing patterns should be valued
    And long-term perspective should shape bioregional planning
    And senior experience should guide community resilience
    And climate adaptation should benefit from elder wisdom
    And Margaret's lifetime of observation should serve collective response
