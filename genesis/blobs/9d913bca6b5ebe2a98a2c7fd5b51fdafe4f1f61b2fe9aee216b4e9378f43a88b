Scenario: Transitioning from temporary assistance to employment without losing critical support prematurely
    Given I receive temporary assistance (SNAP, TANF, housing support, childcare subsidies)
    And employment may affect benefit eligibility
    When I transition from assistance to employment
    Then the workplace_elohim helps me understand benefits cliff dynamics
    And calculates whether employment genuinely improves my financial situation after benefit loss
    And identifies transition supports that prevent benefit cliff harm
    And validates that benefits cliff is policy failure, not my failure
    And helps me time employment transition to minimize harm
    And my personal_agent tracks benefit eligibility thresholds and employment income
    And recognizes that benefits navigation is complex policy navigation labor
    And ensures employment transition genuinely serves rather than harms my family
