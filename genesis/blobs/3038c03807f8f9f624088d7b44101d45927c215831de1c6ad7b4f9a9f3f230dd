Scenario: Managing household during crisis transitions (shelter to housing, housing to housing)
    Given I am moving from transitional housing to permanent housing
    And household operations must continue during major disruption
    When I coordinate the moving transition
    Then the Value Scanner helps me manage transition logistics
    And maintains children's routines as much as possible during chaos
    And tracks what needs to happen when (utilities, school transfers, address changes)
    And helps me coordinate assistance with moving
    And ensures essential household functions continue uninterrupted
    And my personal_agent prevents critical tasks from being forgotten
    And recognizes transition management as substantial invisible labor
    And celebrates successful navigation of major household disruption
