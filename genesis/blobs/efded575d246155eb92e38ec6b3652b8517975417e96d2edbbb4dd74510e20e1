Scenario: Individual autonomy maintained within caregiving constraints
    Given caregiving severely limits James's choices
    And he cannot leave David for extended periods
    And his schedule revolves entirely around care needs
    When James makes personal decisions
    Then the personal_agent should protect his autonomy
    And it should identify opportunities for individual agency
    And it should help James maintain some life beyond caregiving
    And constraints should be acknowledged but not completely controlling
    And James should retain some sphere of personal freedom
