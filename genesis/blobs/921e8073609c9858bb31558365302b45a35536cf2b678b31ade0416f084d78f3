Scenario: Parent-teacher conferences scheduled for working single parent availability
    Given Maria must attend conferences for three children across different schools
    And she has no co-parent to split attendance or attend in her place
    When schools schedule parent-teacher conferences
    Then the educational_elohim should coordinate scheduling across multiple schools
    And schools should offer evening or flexible timing for working single parents
    And Maria should not have to take multiple work days for conferences
    And scheduling should recognize single parents cannot "send the other parent"
    And educational engagement should be accessible to working solo parents
