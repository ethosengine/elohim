Scenario: Neighborhood supports work-life balance for middle-aged adults
    Given Robert manages intense work and care demands
    And neighborhood support could ease his burden
    And he can also provide flexibility support to neighbors
    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates flexible support
    Then it should connect neighbors who can provide backup care
    And help Robert find local support for care emergencies
    And recognize his contributions when he helps neighbors
    And build mutual support networks for managing work-life balance
    And reduce isolation of managing demands alone
    And demonstrate that neighborhoods can support balanced lives
    And strengthen community through practical mutual aid
