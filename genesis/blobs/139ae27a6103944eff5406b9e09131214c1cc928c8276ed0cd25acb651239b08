Scenario: Preventing invisible labor imbalances that damage relationships
    Given household labor often falls unfairly on women
    And invisible imbalances breed resentment
    When the household_elohim monitors labor distribution
    Then it should identify unfair distributions early
    And it should surface imbalances before they cause conflict
    And both partners should receive prompts about equity
    And adjustments should be negotiated from data, not resentment
    And the protocol should protect relationship health through fairness
