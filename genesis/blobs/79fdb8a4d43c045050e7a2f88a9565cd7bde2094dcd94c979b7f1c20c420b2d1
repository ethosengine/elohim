Given authoritarian regimes may attack protocol infrastructure
And democratic nations must respond collectively
When I participate in democratic coalition
Then we share: threat intelligence and defensive strategies
And we coordinate: mutual support for communities under threat
And we establish: sanctuary systems for protocol refugees
And we resist: authoritarian pressure through solidarity
And we provide: resources for communities defending sovereignty
And we demonstrate: that democracy protects itself
And we show: authoritarian capture is not inevitable
