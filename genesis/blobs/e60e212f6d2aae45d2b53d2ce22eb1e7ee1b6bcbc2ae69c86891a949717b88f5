# Platform Design: From Extraction to Flourishing

## The Extraction Economy

Current social platforms are designed to extract:
- **Attention**: Keep you scrolling as long as possible
- **Data**: Harvest everything you do for advertisers
- **Content**: Your creativity is their inventory
- **Connections**: Your relationships are their network effects

The business model is simple: you are the product.

## What Extraction Looks Like

### The Engagement Trap
Platforms optimize for time-on-site, not value-to-user:
- Infinite scroll eliminates natural stopping points
- Notifications interrupt real life
- Variable reward schedules (like slot machines)
- Outrage drives more engagement than insight

### The Algorithmic Feed
You don't choose what you see; algorithms do:
- Optimized for engagement, not relevance
- Creates filter bubbles and echo chambers
- Amplifies extreme content
- Changes without notice or consent

### The Data Harvest
Everything you do is captured and sold:
- Location, contacts, browsing history
- Typing patterns, attention duration
- Emotional states inferred from behavior
- Shared with thousands of "partners"

### The Creator Squeeze
Content creators face:
- Algorithmic changes that destroy businesses overnight
- Demonetization without explanation
- Platform takes growing cut of revenue
- Terms that grant perpetual content rights

## Alternative Design Principles

### Relationship-Centered
Design around relationships, not content:
- Who matters to you, not what's trending
- Quality of connection, not quantity of followers
- Conversations, not broadcasts
- Trust circles, not public squares

### User-Sovereign
You own your data, connections, and experience:
- Export everything anytime
- Choose what's shared with whom
- Control your own algorithm (or turn it off)
- Leave without losing your network

### Attention-Respecting
Protect users' time and focus:
- No infinite scroll; natural endpoints
- Notification batching, not interruption
- "Time well spent" metrics
- Features that help you disengage

### Value-Aligned
Business model aligned with user benefit:
- Subscription over advertising
- No incentive to addict or manipulate
- Success measured by user flourishing
- Transparent about trade-offs

## The Elohim Approach

The Social Medium epic designs platforms that embody these principles:

### Personal AI Mediation
Your Elohim helps you navigate:
- Filters content according to your values
- Protects you from manipulation
- Maintains relationships proactively
- Represents you when you're not present

### Distributed Infrastructure
No single company controls the network:
- Holochain: each community hosts its own
- Interoperability between communities
- Data stays with users, not platforms
- Governance by communities, not shareholders

### Trust-Based Curation
Content visibility based on trust networks:
- See content from people you trust
- Trust propagates through networks
- Manipulation is visible and addressable
- Communities set their own norms

## For Policy Makers: Regulating Platforms

Current regulation struggles with platforms:
- Section 230 debates miss the design question
- Privacy laws don't address attention extraction
- Antitrust focuses on competition, not harm
- Content moderation is symptom, not cause

Better approaches:
- Mandate data portability and interoperability
- Require algorithmic transparency
- Tax attention extraction (not just data collection)
- Support alternative ownership models

## For Developers: Building Different

Technical choices embed values:
- Centralized vs. distributed architecture
- Advertising vs. subscription business models
- Engagement vs. wellbeing metrics
- Proprietary vs. interoperable protocols

You can build differently. The Elohim Protocol shows how.

## For Influencers: Your Complicity and Power

You benefit from and suffer under current platforms:
- Reach depends on algorithmic favor
- Success requires playing engagement games
- Your audience is not really yours

But you also have power:
- Your audience follows you, not just platforms
- You can demand better terms
- You can support alternative platforms
- You can model different relationships with audiences
