Scenario: State development policy outcomes versus promises
    Given state legislature passed developer-backed "affordable housing" law
    And promised it would increase affordable housing supply
    When the Observer tracks actual outcomes three years later
    Then analysis shows: luxury housing increased 40%
    And affordable housing decreased 8%
    And displacement accelerated in gentrifying neighborhoods
    And policy delivered opposite of promised outcomes
    And evidence supports policy reform not developer rhetoric
