Scenario: Preparing community for potential authoritarian resistance
    Given authoritarian threat to protocol might emerge
    And I plan for protecting community sovereignty
    When I establish contingency plans for resistance
    Then we maintain: encrypted backups of community data
    And we prepare: mesh networking for internet disruption
    And we identify: sanctuary partners (university, churches)
    And we plan: civil disobedience protocols if needed
    And we retain: community fork option as last resort
    And we hope: never to use these
    And we know: community sovereignty matters more than protocol uniformity
