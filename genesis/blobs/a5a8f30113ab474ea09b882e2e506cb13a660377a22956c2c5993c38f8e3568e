Scenario: Navigating student-resident tensions in shared neighborhood
    Given long-term residents might resent student noise, parties, or turnover
    And students might be unaware of neighborhood norms
    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates student-resident relationships
    Then it should educate students about neighborhood expectations
    And it should help residents recognize students as temporary but real members
    And it should facilitate communication between students and long-term residents
    And it should build understanding across different neighborhood groups
    And the system should reduce student-resident conflict
    And mixed neighborhoods should be navigable for all residents
