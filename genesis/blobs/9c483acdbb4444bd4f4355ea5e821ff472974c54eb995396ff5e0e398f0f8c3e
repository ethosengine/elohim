Scenario: Community care tokens enable resource access for families
    Given Sarah has accumulated care tokens through parenting and civic participation
    And community resources are allocated partially based on care economy
    When Sarah's family needs community support
    Then her care tokens should give standing in resource decisions
    And the community should provide support based on her contributions
    And care economy should enable reciprocity between family and community
    And those who contribute care should receive care in return
    And the system should create sustainable community mutual aid
    And parenting contributions should translate to community support
