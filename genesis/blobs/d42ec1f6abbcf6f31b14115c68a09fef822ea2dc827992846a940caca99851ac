Scenario: Parent tracks special education compliance
    Given the parent's child has IEP for learning disability
    And required support services aren't being provided
    When the parent reviews Observer's special education tracking
    Then they see federal law mandates these services
    And understand district is violating child's legal rights
    And learn process for filing compliance complaint
    And connect with other special education parents
    And district cannot quietly violate disability rights
