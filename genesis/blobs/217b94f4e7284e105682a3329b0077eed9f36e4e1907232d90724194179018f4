Scenario: Connecting with workers across food service industry
    Given food service workers face similar exploitation patterns
    And collective action requires cross-workplace organization
    When I want to connect with other food service workers
    Then the protocol should facilitate industry-wide worker networks
    And help me find worker organizing groups and unions
    And support building solidarity across restaurants and food businesses
    And enable coordination for industry-level advocacy
