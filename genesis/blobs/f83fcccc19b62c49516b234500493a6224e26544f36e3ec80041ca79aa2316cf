Scenario: Accessing community healthcare and support services
    Given my low wages make healthcare and services unaffordable
    And community provides sliding-scale or care-economy-based services
    When I need healthcare, mental health support, or other services
    Then the protocol should connect me to accessible community resources
    And facilitate payment based on my care economy participation
    And recognize that workers deserve healthcare regardless of income
    And support building community care infrastructure
