Scenario: Rebuilding self-concept after trauma and loss
    Given my sense of self has been damaged by abuse and crisis
    And I struggle with self-blame and internalized stigma
    When I engage with the Value Scanner over time
    Then the system consistently reflects my worth and capability
    And makes visible my substantial care contributions
    And celebrates my strengths and achievements
    And reframes "survival" as sophisticated, valuable work
    And counters stigmatizing narratives about people in crisis
    And my personal_agent provides affirming, non-judgmental support
    And the care economy recognizes me as valuable community member
    And I see evidence of my competence and contributions
