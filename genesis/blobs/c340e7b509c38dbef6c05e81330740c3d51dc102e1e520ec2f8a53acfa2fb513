Scenario: Teaching younger generations about resource conservation
    Given Margaret has decades of conservation knowledge
    And younger generations need sustainable living skills
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates knowledge sharing
    Then Margaret should teach conservation practices
    And her knowledge should be transmitted to younger people
    And teaching should be recognized as ecological care contribution
    And intergenerational knowledge transfer should strengthen sustainability
    And senior wisdom should inform bioregional practices
    And ecological education should flow from elder experience
