Scenario: Research on council effectiveness includes my service
    Given Dr. Chen studies national council deliberations
    And my service contributes to understanding democratic AI governance
    When my deliberations become research data (anonymized)
    Then researchers learn: how citizens grapple with complexity
    And they analyze: what enables effective sortition governance
    And they examine: whether democratic oversight scales successfully
    And they identify: improvements to support future councils
    And my service: advances global knowledge of democratic governance
    And I contribute: to humanity's understanding of how to govern with AI
    And my unlikely journey: from nurse to constitutional architect serves future generations
