Scenario: Understanding ingredient sourcing and bioregional food
    Given my restaurant uses ingredients from various sources
    And some may be local/seasonal while others are industrial/imported
    When I want to understand food sourcing
    Then the protocol should provide information about ingredient origins
    And help me understand bioregional vs. industrial food systems
    And recognize that bioregional food supports local ecology and economy
    And build consciousness about care economy implications of sourcing
