Scenario: Journalist fact-checks employer claims during union campaign
    Given workers organize union at major retailer
    And employer makes claims about wages and benefits
    When the Observer provides instant fact-checking against labor data
    Then the journalist verifies wage claim is misleading (includes management)
    And finds actual frontline worker wages below poverty level
    And shows benefits exclude most workers due to hour restrictions
    And identifies employer's union-busting expenditures
    And publishes real-time fact-check supporting informed worker vote
