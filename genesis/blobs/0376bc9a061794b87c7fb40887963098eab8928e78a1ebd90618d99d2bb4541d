Scenario: Family emergency response across distance
    Given family emergencies can occur while Kenji is at school
    And he may need to return home or provide remote support
    When family crisis occurs (illness, accident, death)
    Then the family_elohim should coordinate crisis response
    And it should help Kenji balance academic obligations with family needs
    And it should facilitate his care contributions from distance if he can't travel
    And it should connect him to campus support if family crisis affects his functioning
    And the system should recognize family crisis impact on student
    And emergency coordination should include geographically distant students
