Scenario: Voice-primary interface adapts to cognitive and physical limitations
    Given Helen has difficulty with small text and complex navigation
    And her mobility makes precise touch targets challenging
    When Helen opens the Value Scanner application
    Then the interface should use voice-primary interaction
    And visual elements should have large fonts and high contrast
    And touch targets should be large and forgiving
    And navigation should be simple with minimal steps
    And the pace should be slow with no time pressure
    And error recovery should be patient and supportive
    And the interface should preserve Helen's dignity throughout
