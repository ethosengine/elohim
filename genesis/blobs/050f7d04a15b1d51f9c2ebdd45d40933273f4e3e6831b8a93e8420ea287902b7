Scenario: Bioregional investment network coordinates across municipal boundaries
    Given ecological systems transcend political boundaries
    And Patricia's investments operate within watershed and foodshed, not just municipality
    When community investment coordinates bioregionally across municipalities
    Then capital flows to support bioregional food system (farms across multiple counties)
    And watershed protection is coordinated across jurisdictions
    And bioregional economic development transcends municipal fragmentation
    And ecological coordination enables systemic sustainability
    And bioregional_elohim facilitates cross-jurisdictional investment coordination
