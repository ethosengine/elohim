Scenario: Building relationships with neighbors over time
    Given Jordan lives on the same block as many families
    And Jordan walks past neighbors' homes daily
    When Jordan encounters neighbors during daily activities
    Then Jordan greets neighbors with friendliness
    And the personal_agent might provide name reminders if Jordan forgets
    And neighbors increasingly see Jordan as a person, not just disability
    And Jordan develops reputation as the "friendly neighbor"
    And simple conversations build relationship over time
    And Jordan's social contribution to neighborhood is real and valued
    And Jordan experiences genuine community connection
