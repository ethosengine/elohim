Scenario: Multigenerational household coordination when elderly live with family
    Given some families have Helen living with adult children
    And multigenerational households have complex dynamics
    When household governance includes elderly family member
    Then the family_elohim should mediate competing needs
    And Helen's needs should be balanced with other household members
    And her voice should be heard in household decisions
    And privacy should be maintained for all generations
    And care should be coordinated without overwhelming household
    And the protocol should support healthy multigenerational living
    And all family members' flourishing should be considered
