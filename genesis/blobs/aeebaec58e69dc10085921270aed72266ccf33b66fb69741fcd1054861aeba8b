    Given Maria's single income must support household of four
    And she struggles to afford school fees, field trips, sports, and activities
    When schools require fees or activity payments
    Then the educational_elohim should connect Maria to fee assistance programs
    And schools should provide cost support without stigmatizing single-parent families
    And all children should access educational opportunities regardless of single-parent economics
    And fee assistance should be available and accessible
    And Maria's children should participate fully without financial exclusion
