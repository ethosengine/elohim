Scenario: Participating in neighborhood care economy with limited resources
    Given Kenji has severe resource constraints
    And he cannot contribute financially to neighborhood projects
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks care contributions
    Then it should recognize non-financial contributions Kenji can make
    And it should value his labor, time, and presence
    And it should show "Kenji helped neighbor carry groceries: 2 care tokens"
    And participation should not require money
    And the system should enable care economy participation at all resource levels
    And students should contribute to neighborhood based on capacity
