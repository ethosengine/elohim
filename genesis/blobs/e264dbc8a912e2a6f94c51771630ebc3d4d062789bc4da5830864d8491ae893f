Scenario: Family care legacy and intergenerational learning
    Given Sarah learned caregiving from her own parents
    And she is teaching care practices to Tommy and Emma
    When the family_elohim tracks intergenerational patterns
    Then it should recognize care legacy across generations
    And it should show how care practices are transmitted
    And it should value Sarah's role in teaching next generation
    And intergenerational care knowledge should be recognized
    And the system should support positive care culture transmission
    And family care economy should build across generations
