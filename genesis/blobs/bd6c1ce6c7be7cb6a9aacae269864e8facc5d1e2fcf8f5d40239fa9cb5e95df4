Scenario: Teacher tracks contract implementation and enforcement
    Given union contract includes working condition provisions
    But contract enforcement is inconsistent across schools
    When the Observer monitors contract implementation
    Then teachers document where contract is violated (planning time, class sizes, duties)
    And patterns show which administrators ignore contract provisions
    And union identifies systemic enforcement gaps vs isolated violations
    And brings accountability data to district and grievance process
    And contract becomes enforceable through transparency
