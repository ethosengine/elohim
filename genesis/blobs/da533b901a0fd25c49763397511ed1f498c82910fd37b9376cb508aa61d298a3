Scenario: Learning from diverse national approaches to protocol
    Given different nations implemented protocol differently
    And cultural context shapes governance outcomes
    When I study international variations in implementation
    Then I learn: from collectivist societies' community emphasis
    And I examine: how different political systems integrate protocol
    And I identify: universal patterns vs context-specific adaptations
    And I share: lessons with other policy makers
    And I adapt: my legislation based on international evidence
    And I contribute: to global learning community
    And I practice: epistemic humility about cultural diversity
