Scenario: Serving on Regional Council with greater complexity and time
    Given I was selected for Regional Constitutional Council
    And this layer handles escalated appeals and novel situations
    When I begin my 4-month term meeting twice weekly
    Then I review: cases that couldn't be resolved at community layer
    And I deliberate: complex constitutional questions affecting region
    And I create: precedent influencing multiple communities
    And I work with: citizens from diverse communities across region
    And I receive: enhanced training for greater responsibility
    And I am compensated: for significant time commitment
    And I feel: weight of creating regional constitutional law
