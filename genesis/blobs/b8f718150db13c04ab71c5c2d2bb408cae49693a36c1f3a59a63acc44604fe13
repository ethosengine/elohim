Scenario: Activist connects community issue to citywide pattern
    Given the activist is fighting playground neglect locally
    When the Observer shows citywide park maintenance data
    Then the activist sees systematic under-investment in certain neighborhoods
    And identifies which communities face similar conditions
    And connects local organizing to citywide advocacy
    And frames individual grievance as structural injustice
    And builds power through pattern recognition
