Scenario: Family privacy protected while coordinating across contexts
    Given family care economy involves multiple family members
    And privacy needs differ across individuals
    When family data is managed
    Then Sarah should control what's shared with extended family
    And children's privacy should be protected by parental oversight
    And partner's privacy should be respected
    And extended family should only see what Sarah chooses to share
    And family privacy should be complex, nuanced, and protected
