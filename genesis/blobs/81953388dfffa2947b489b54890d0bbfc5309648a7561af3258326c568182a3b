Scenario: Ethical data practices respecting community sovereignty
    Given I am studying Riverside residents and their governance
    And I have access to sensitive information about their lives
    When I conduct research following ethical protocols
    Then I obtain: informed consent from all research participants
    And I ensure: anonymization and privacy protection in publications
    And I provide: community review of findings before publication (for accuracy)
    And I share: research benefits with Riverside (payments support community fund)
    And I respect: community right to revoke access if research becomes harmful
    And I practice: research ethics aligned with dignity principles protocol embodies
    And My methodology demonstrates: how to study communities without extracting from them
