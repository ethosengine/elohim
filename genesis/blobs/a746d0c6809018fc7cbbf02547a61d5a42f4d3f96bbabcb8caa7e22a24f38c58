Scenario: Household health management while providing care
    Given both Margaret and Robert have health considerations
    And Margaret's care work requires physical and mental energy
    When the household_elohim monitors health impacts
    Then it should track whether care work affects Margaret's health
    And it should ensure both partners maintain health appointments and self-care
    And it should alert if care burden is compromising well-being
    And household health should be prioritized alongside care provision
    And both partners should support each other's health management
    And the system should enable sustainable care without health sacrifice
