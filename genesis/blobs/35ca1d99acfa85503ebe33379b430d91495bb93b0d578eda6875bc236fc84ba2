Scenario: Alex's chosen family recognized alongside biological family
    Given Alex may have close relationships in disability community
    And chosen family might be more supportive than biological family
    When the family_elohim defines family relationships
    Then it should include Alex's chosen family members
    And disability community bonds should be recognized as family
    And care flows with chosen family should be tracked and valued
    And Alex should be able to define their own family
    And the protocol should honor diverse family structures
    And biological family should not be privileged over chosen family
    And Alex's full support network should be acknowledged
