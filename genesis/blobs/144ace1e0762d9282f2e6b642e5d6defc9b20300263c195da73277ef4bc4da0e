Scenario: Unsuccessful appeal but protocol transparency builds trust
    Given my appeal was reviewed and the agent's decision was affirmed
    And I didn't get the outcome I wanted
    When I receive the Constitutional Council's detailed reasoning
    Then I can see that my appeal was genuinely considered not dismissed
    And I understand the constitutional principles that were applied
    And I see how my case compares to similar precedents
    And I know I had meaningful recourse even though I didn't prevail
    And The transparency helps me trust the process even in defeat
    And Trust in community governance is maintained through honest engagement
