Scenario: Developer prevailing wage compliance gains monitoring
    Given a developer receives public subsidy requiring prevailing wage
    And claims compliance with wage requirements
    When the Observer monitors wage compliance
    Then analysis shows: certified payroll reports show prevailing wage
    But worker interviews reveal unpaid overtime and deductions
    And actual take-home pay is below prevailing wage requirements
    And compliance on paper differs from worker reality
    And enforcement mechanisms need worker-centered monitoring
