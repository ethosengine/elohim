Scenario: Teacher provides evidence on class size policy
    Given the board is considering budget cuts increasing class sizes
    And board claims research shows class size doesn't matter
    When teachers coordinate evidence-based advocacy through Observer
    Then they present district's own data showing outcomes decline as sizes increase
    And cite research on class size effects by grade level
    And show neighboring district has lower ratios and better results
    And provide teacher professional judgment grounded in evidence
    And board decision becomes informed by multiple evidence sources
