Scenario: Parent tracks playground repair commitments
    Given the community council promised playground equipment repairs in 60 days
    And the parent reported broken equipment their child uses
    When 60 days pass without repairs being completed
    Then the Observer alerts the parent about the missed deadline
    And provides evidence from the original meeting commitment
    And facilitates coordinated follow-up with other affected parents
    And institutional memory extends beyond administrator turnover
    And accountability prevents promises from being forgotten
