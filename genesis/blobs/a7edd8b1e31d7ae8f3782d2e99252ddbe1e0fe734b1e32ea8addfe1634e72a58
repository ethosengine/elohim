Scenario: Building resilience through care economy participation
    Given Kenji faces significant stress and uncertainty
    And he is geographically separated from family support networks
    When the personal_agent supports Kenji's resilience development
    Then it should recognize his participation in care economy as building connection
    And it should show how his care contributions create community
    And it should validate that resilience comes from reciprocal relationships
    And the agent should help him build care networks in temporary community
    And the system should teach that care economy creates security
    And Kenji should learn that giving and receiving care builds resilience
