Scenario: Successful national appeal leads to protocol version update
    Given my appeal revealed fundamental flaw in agent reasoning
    And National Constitutional Council ordered protocol correction
    When Protocol Research Council develops fix
    Then new protocol version addresses constitutional violation
    And All communities receive update recommendation with explanation
    And Communities can adopt update at their own pace (sovereignty respected)
    And My individual appeal improved protocol for millions globally
    And Constitutional governance drives continuous protocol improvement
    And Individual recourse and systemic excellence are mutually reinforcing
