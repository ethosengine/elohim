Scenario: Crisis detection preserves autonomy while ensuring safety
    Given Helen lives alone with family and community support
    And she is at risk for falls and medication errors
    When the system detects potential crisis indicators
    Then safety monitoring should occur without surveillance feeling
    And alerts should go to Helen first when appropriate
    And emergency contacts should be notified only when necessary
    And intervention should preserve her agency: "Helen, you haven't moved in a while. Are you okay?"
    And she should be consulted before family is contacted when possible
    And safety should enhance autonomy, not replace it
    And the system should balance protection with dignity
