Scenario: Municipal financial institutions develop community investment products
    Given banks and credit unions lack experience with democratic business investment
    And institutional support would scale community investment dramatically
    When Patricia and other investors demonstrate model viability
    Then local banks develop community investment accounts and funds
    And credit unions prioritize democratic business lending
    And financial institutions see community investment as sound business opportunity
    And municipal policy supports financial institution democratic business focus
    And municipality_elohim coordinates with financial institutions on product development
