Scenario: Municipal policy integration with protocol decisions
    Given city council passes new housing affordability ordinance
    And Municipal Elohim flags potential conflict with property protocols
    When conflict is identified
    Then Constitutional Council reviews constitutional alignment
    And council determines whether ordinance or protocol needs adjustment
    And Jamal facilitates resolution through democratic deliberation
    And city retains policy sovereignty within constitutional bounds
    And agents and elected government work as partners
