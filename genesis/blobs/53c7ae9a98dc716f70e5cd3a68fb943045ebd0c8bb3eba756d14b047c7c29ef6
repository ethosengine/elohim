Scenario: Parent advocates for safe routes to school infrastructure
    Given the parent's child walks to school along unsafe streets
    And lacks sidewalks and safe crossings for two blocks
    When the parent reviews municipal transportation budget
    Then they see $4M allocated for downtown streetscape improvements
    And learn zero dollars budgeted for school route safety
    And connect with other parents whose children walk same routes
    And present coordinated testimony at city council meeting
    And municipal infrastructure priorities include children's safety
