Scenario: Citizen detects politician voting pattern inconsistency
    Given a council member claims to support affordable housing
    And the citizen cares about housing affordability
    When the Observer tracks voting records over time
    Then the citizen sees the council member voted against 5 housing measures
    And approved tax breaks for luxury development
    And observes patterns vs rhetoric divergence
    And can hold officials accountable in elections
    And political theater becomes visible
