Scenario: Elder protected from Medicare scam
    Given scammers are running fake Medicare enrollment campaigns
    When a scammer tries to contact Rose about "urgent" Medicare changes
    And the message requests personal information and payment
    Then the guardian agent identifies the scam pattern
    And the fraudulent message never reaches Rose
    And Rose is protected without awareness of the threat
    And legitimate Medicare communications work normally
    And her real healthcare connections remain intact
