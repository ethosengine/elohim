Scenario: Being recognized for work contributions publicly
    Given the library celebrates Employee Appreciation Week
    And all staff members are recognized for their contributions
    When Jordan is recognized for their work
    Then the recognition celebrates Jordan's genuine contributions
    And Jordan is honored as a valued employee, not a charity case
    And specific accomplishments are named (not just "trying hard")
    And Jordan's work helping organize library is highlighted
    And Jordan experiences authentic professional recognition
    And colleagues see Jordan as contributing peer
    And Jordan's worker identity is affirmed and celebrated
