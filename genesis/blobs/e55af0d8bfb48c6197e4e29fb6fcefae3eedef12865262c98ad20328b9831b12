Scenario: Organizing around food worker food insecurity
    Given food service workers often cannot afford adequate food despite preparing food
    When this contradiction becomes visible
    Then the protocol should help organize around food worker food security
    And advocate for meal provisions as standard for food workers
    And push for wages that enable workers to afford quality food
    And make visible the injustice of hungry people feeding others
