Scenario: Using research evidence to justify protocol support
    Given I need to defend protocol against skeptical colleagues
    And Dr. Chen's research provides rigorous evaluation
    When I cite evidence in committee hearings
    Then I present: data showing reduced loneliness and improved wellbeing
    And I provide: evidence about successful crisis response
    And I demonstrate: marginalized community access patterns
    And I show: comparison with communities without protocol
    And I address: limitations and challenges honestly
    And evidence base: supports informed policy choice
    And I maintain: scientific credibility through honest assessment
