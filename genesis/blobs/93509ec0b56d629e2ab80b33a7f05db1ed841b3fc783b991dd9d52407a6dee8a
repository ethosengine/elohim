Scenario: Track how Riverside community evolves over 10 years
    Given Riverside adopted protocol in Year 1 of study
    When James returns annually to measure changes
    Then he tracks wellbeing indicators over full decade
    And he documents how trust builds incrementally not instantaneously
    And he observes how civic participation increases over time
    And he identifies challenges that emerge only after years of operation
    And he captures transformation that short-term studies miss
    And longitudinal design reveals cumulative effects
