Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent
  As a single parent participating in community care economy
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to access community resources based on care contributions, not charity
  So that I receive dignified support for my superhuman care work without stigma

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the single parent user "Maria" is registered in the system
    And Maria performs extraordinary care labor as sole parent of three children
    And she earns $42k/year supporting household of four
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim coordinates community-level care economy
    And community includes mutual aid networks, support organizations, and resources

  Scenario: Care token standing qualifies Maria for community support without means-testing
    Given Maria has accumulated substantial care tokens from solo parenting work
    And she needs access to community resources due to resource constraints
    When Maria seeks community support
    Then her care contributions should qualify her for support with dignity
    And support should be based on demonstrated care work, not proving neediness
    And Maria should access resources as care economy participant, not charity recipient
    And community support should recognize her contributions, not pity her circumstances
    And care economy should frame assistance as reciprocity, not welfare

  Scenario: Single parent mutual aid network provides peer support and resources
    Given Maria shares specific challenges with other single parents
    And they can support each other in ways non-single-parents cannot
    When Maria connects to community single parent networks
    Then the community_elohim should facilitate single parent mutual aid
    And it should coordinate resource sharing specific to solo parenting needs
    And it should enable peer support among those with lived experience
    And single parent network should provide understanding and practical help
    And Maria should have community that truly comprehends solo parenting reality

  Scenario: Food security support accessed with dignity through care economy
    Given Maria's $175/week grocery budget for four people is severely constrained
    And food security is essential for family well-being
    When Maria's economic status qualifies her for food support
    Then the community_elohim should connect her to food assistance programs
    And support should be framed as care economy reciprocity, not charity
    And Maria should access help without stigmatizing means-testing processes
    And her massive care contributions should be recognized as qualifying her for support
    And food assistance should be dignified and adequate for family needs

  Scenario: Emergency financial assistance during crisis without bureaucratic humiliation
    Given single parents face financial emergencies without partner backup
    And traditional assistance requires invasive documentation and waiting
    When Maria faces financial crisis—medical bill, car repair, unexpected expense
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate rapid emergency assistance
    And help should be available quickly based on care economy standing
    And Maria should not have to prove desperation through bureaucratic gauntlet
    And emergency support should preserve dignity while providing real help
    And care economy should function as community safety net for crisis

  Scenario: Childcare assistance coordination without formal program barriers
    Given Maria cannot afford formal childcare for three children
    And she needs flexible care support for work, emergencies, and sustainability
    When Maria needs childcare assistance
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate community childcare support
    And it should connect her to subsidized programs without bureaucratic barriers
    And it should facilitate informal care networks for flexible needs
    And childcare support should be adequate and appropriate for her family
    And Maria should access care help needed for solo parent survival

  Scenario: School supply and activity assistance for children's participation
    Given Maria struggles to afford school supplies, field trips, and activities
    And she wants her children to participate fully despite budget constraints
    When school-related expenses arise
    Then the community_elohim should connect Maria to school assistance programs
    And support should enable her children's full educational participation
    And assistance should be provided without stigmatizing her family
    And children should not be excluded from opportunities due to single-parent economics
    And Maria should be able to provide for her children's education with community support

  Scenario: Community advocacy elevates single parent issues to policy level
    Given single parents face systemic barriers and lack political visibility
    And policy changes could dramatically improve their circumstances
    When Maria participates in community advocacy
    Then the community_elohim should amplify single parent voices
    And it should provide care economy data showing scale of solo parent contributions
    And it should help Maria advocate for single-parent-friendly policies
    And community should recognize single parents as care economy heroes, not broken families
    And advocacy should push for systemic changes in housing, childcare, wages, and support

  Scenario: Preventing single parent burnout through community monitoring
    Given Maria operates at unsustainable intensity with no co-parent relief
    And burnout is extremely common among solo parents
    When the community_elohim monitors Maria's well-being
    Then it should detect warning signs of approaching burnout
    And it should proactively offer respite care and support
    And it should coordinate community intervention before crisis occurs
    And burnout prevention should be community responsibility
    And Maria should have community safety net watching for her well-being

  Scenario: Community resource directory tailored to single parent needs
    Given Maria needs to know about available resources but has no time to research
    And single parents have specific resource needs different from partnered families
    When Maria seeks community resources
    Then the community_elohim should provide tailored resource directory
    And it should highlight programs specifically supporting single parents
    And it should filter for her family size, income level, and location
    And resource discovery should be efficient, not an exhausting research project
    And Maria should easily find help available to her without extensive searching

  Scenario: Skill-building and education support for economic advancement
    Given Maria is stuck in low-wage medical assistant work
    And she wants to advance economically but has no time or resources for education
    When Maria seeks opportunities for economic advancement
    Then the community_elohim should connect her to education and training programs
    And it should identify programs compatible with single parent constraints
    And it should help her access support for education costs and childcare during training
    And skill-building should be realistic pathway to better wages
    And Maria should have community support for economic mobility despite solo parent limitations

  Scenario: Single parent household recognized in community leadership
    Given Maria's care contributions are extraordinary
    And she deserves voice in community governance despite time constraints
    When community leadership positions are filled
    Then Maria's quantified care work should be visible qualification
    And her solo parenting should be recognized as demonstrated community commitment
    And community should make leadership accessible to time-constrained parents
    And single parents should have governance voice proportionate to care contributions
    And Maria should be valued as community leader, not marginalized as struggling victim

  Scenario: Community challenges single-parent stigma through visibility
    Given society often views single-parent families as deficient or problematic
    And this stigma harms Maria and her children
    When community care economy makes single parents' work visible
    Then it should demonstrate that solo parents provide extraordinary care value
    And it should challenge deficit narratives about single-parent families
    And it should reframe single parents as care economy heroes deserving support
    And community should actively combat stigma through recognition and respect
    And Maria should experience community validation, not judgment

  Scenario: Community privacy protects Maria's dignity while enabling support
    Given Maria needs community support but also privacy protection
    And some aspects of her situation are sensitive and personal
    When Maria participates in community care economy
    Then the community_elohim should only share what Maria consents to
    And her household details should remain private unless she chooses to disclose
    And support access should not require invasive disclosure
    And privacy should be protected even while receiving community assistance
    And Maria should maintain dignity and control over personal information
