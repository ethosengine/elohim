Scenario: Peer collaboration framed as care economy practice
    Given Jasmine collaborates with classmates on group projects
    And peer learning is valuable educational practice
    When educational_elohim tracks collaborative learning
    Then it should frame peer collaboration as care economy
    And recognize that students teaching each other is care work
    And value collaborative learning as mutual care
    And help students understand that knowledge sharing creates collective value
    And build expectation that learning is community practice, not individual competition
    And demonstrate care economy principles in educational contexts
