    Given Robert serves on municipal boards and commissions
    And civic participation is care for community
    And his service benefits all residents

    Then it should recognize his municipal service as care contribution
    And value civic participation in care token economy
    And track his contributions: planning commission, park board, aging advisory committee
    And demonstrate that governance participation is care work
    And recognize that his civic service strengthens municipal care economy
    And build culture where civic participation is valued as contribution
    And support sustainable civic engagement without exploitation
