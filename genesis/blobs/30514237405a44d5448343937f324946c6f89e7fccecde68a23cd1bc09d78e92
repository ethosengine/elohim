Scenario: Fair pricing enables transition from extractive to regenerative agriculture
    Given corporate food system made regenerative practices financially impossible
    And Tom wanted to build soil health but thin margins prevented investment
    When democratic network pays sustainability premium for regenerative practices
    Then crop rotation becomes economically viable through diversified revenue
    And cover cropping is compensated as soil-building investment
    And reduced tillage practices are supported despite initial yield reduction
    And regenerative agriculture is profitable, not costly burden
