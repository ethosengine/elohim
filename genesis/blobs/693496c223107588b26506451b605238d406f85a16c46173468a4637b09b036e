Scenario: Neighborhood watch supports elderly safety with dignity
    Given Helen is vulnerable to scams and exploitation
    And neighborhood watch includes elder protection
    When potential threats are identified
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should alert Helen and support network
    And protection should be provided without infantilizing
    And Helen should be informed: "Neighbors are seeing scam calls in the area"
    And her autonomy should be preserved while providing protection
    And neighborhood should look out for vulnerable members
    And safety should be communal responsibility
    And the protocol should enable neighborhood care without surveillance
