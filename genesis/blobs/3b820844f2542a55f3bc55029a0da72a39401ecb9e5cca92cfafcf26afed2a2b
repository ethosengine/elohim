Scenario: Lifetime environmental observations inform climate data
    Given Helen has observed local environmental changes over 8+ decades
    And her memory includes baseline data from pre-industrial era
    When Helen shares environmental observations
    Then her knowledge should be captured for ecological archives
    And her observations should inform local climate understanding
    And personal experience should be valued alongside scientific data
    And care tokens should reflect her contribution to environmental knowledge
    And the protocol should recognize elders as environmental historians
    And Helen's lifetime of observation should contribute to bioregional stewardship
    And indigenous elder knowledge methods should inform data collection
