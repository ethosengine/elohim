Scenario: Journalist develops teacher sources on unsafe conditions
    Given teachers report unsafe building conditions
    And fear retaliation for speaking publicly
    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel
    Then teachers share evidence of mold, failing HVAC, and structural issues
    And journalist investigates without exposing individual sources
    And verifies claims through building inspection records
    And documents district knowledge and inaction
    And publishes investigation forcing accountability
    And source protection enables teachers to speak truth
