Scenario: Learning sustainable practices within budget constraints
    Given Aisha wants to be environmentally responsible
    And she has limited financial resources
    When the personal_agent teaches sustainability
    Then education should address real budget limitations
    And it should teach affordable sustainable practices
    And it should explain trade-offs between cost and environmental impact
    And sustainability education should be practical, not preachy
    And she should learn to make values-aligned choices within constraints
    And environmental literacy should respect economic reality
