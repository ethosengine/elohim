Scenario: Intergenerational knowledge transfer through elder mentoring
    Given younger generations lack knowledge Helen possesses
    And intergenerational learning benefits all participants
    When Helen mentors grandchildren or community youth
    Then her teaching should be facilitated by educational systems
    And younger learners should be connected to elder mentors
    And Helen should be recognized as educator, not just "nice grandma"
    And care tokens should reflect her teaching work
    And the protocol should coordinate intergenerational learning
    And educational value should flow in both directions
    And youth should learn to value elder wisdom
