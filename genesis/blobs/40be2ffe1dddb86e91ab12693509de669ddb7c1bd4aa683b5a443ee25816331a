Scenario: Engaging community-level sustainability initiatives
    Given the community has environmental goals
    And collective action is more effective than individual
    When Aisha participates in community sustainability projects
    Then the community_elohim should coordinate her involvement
    And it should connect her to composting, recycling, or energy programs
    And her environmental care work should be recognized
    And community-scale sustainability should be facilitated
    And the system should enable collective environmental stewardship
    And ecological care should build community bonds
