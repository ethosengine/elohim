Scenario: Receiving workplace accommodations as right, not favor
    Given Jordan needs extra time to learn new library procedures
    And reasonable accommodations are legally required
    When new cataloging software is introduced
    Then the library provides extended training time for Jordan
    And instruction is adapted to Jordan's learning style
    And accommodations are provided matter-of-factly, not begrudgingly
    And Jordan's right to accessibility is honored
    And Jordan can perform job with appropriate support
    And Jordan experiences workplace inclusion through accommodation
