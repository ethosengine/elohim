Scenario: Accessing informal neighborhood support during acute crisis
    Given I am experiencing acute crisis (no food, utility shutoff, safety emergency)
    And I need immediate neighborhood-level support
    When crisis requires rapid local response
    Then the Value Scanner connects me to immediate neighborhood resources
    And identifies neighbors who've offered emergency support
    And facilitates rapid requests for help through care economy network
    And helps me access emergency assistance without shame
    And validates that asking for crisis help is appropriate
    And my personal_agent surfaces most appropriate immediate resources
    And recognizes that everyone experiences crises requiring community support
    And ensures rapid connection to neighborhood mutual aid
