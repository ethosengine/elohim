Scenario: Citizen verifies municipal service delivery claims
    Given city officials claim streets are maintained equitably
    And the citizen's neighborhood has persistent potholes
    When the Observer tracks service delivery patterns
    Then the citizen sees which neighborhoods receive infrastructure investment
    And compares response times across different areas
    And identifies disparities in municipal services
    And presents evidence for accountability demands
    And equitable service delivery becomes measurable
