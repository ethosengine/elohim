Scenario: Community future planning supports caregiver sustainability
    Given James's caregiving could last years or decades
    And he needs to build future care economy resources
    When James plans for long-term sustainability
    Then the community_elohim should track his accumulating care contributions
    And his care tokens should build toward future when he may need care
    And community should recognize caregiving as investment in mutual aid
    And care economy should function across decades, not just immediate needs
    And James should build care economy standing for his own future vulnerability
