Scenario: Community advocacy for senior issues and care economy
    Given Margaret understands both care economy and senior needs
    And community policy affects senior quality of life
    When the community_elohim supports advocacy efforts
    Then Margaret should be connected to senior advocacy
    And her voice should inform policy on retirement, care, and aging
    And care economy principles should be advanced through advocacy
    And seniors should organize for systemic change
    And Margaret's generation could reshape retirement policy
    And political power should be built through care economy visibility
