Scenario: Research on protocol as global existential risk mitigation
    Given superintelligent AI poses existential risk to humanity
    And I study whether democratic governance can address this risk
    When I analyze protocol as existential risk mitigation strategy
    Then I examine: whether constitutional accountability reduces AI risk
    And I assess: whether sortition prevents elite capture of superintelligence
    And I explore: whether transparency enables democratic oversight at scale
    And I analyze: whether recourse mechanisms provide adaptation to unknown risks
    And I investigate: whether protocol's distributed architecture increases resilience
    And I conclude: honestly about uncertainties and limitations
    And My research informs: humanity's response to its most important challenge
