Scenario: Community care infrastructure advocacy based on user needs
    Given Robert uses community care services and sees gaps
    And he understands what infrastructure would help families like his
    And community planning should be informed by user experience
    When community_elohim connects user experience to infrastructure planning
    Then it should channel Robert's feedback to community planning processes
    And surface gaps: "No adult day care available for aging parents in this community"
    And help him advocate for infrastructure that serves caregivers
    And connect his voice to community decision-makers
    And ensure community care systems are designed by those who use them
    And build care infrastructure based on actual caregiver needs
    And demonstrate that users should shape systems
