Scenario: Providing local context to Constitutional Council deliberations
    Given community council is reviewing appeal requiring local knowledge
    And I have information about Riverside history and circumstances
    When I testify to provide community context
    Then I explain: relevant history, cultural factors, relationships
    And I clarify: why something might seem unusual to outsiders
    And I don't advocate: for particular outcome in appeal
    And I inform: council's judgment with local wisdom
    And I respect: council's independence and authority
    And I enable: constitutional interpretation grounded in reality
    And community knowledge: enriches democratic governance
