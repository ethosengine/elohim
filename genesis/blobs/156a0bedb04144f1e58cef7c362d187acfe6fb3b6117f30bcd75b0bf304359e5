Scenario: Family understanding of student financial constraints
    Given Kenji lives on $180/week total budget
    And family might not understand severity of his constraints
    When the family_elohim shares appropriate financial context
    Then it should help family understand Kenji's resource limitations
    And it should facilitate realistic expectations for gift-giving, travel, expenses
    And it should reduce shame around financial scarcity
    And family should understand student economic reality
    And the system should bridge understanding gap about student poverty
    And realistic financial communication should strengthen family relationships
