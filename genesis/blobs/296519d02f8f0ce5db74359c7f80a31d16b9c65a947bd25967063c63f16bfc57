Scenario: Manager proposes operational changes requiring democratic approval
    Given Marcus identifies efficiency improvement opportunity
    And corporate model would have him implement changes by fiat
    When Marcus wants to implement the operational change
    Then Marcus presents proposal to worker council with clear rationale
    And workers deliberate on benefits and potential downsides
    And workers ask clarifying questions Marcus answers transparently
    And workers vote on whether to adopt the change
    And if approved, Marcus coordinates implementation
    And if rejected, Marcus accepts decision and proposes alternatives
