Scenario: Snow removal and sidewalk maintenance advocacy
    Given Alex uses a wheelchair and inaccessible sidewalks trap Alex at home
    And snow removal is often inadequate
    When winter weather creates accessibility barriers
    Then Alex should be able to document sidewalk problems systematically
    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate snow removal advocacy
    And Alex's mobility needs should be recognized as legitimate priority
    And neighbors should understand that sidewalk access is essential infrastructure
    And collective action should demand better municipal services
    And Alex's advocacy should improve conditions for all residents
    And the neighborhood should support Alex's right to mobility
