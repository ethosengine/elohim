Scenario: Local business accessibility for elderly with mobility limitations
    Given Helen needs to access local shops and services
    And her mobility limitations make some businesses inaccessible
    When the neighborhood_elohim assesses accessibility
    Then it should surface which local businesses are accessible
    And it should encourage accessibility improvements
    And it should coordinate volunteer support for inaccessible locations
    And Helen should be able to participate in neighborhood commerce
    And local economy should include elderly residents
    And the protocol should advocate for universal accessibility
    And neighborhood should adapt to enable elder participation
