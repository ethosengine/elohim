Scenario: Right to disconnect and data sovereignty maintained
    Given Marcus uses the system for critical household functions
    And constitutional constraints apply at all governance layers
    When Marcus or his family choose to disconnect
    Then the system must honor disconnection immediately
    And alternative methods for household management must remain viable
    And no dependency should be created that makes disconnection harmful
    And data sovereignty must be preserved
    And Marcus's right to not participate must be absolute
