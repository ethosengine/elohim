Scenario: Individual autonomy expanding based on demonstrated capability
    Given Emma has shown good stewardship decisions over time
    And parents can adjust autonomy levels in the system
    When Emma's decision-making patterns are reviewed
    Then her boundaries should expand to reflect capability
    And she should earn more freedom through demonstrated judgment
    And the system should track maturity indicators
    And Emma should understand that autonomy grows with responsibility
    And her increasing capability should be recognized
    And freedom should be matched to demonstrated stewardship
