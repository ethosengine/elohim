Scenario: Manager coordinates supply chain logistics while workers govern relationships
    Given workers democratically selected Johnson Farm as supplier
    And day-to-day ordering and logistics needs coordination
    When supply chain operations continue
    Then Marcus manages ordering logistics and inventory tracking
    And Marcus coordinates deliveries and quality checks
    But workers govern supplier relationship and strategic decisions
    And Marcus cannot unilaterally change suppliers or negotiate major terms
    And his coordination role enables worker governance, not replaces it
