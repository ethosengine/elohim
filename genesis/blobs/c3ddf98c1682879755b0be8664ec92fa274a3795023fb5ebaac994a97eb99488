Scenario: Household technology adapted for accessibility
    Given Helen has difficulty with complex technology
    And her home includes various devices and systems
    When household technology is configured
    Then all systems should be simplified for her access
    And voice control should be available throughout
    And large, simple controls should replace complex interfaces
    And emergency systems should be easily accessible
    And technology should serve her, not frustrate her
    And assistive devices should integrate seamlessly
    And the household should be adapted to her capabilities
