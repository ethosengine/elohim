Scenario: Shared household inventory and waste reduction
    Given four roommates buy food independently
    And lack of coordination leads to duplicate purchases and waste
    When the household_elohim manages shared inventory
    Then it should track what's in shared pantry and refrigerator
    And it should prevent duplicate buying: "You already have pasta, Maya bought it Tuesday"
    And it should identify food about to expire
    And it should suggest meals using existing ingredients
    And the system should reduce household food waste
    And coordination should save money and resources for all roommates
