Scenario: Retired residents as experienced community leaders and organizers
    Given Frank has decades of community experience
    And he understands community dynamics and history
    When the community_elohim facilitates leadership
    Then Frank's accumulated experience should position him for leadership
    And his knowledge should inform community organizing and policy
    And community should actively seek his participation in decision-making
    And decades of community investment should confer legitimate authority
    And elder leadership should be welcomed and valued
    And Frank should experience himself as community leader, not marginal participant
