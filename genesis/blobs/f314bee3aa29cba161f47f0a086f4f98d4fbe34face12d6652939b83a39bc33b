Feature: Community-Level Appeal Process for Appellant
  As an appellant in the governance system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want rapid, accessible appeals for Community Elohim decisions
  So that local governance remains responsive and accountable to community members

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the appellant user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active
    And Community Elohim provides first-layer appeal review for Family Elohim decisions

  Scenario: First-layer appeal review within 24 hours
    Given I appealed my Family Elohim's decision about mental health intervention
    When Community Elohim conducts first-layer appeal review
    Then the review happens within 24 hours of my appeal filing
    And Community Elohim examines if Family Elohim decision was appropriate for local context
    And They consider community resources available (mental health services, support networks)
    And They evaluate if local cultural norms were respected
    And They provide transparent reasoning for their review decision
    And Most appeals are resolved at this layer through clarification or correction
    And I receive immediate notification of the review outcome

  Scenario: Community Elohim identifies clear error in Family Elohim decision
    Given my Family Elohim made a decision based on incorrect data
    And I appealed pointing out the factual error
    When Community Elohim reviews the appeal
    Then they quickly identify the error in the original decision
    And The decision is immediately corrected
    And My preferences or outcomes are restored to proper state
    And Family Elohim updates its reasoning based on correct information
    And The error pattern is flagged for protocol improvement
    And I receive apology and explanation of what went wrong

  Scenario: Appeal reveals need for community-specific calibration
    Given I appeal a privacy threshold that feels too low for my community
    And multiple community members have filed similar appeals
    When Community Constitutional Council reviews the pattern
    Then they recognize this as community-wide concern not individual complaint
    And They recommend community-specific calibration of privacy thresholds
    And Community leader facilitates deliberation on local preferences
    And Community residents participate in calibrating the protocol
    And My appeal contributes to community self-governance
    And Local sovereignty is exercised within constitutional bounds

  Scenario: Appealing community resource allocation decision
    Given Community Elohim denied my small business loan application
    And I believe the criteria were unfairly applied
    When I appeal the economic decision
    Then Community Constitutional Council reviews the resource allocation
    And They evaluate if constitutional principles of care and equity were followed
    And They examine if I had meaningful opportunity to present my case
    And They consider community economic context and priorities
    And They assess if the agent's risk analysis was sound or biased
    And The appeal can result in decision reversal or modified evaluation criteria
    And Local economic priorities are clarified through appeal precedents

  Scenario: Appeal includes community context testimony
    Given I filed an appeal that requires local knowledge to understand
    And the Constitutional Council needs community context
    When Community Leader provides testimony about local circumstances
    Then the leader explains relevant history, cultural factors, and relationships
    And The context helps council understand what might seem unusual to outsiders
    And The leader doesn't advocate for outcome, just provides information
    And The council weighs local context alongside constitutional principles
    And Community knowledge enriches constitutional interpretation
    And My appeal benefits from those who understand our community deeply

  Scenario: Unsuccessful appeal but protocol transparency builds trust
    Given my appeal was reviewed and the agent's decision was affirmed
    And I didn't get the outcome I wanted
    When I receive the Constitutional Council's detailed reasoning
    Then I can see that my appeal was genuinely considered not dismissed
    And I understand the constitutional principles that were applied
    And I see how my case compares to similar precedents
    And I know I had meaningful recourse even though I didn't prevail
    And The transparency helps me trust the process even in defeat
    And Trust in community governance is maintained through honest engagement

  Scenario: Appeal of community surveillance or monitoring practices
    Given I believe Community Elohim monitors community members too intrusively
    And I am concerned about surveillance overreach
    When I appeal the monitoring practices
    Then Constitutional Council evaluates if surveillance exceeds constitutional minimums
    And They examine if monitoring serves legitimate care purposes
    And They consider if less invasive methods could achieve same goals
    And They assess if community members have visibility into what's monitored
    And They evaluate if appeal and recourse mechanisms are working properly
    And The appeal protects community from surveillance creep
    And Privacy boundaries are actively defended not passively eroded

  Scenario: Appealing community conflict mediation outcome
    Given Community Elohim mediated a conflict between me and neighbors
    And I believe the proposed resolution is unjust
    When I appeal the mediation outcome
    Then Constitutional Council reviews if mediation process was fair
    And They evaluate if all parties had meaningful voice
    And They examine if constitutional principles guided the resolution
    And They consider if community harmony was balanced with individual justice
    And They assess if cultural conflict resolution norms were respected
    And The appeal can modify the resolution or offer alternative mediation
    And Community learns how to balance harmony with individual rights

  Scenario: Multiple appellants challenge same community decision
    Given several community members appeal the same Community Elohim decision
    And we all believe a community resource decision was unjust
    When Constitutional Council reviews the multiple related appeals
    Then they treat this as collective concern requiring community deliberation
    And They evaluate if the decision violated community consensus
    And They examine if community participation in the decision was adequate
    And They may convene community assembly to deliberate the issue
    And The appeals trigger democratic engagement not just individual recourse
    And Community governance evolves through collective voice

  Scenario: Appeal escalation path when community review insufficient
    Given Community Elohim review upheld the original decision
    And I remain convinced my constitutional rights were violated
    When I choose to escalate beyond community layer
    Then I can request peer agent review (three Family Elohim from other families)
    And If still unsatisfied, I can escalate to Regional Constitutional Council
    And Each layer brings fresh perspective and greater scrutiny
    And The escalation path is accessible without legal expertise
    And Timelines are maintained (peer review within 1 week, regional within 1 month)
    And Higher layers don't just rubber-stamp lower decisions
    And Genuine independent review happens at each escalation level

  Scenario: Community appeal informs local policy development
    Given my appeal revealed gaps in how Community Elohim handles certain situations
    And Constitutional Council made recommendations for improvement
    When Community Leader reviews appeal patterns and recommendations
    Then the leader brings findings to city council for policy response
    And Local ordinances may be updated to clarify boundaries
    And Community protocol calibration may be proposed
    And My individual appeal contributes to broader community governance
    And Democratic feedback loop connects appeals to policy improvement
    And Community becomes more responsive through listening to dissent
