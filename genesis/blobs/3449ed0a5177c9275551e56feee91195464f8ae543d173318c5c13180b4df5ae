Scenario: Neighborhood environmental stewardship
    Given Kenji is studying environmental science
    And neighborhoods are environmental governance units
    When Kenji participates in neighborhood environmental care
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize his stewardship work
    And it should value his participation in neighborhood cleanup
    And it should recognize his knowledge contributions about sustainability
    And environmental care should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should connect academic learning to neighborhood action
    And students should contribute environmental expertise to neighborhoods
