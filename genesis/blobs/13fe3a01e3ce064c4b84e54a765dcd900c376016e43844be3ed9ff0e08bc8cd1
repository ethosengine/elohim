Scenario: Interface designed for developing literacy and numeracy
    Given Emma is building reading and math skills
    And she can handle more complexity than younger children
    When Emma uses the Value Scanner interface
    Then text should be at appropriate reading level for ages 8-10
    And comparison tools should support decision-making
    And basic math support should help with calculating savings
    And visual aids should supplement text
    And the interface should feel helpful, not game-like
    And design should support skill development without frustration
