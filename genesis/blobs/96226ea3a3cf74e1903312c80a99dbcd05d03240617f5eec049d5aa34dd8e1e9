Scenario: Cultural representation challenges ableist narratives
    Given media representation of disability is often harmful
    And Alex works to improve disability representation
    When Alex engages in cultural advocacy (media, arts, education)
    Then representation work should be recognized as care labor
    And the community_elohim should value cultural transformation efforts
    And challenging ableist narratives benefits entire disabled community
    And Alex's cultural work should accumulate care tokens
    And the protocol should recognize that culture shapes material conditions
    And representation advocacy is sophisticated intellectual labor
    And Alex's contributions shift what community believes about disability
