Scenario: Recognizing different resource contributions to household
    Given Kenji contributes time and labor but limited money
    And one roommate might contribute more financially but less labor
    When the household_elohim tracks all forms of contribution
    Then it should value both care labor and financial contributions
    And it should recognize Kenji's cooking as economic contribution
    And it should show equivalence: "Kenji's cooking worth $X in meal prep time saved"
    And it should prevent assumption that money is only real contribution
    And the system should value diverse contribution types
    And household equity should include labor, time, and money
