Feature: Educational Layer Lifelong Learning and Wisdom Sharing for Elderly
  As an elderly person in the value scanner system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to continue learning and sharing knowledge throughout my life
  So that I experience ongoing growth and contribute accumulated wisdom

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elderly user "Helen" is registered in the system
    And Helen has 82 years of lived experience
    And Helen manages early-stage dementia but retains substantial knowledge
    And the educational governance context is active
    And learning and contribution continue throughout life

  Scenario: Senior learning programs adapted for cognitive accessibility
    Given Helen participates in senior learning programs
    And her cognitive and physical capabilities require accommodation
    When Helen engages with educational content
    Then programs should be paced for senior learners
    And materials should use large fonts and high contrast
    And voice content should be available alongside visual
    And no time pressure should be imposed
    And learning should be meaningful, not make-work
    And the protocol should ensure education remains accessible at all ages
    And Helen should experience genuine learning, not patronizing activities

  Scenario: Accumulated wisdom recognized as valuable knowledge
    Given Helen has 82 years of lived experience
    And this accumulated wisdom has educational value
    When Helen shares her knowledge with others
    Then her contributions should be recognized as teaching
    And care tokens should reflect her educational labor
    And wisdom sharing should be valued alongside formal education
    And the protocol should make visible that elders are teachers
    And Helen should experience herself as knowledge contributor
    And educational systems should recognize experiential learning
    And lifetime of experience should be treated as legitimate expertise

  Scenario: Intergenerational knowledge transfer through elder mentoring
    Given younger generations lack knowledge Helen possesses
    And intergenerational learning benefits all participants
    When Helen mentors grandchildren or community youth
    Then her teaching should be facilitated by educational systems
    And younger learners should be connected to elder mentors
    And Helen should be recognized as educator, not just "nice grandma"
    And care tokens should reflect her teaching work
    And the protocol should coordinate intergenerational learning
    And educational value should flow in both directions
    And youth should learn to value elder wisdom

  Scenario: Memory preservation as educational contribution
    Given Helen holds family and community history
    And dementia threatens loss of collective memory
    When Helen participates in memory preservation projects
    Then her storytelling should be captured for educational archives
    And oral history should be treated as legitimate historical knowledge
    And her participation should be recognized as educational contribution
    And the protocol should prioritize preservation while Helen can still share
    And cultural heritage should be maintained through elder participation
    And Helen's memory keeping should be valued as community education
    And historical knowledge should be preserved before it's lost

  Scenario: Technology literacy education adapted for elderly learners
    Given Helen needs technology skills for daily functioning
    And technology education often ignores elderly learners
    When Helen learns to use new technologies
    Then instruction should be adapted to her learning pace
    And age-appropriate pedagogy should be employed
    And no assumption of prior tech knowledge should be made
    And patient repetition should be available
    And learning should serve her actual needs, not abstract skills
    And the protocol should ensure elderly inclusion in digital literacy
    And Helen should be empowered, not left behind by technology

  Scenario: Teaching traditional skills and practices to younger generations
    Given Helen knows traditional household management, cooking, and crafts
    And younger generations often lack these practical skills
    When Helen teaches traditional knowledge
    Then her expertise should be recognized and valued
    And teaching opportunities should be coordinated
    And her knowledge should be preserved through transmission
    And care tokens should reflect her educational contributions
    And the protocol should facilitate skills transfer from elders
    And traditional knowledge should be valued in educational systems
    And Helen should experience being needed for what she knows

  Scenario: Learning that personhood and growth continue until death
    Given culture often treats elderly as finished developing
    And Helen continues to learn and grow at 82
    When Helen engages with educational opportunities
    Then the protocol should affirm that learning never ends
    And growth should be supported at all ages
    And Helen should experience ongoing development
    And new capabilities should be acknowledged and celebrated
    And education should reject notion that personhood ends with productivity decline
    And the protocol should model that humans grow throughout life
    And Helen should learn that she remains person until death

  Scenario: Cognitive support enables continued learning despite limitations
    Given Helen's dementia affects learning and memory
    And cognitive support can enable continued engagement
    When Helen participates in educational activities
    Then her personal_agent should provide cognitive scaffolding
    And material should be adapted to her cognitive capabilities
    And she should experience success, not frustration
    And limitations should be accommodated, not treated as disqualification
    And the protocol should enable learning despite cognitive changes
    And Helen should remain engaged with intellectual life
    And dementia should not end her identity as learner

  Scenario: Value literacy education through lived experience at advanced age
    Given Helen uses Value Scanner with assistance
    And she's learning care economy principles through practice
    When Helen makes care-based decisions
    Then she should be learning that her contributions still matter
    And value literacy should be accessible at all ages
    And care economy principles should be demonstrated through her experience
    And she should understand that care has value regardless of age
    And the protocol should teach through experience, not explanation
    And Helen should internalize that she has worth beyond productivity
    And care economy education should include all ages

  Scenario: Teaching about aging and mortality to younger generations
    Given Helen faces mortality consciously
    And younger generations need education about aging and death
    When Helen shares her experience of aging
    Then this should be recognized as valuable teaching
    And younger people should learn from her direct experience
    And education about mortality should come from those facing it
    And Helen should be recognized as expert on her own aging
    And the protocol should facilitate difficult but necessary conversations
    And death education should be normalized through elder participation
    And Helen's voice should teach community about aging with dignity

  Scenario: Ecological wisdom from lifetime of experience
    Given Helen has observed environmental changes over 82 years
    And her generation has knowledge of pre-industrial practices
    When Helen shares ecological knowledge
    Then her observations should inform environmental education
    And traditional sustainable practices should be preserved
    And her lifetime of data should be valued in climate education
    And care tokens should reflect her contribution to ecological stewardship
    And the protocol should recognize elders as environmental historians
    And ecological education should include elder perspectives
    And Helen's knowledge should contribute to community sustainability

  Scenario: Continued intellectual engagement prevents cognitive decline
    Given cognitive engagement supports brain health in aging
    And intellectual isolation accelerates decline
    When Helen participates in learning and teaching
    Then educational engagement should be recognized as health intervention
    And community should support elder intellectual life
    And learning opportunities should be accessible and meaningful
    And the protocol should demonstrate that education serves health in aging
    And Helen should remain intellectually engaged
    And cognitive health should be supported through educational participation
    And investment in elder learning should be justified by health outcomes
