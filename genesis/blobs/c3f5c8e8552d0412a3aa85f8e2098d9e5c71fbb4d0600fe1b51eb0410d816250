    And instruction is naturally accessible (IDD peer teaching IDD peer)
    And Jordan learns strategies that actually work in practice
    And Jordan accumulates care tokens for participating in peer learning community
    And the peer educator accumulates tokens for teaching contribution
    And Jordan experiences IDD community as source of knowledge and support
