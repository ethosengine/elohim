Scenario: Traditional sustainable practices preserved through elder teaching
    Given Helen learned pre-consumer household management
    And she knows seasonal food preservation, waste reduction, and resource conservation
    When Helen teaches traditional sustainable practices
    Then her knowledge should be recognized as environmental education
    And younger generations should learn low-impact living from her experience
    And traditional practices should inform modern sustainability efforts
    And Helen should be valued as expert in sustainable living
    And the protocol should facilitate skills transfer from pre-disposable era
    And ecological wisdom should be preserved through intergenerational teaching
    And Helen's knowledge should contribute to reduced environmental impact
