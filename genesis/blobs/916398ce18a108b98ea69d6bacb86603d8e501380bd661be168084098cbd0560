Scenario: Learning contributes to collective knowledge without exploitation
    Given Emma's learning patterns generate educational data
    And this data could improve pedagogy for other children
    When Emma's anonymized learning data is collected
    Then it must only be used to improve educational outcomes
    And Emma's privacy must be absolutely protected
    And no commercial exploitation should occur
    And data should serve collective learning, not surveillance capitalism
    And educational data must never be monetized
    And community benefit must not compromise individual privacy
