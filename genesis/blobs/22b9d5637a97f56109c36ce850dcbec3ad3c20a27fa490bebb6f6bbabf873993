Scenario: Teen's care contributions prevent exploitation within family
    Given Jasmine contributes substantial household labor
    And there is risk of teen labor being exploited even within families
    When Jasmine's care contributions exceed healthy boundaries
    Then the family_elohim should flag potential exploitation
    And surface if Jasmine's responsibilities are preventing her development
    And recognize if she's providing excessive childcare or household labor
    And prompt family discussion about fair distribution of care work
    And protect Jasmine from being trapped in unpaid household labor
    And ensure her contributions are recognized and not taken for granted
