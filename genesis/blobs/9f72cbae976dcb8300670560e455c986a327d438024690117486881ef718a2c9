Scenario: Personal agent coordinates overwhelming complexity across four generations
    Given Robert manages care responsibilities across four generations
    And he tracks his parents' medical appointments and medications
    And he provides financial support and guidance to his adult children
    And he maintains his own household with his spouse
    And he occasionally provides care for his grandchild
    When Robert uses his personal_agent for coordination
    Then the agent should maintain awareness of all contexts simultaneously
    And surface conflicts: "Your father's cardiology appointment conflicts with your work presentation"
    And help him prioritize: "Jordan's apartment deposit is due before your mother's prescription refill"
    And reduce cognitive load by holding details he can't track alone
    And provide sophisticated decision support across multiple time horizons
    And function as genuine coordination partner for managing extreme complexity
