Scenario: Preventing roommate conflict through proactive visibility
    Given household labor imbalances breed resentment
    And students often avoid difficult conversations
    When the household_elohim detects emerging conflict patterns
    Then it should surface issues before they become conflicts
    And it should show data: "Jordan hasn't contributed household labor in 3 weeks"
    And it should facilitate constructive conversation with neutral framing
    And it should help roommates renegotiate responsibilities
    And preventive intervention should maintain household harmony
    And the system should support healthy household dynamics
