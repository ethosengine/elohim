Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing facilitated by retired residents' coordination
    Given Frank has time to coordinate neighborhood resource sharing
    And tool libraries, skill exchanges, and mutual aid require coordination
    When the neighborhood_elohim supports resource sharing
    Then it should enable Frank to help coordinate shared resources
    And facilitate tool borrowing, skill trades, and favor exchanges
    And recognize coordination labor as valuable care contribution
    And reduce neighborhood consumption through effective sharing
    And Frank's coordination work should build neighborhood resilience
    And his time availability should serve collective resource efficiency
