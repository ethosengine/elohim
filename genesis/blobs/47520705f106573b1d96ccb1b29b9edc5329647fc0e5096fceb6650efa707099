Scenario: Activist demands community benefits agreement for environmental justice
    Given a development will impact the activist's environmental justice community
    And community has disproportionate environmental burden
    When the Observer documents cumulative environmental harms
    Then the activist presents evidence of existing pollution exposure
    And demands green infrastructure investment as mitigation
    And proposes specific community benefits (parks, tree canopy, remediation)
    And coalition negotiates from position of documented harm
    And development must address environmental justice not just profit
