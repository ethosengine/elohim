Scenario: Teen participates in municipal sustainability initiatives
    Given the municipality has climate action and sustainability goals
    And Jasmine makes consumption choices reflecting environmental values
    When she participates in municipal environmental programs
    Then her ecological care work should be tracked and valued
    And municipal_elohim should aggregate youth environmental contributions
    And recognize that youth climate activism is care work for future generations
    And connect individual choices to municipal sustainability metrics
    And demonstrate that youth environmental leadership advances city goals
    And support her generation's investment in climate action
