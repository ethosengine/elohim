Scenario: Community recognition of family caregiving as professional-grade work
    Given James provides skilled care equivalent to professional nursing
    And his work is invisible because he cares for family
    When the community_elohim evaluates caregiving contributions
    Then James's care should be valued at professional rates
    And community should recognize family caregiving as essential infrastructure
    And care token accumulation should reflect professional-grade value
    And invisibility of family care should be systematically addressed
    And community care economy should make family caregiving visible
