Scenario: Workplace childcare assistance or subsidies
    Given Maria pays substantial portion of income for childcare
    And childcare costs are major burden on single-parent households
    When Maria balances childcare needs with employment
    Then workplace should provide childcare assistance or subsidies
    And employer-supported childcare should reduce financial burden
    And assistance should recognize that single parents bear full childcare costs alone
    And workplace support should enable employment sustainability
    And Maria should receive help with care costs that make work possible
