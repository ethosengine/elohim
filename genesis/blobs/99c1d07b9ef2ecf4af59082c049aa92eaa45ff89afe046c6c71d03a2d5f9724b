Scenario: Right to be imperfect parent without shame
    Given Sarah cannot possibly meet all demands perfectly
    And parenting culture enforces impossible standards
    When Sarah makes suboptimal choices under constraint
    Then the personal_agent should never shame or guilt
    And it should validate "You're doing your best with available resources"
    And it should recognize that good-enough parenting is actually good
    And perfectionism should be rejected as harmful
    And Sarah should be supported in sustainable imperfection
    And the system should counteract toxic parenting culture
