Scenario: Municipal services coordinate for multigenerational family support
    Given Robert's family needs span eldercare, young adult support, and household services
    And municipal services are often siloed by department
    And coordinated service delivery would better serve families
    When municipal_elohim coordinates service delivery
    Then it should help Robert navigate municipal services across departments
    And connect aging services, youth programs, housing assistance, and employment support
    And surface relevant municipal resources across his family's needs
    And demonstrate how integrated service delivery serves families
    And advocate for municipal coordination across service silos
    And build municipal systems that recognize multigenerational family reality
    And reduce burden of navigating fragmented municipal services
