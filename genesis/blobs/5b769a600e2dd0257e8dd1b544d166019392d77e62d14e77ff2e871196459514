Scenario: Teacher builds solidarity across educator roles
    Given teachers, paraprofessionals, and support staff share labor interests
    But often lack coordination and mutual understanding
    When the Observer facilitates cross-role working conditions analysis
    Then educators see shared challenges (understaffing, disrespect, inadequate pay)
    And identify how working conditions affect student support
    And build coalition across educator roles for contract negotiations
    And solidarity emerges from shared evidence and common interests
    And labor advocacy becomes comprehensive not siloed
