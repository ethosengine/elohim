Scenario: Displaced community coordinates with climate adaptation network
    Given multiple coastal communities face similar climate displacement
    When they form a climate displacement affinity network
    And they share strategies for community preservation
    Then communities learn from each other's experiences
    And successful resettlement patterns are documented and shared
    And coordinated advocacy for climate displacement support emerges
    And the network coordinates with climate justice activists
    And systemic support for climate migrants is organized
