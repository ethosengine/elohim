Scenario: Frugality and resource conservation aligned with ecological sustainability
    Given Frank lives on fixed income requiring careful resource management
    And resource conservation serves both budget and ecological goals
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks resource use
    Then it should recognize Frank's frugality as ecological practice
    And resource optimization should be framed as stewardship, not just scarcity
    And his careful consumption should be valued as ecological wisdom
    And practices like reducing waste and buying quality should be celebrated
    And economic constraint should be understood as ecological virtue
    And Frank's lifestyle should model sustainable consumption
