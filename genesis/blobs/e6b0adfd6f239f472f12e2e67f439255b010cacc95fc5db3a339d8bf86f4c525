Feature: Global-Level Governance Research for Researcher
  As a researcher in the governance system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want to study protocol adoption and governance across all humanity
  So that I can understand universal patterns and cultural variations in democratic AI

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the researcher user is registered in the system
    And the global governance context is active
    And Dr. James Chen participates in global research networks

  Scenario: Global research network coordinating cross-cultural studies
    Given protocol has been adopted in diverse nations worldwide
    And I am part of international research consortium
    When we coordinate parallel studies across continents
    Then we examine: how cultural context shapes constitutional interpretation
    And we compare: collectivist vs individualist societies' implementations
    And we analyze: different political systems' integration patterns
    And we identify: universal patterns vs cultural adaptations
    And we share: methodologies and data (with appropriate protection)
    And we test: whether democratic AI governance is Western innovation or universal possibility
    And Our global collaboration reveals: humanity's shared and diverse governance approaches

  Scenario: Analyzing Global Constitutional Convention deliberations
    Given 10,000 randomly-selected global citizens convene every 7 years
    And this is unprecedented experiment in planetary democracy
    When I study the Global Constitutional Convention process
    Then I examine: how citizens from radically different contexts deliberate together
    And I analyze: what enables agreement despite profound disagreement
    And I assess: quality of translation and cross-cultural understanding
    And I explore: how amendments emerge from global collective wisdom
    And I identify: power dynamics (Global North vs South, wealthy vs poor)
    And I investigate: whether global sortition can produce legitimate law
    And My research reveals: possibilities and limits of planetary democratic governance

  Scenario: Comparative analysis of protocol adoption across 100+ nations
    Given protocol has different adoption rates and outcomes globally
    And I want to understand what predicts success across contexts
    When I analyze adoption patterns and outcomes worldwide
    Then I examine: economic factors (wealth, inequality, development stage)
    And I assess: political factors (democracy, authoritarianism, stability)
    And I explore: cultural factors (individualism, trust, religious tradition)
    And I identify: historical factors (colonialism, technology access, institutional quality)
    And I analyze: which factors are necessary, sufficient, or contingent
    And My comparative research identifies: pathways to democratic AI governance
    And Findings inform: international development and adoption strategies

  Scenario: Studying global inequality in protocol access and benefits
    Given I hypothesize protocol might exacerbate global inequality
    And wealthy nations can afford infrastructure poor nations cannot
    When I analyze distributional effects at global scale
    Then I examine: adoption rates by national income and infrastructure
    And I assess: whether benefits flow primarily to Global North
    And I measure: whether protocol reduces or increases global inequality
    And I explore: mechanisms of digital colonialism or democratic leveling
    And I identify: barriers preventing equitable global adoption
    And I advocate: for international funding and technology transfer
    And My research serves: global justice by revealing inequities

  Scenario: Historical and comparative analysis contextualizing protocol
    Given I want to understand what's genuinely novel vs reinventing wheels
    And I study governance history and comparative political theory
    When I contextualize Elohim Protocol in historical perspective
    Then I compare: to Athenian democracy's sortition practices
    And I examine: medieval communes' participatory governance
    And I analyze: modern citizens' assemblies and deliberative innovations
    And I explore: attempts to govern non-human powerful systems (corporations, markets)
    And I identify: what ancient wisdom applies and what's unprecedented
    And I assess: whether humanity has governed comparable complexity before
    And My historical analysis reveals: patterns and lessons across millennia

  Scenario: Global data infrastructure with privacy and sovereignty protection
    Given I need access to data across nations for research
    And I must respect privacy, sovereignty, and data justice
    When global research infrastructure is designed
    Then I work with: federated data systems respecting national sovereignty
    And I use: differential privacy protecting individual anonymity
    And I ensure: community data ownership and benefit sharing
    And I implement: ethical review and consent protocols
    And I advocate: for open access to research findings
    And I practice: data justice not data colonialism
    And My methodology demonstrates: how to study globally while respecting locally

  Scenario: Research on protocol as global existential risk mitigation
    Given superintelligent AI poses existential risk to humanity
    And I study whether democratic governance can address this risk
    When I analyze protocol as existential risk mitigation strategy
    Then I examine: whether constitutional accountability reduces AI risk
    And I assess: whether sortition prevents elite capture of superintelligence
    And I explore: whether transparency enables democratic oversight at scale
    And I analyze: whether recourse mechanisms provide adaptation to unknown risks
    And I investigate: whether protocol's distributed architecture increases resilience
    And I conclude: honestly about uncertainties and limitations
    And My research informs: humanity's response to its most important challenge

  Scenario: Global research ethics and decolonizing methodology
    Given historical research often extracted from Global South for Global North benefit
    And I want to practice ethical global research
    When I design my research methodology and partnerships
    Then I ensure: local researchers lead studies in their contexts
    And I practice: equitable benefit sharing and co-authorship
    And I support: capacity building in Global South institutions
    And I challenge: Western-centric theories and methods
    And I listen: to diverse epistemologies and knowledge systems
    And I acknowledge: positionality and power in research relationships
    And My practice embodies: research ethics aligned with protocol's dignity principles

  Scenario: Contributing to global public discourse on AI governance
    Given public understanding shapes political will for democratic AI
    And I have findings that matter for global deliberation
    When I engage in global public education and discourse
    Then I write: accessible articles for general audiences
    And I give: public lectures explaining research findings
    And I participate: in media discussions with honesty about uncertainties
    And I contribute: to democratic deliberation about governance alternatives
    And I explain: what's at stake, what options exist, what evidence shows
    And I avoid: false certainty or ideological advocacy
    And My public engagement serves: informed democratic choice about AI governance

  Scenario: Longitudinal global study tracking generational transformation
    Given I study whether protocol transforms civic culture across generations
    And Tommy's generation is growing up with democratic AI governance
    When I track generational cohorts over 20-30 years
    Then I examine: civic capacities (constitutional literacy, deliberation skills)
    And I assess: political participation and democratic engagement
    And I measure: relationship to AI and technology
    And I explore: whether growing up with protocol creates different citizenship
    And I analyze: intergenerational transmission of democratic culture
    And I investigate: whether protocol's effects compound across generations
    And My research captures: civilizational transformation over human timescales

  Scenario: Global meta-analysis synthesizing all protocol research
    Given hundreds of researchers have studied protocol worldwide
    And I want to synthesize cumulative knowledge
    When I conduct systematic review and meta-analysis
    Then I identify: all rigorous studies meeting quality criteria
    And I synthesize: findings across diverse contexts and methods
    And I assess: overall evidence about effectiveness and limitations
    And I examine: publication bias and selective reporting
    And I identify: gaps in knowledge requiring further research
    And I provide: comprehensive evidence base for global policy
    And My meta-analysis serves: evidence-based democratic deliberation at planetary scale

  Scenario: Research on cultural values and constitutional universality
    Given protocol claims universal minimums while allowing cultural diversity
    And I question whether "universal" reflects Western bias
    When I study constitutional interpretation across radically different cultures
    Then I examine: how different traditions understand dignity, care, autonomy
    And I analyze: whether constitutional principles translate across worldviews
    And I explore: legitimate cultural variation vs cultural relativism about harm
    And I identify: truly universal minimums vs culturally specific instantiations
    And I assess: whether protocol enables pluralism or imposes uniformity
    And My research informs: global constitutional evolution that honors diversity
    And Findings shape: how humanity governs together while respecting difference

  Scenario: Presenting research at Global Constitutional Convention
    Given convention delegates need evidence to inform constitutional decisions
    And I am invited to present research on sortition effectiveness
    When I address 10,000 randomly-selected citizens from around the world
    Then I summarize: what research shows about democratic AI governance
    And I present: honestly about successes, failures, and uncertainties
    And I explain: the superintelligence governance legitimacy question
    And I acknowledge: the limits of my knowledge and research
    And I clarify: that delegates must make values choices research cannot resolve
    And I serve: democracy by informing not replacing citizen judgment
    And My scholarship demonstrates: how expertise serves rather than dominates democracy
