Scenario: Documenting medical discrimination and ableism
    Given medical systems frequently discriminate against disabled people
    And ableism in healthcare can be life-threatening
    When Alex experiences medical discrimination
    Then the personal_agent should help Alex document discriminatory incidents
    And it should identify patterns of discriminatory treatment
    And it should connect Alex to legal resources and advocacy organizations
    And documentation should support complaints to licensing boards
    And the protocol should take medical discrimination seriously
    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves from medical harm
    And systemic patterns should be made visible for accountability
