Scenario: Teacher documents inadequate support staff
    Given the school lacks sufficient counselors and specialists
    And students with learning needs aren't getting services
    When teachers collectively document support staff gaps through Observer
    Then aggregated data shows 300 students per counselor vs 250 recommended
    And student impact patterns become visible
    And teachers coordinate advocacy with parents for resources
    And principal takes evidence to district for staffing increase
    And professional knowledge drives resource allocation
