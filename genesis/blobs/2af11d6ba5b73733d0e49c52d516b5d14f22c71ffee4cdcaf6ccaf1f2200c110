Scenario: Politician navigates union relations with constituent worker focus
    Given the politician receives support from labor unions
    And business groups warn against union influence
    When the Observer provides balanced labor relations analysis
    Then they see how unionization affects worker wages and conditions
    And understand union priorities versus broader worker constituent needs
    And identify where union advocacy aligns with constituent interests
    And review economic impacts of unionization across industries
    And navigate union relations focused on worker constituent wellbeing
