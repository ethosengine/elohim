Scenario: Global precedent for existential constitutional questions
    Given an appeal raises question about superintelligence governance
    And the question is whether humans can oversee reasoning they can't understand
    When the case reaches global Constitutional Council
    Then the council convenes emergency global deliberation
    And experts like Amara explain technical constraints
    And appellants explain dignity concerns about being governed by incomprehensible systems
    And the council establishes global precedent on explainability requirements
    And the precedent applies to all jurisdictions implementing protocol
    And human dignity is preserved even as AI capabilities grow
