Scenario: Balancing learning work with survival work
    Given Kenji must work 15 hours/week to afford basic expenses
    And work hours compete with study time
    When the educational_elohim helps Kenji balance competing demands
    Then it should recognize the impossible tension between learning and survival
    And it should help him optimize limited time across demands
    And it should validate that he cannot do everything perfectly
    And it should advocate for better institutional support for working students
    And the system should recognize structural unfairness in student economics
    And Kenji should not be blamed for constraints created by inadequate support
