Scenario: Work schedule flexibility for academic obligations
    Given Kenji must attend classes and cannot work during certain hours
    And exam periods require reduced work availability
    When Kenji's workplace_elohim advocates for schedule flexibility
    Then it should help Kenji communicate academic constraints to employer
    And it should support negotiating exam week time off
    And it should recognize that flexible scheduling is care economy practice
    And employers should accommodate student educational needs
    And the system should help Kenji assert right to education
    And work should support student development, not undermine it
