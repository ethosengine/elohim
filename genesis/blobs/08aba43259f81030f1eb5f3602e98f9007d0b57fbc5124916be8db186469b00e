Scenario: Operator confronts honest accounting of value creation
    Given James believed he "built" the business through risk and management
    And honest accounting reveals distributed value creation
    When conversion process makes contributions visible through REA documentation
    Then James sees workers created operational value through daily labor (Maria's training, Emma's optimization)
    And corporate created systems value but extracted far more than systems were worth
    And his coordination and risk-bearing were real but not sole value creation
    And humbling recognition enables fair distribution replacing mythologized ownership
    And workplace_elohim provides transparent value creation documentation
