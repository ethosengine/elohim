Scenario: Intergenerational ecological responsibility and future generations
    Given Sarah is raising children who will face climate consequences
    And current generation's choices affect future generations
    When the ecological_elohim assesses intergenerational care
    Then it should recognize Sarah's work preparing children for climate future
    And it should value her teaching of environmental responsibility
    And raising environmentally conscious children should be recognized as service to future
    And the system should honor intergenerational ecological care
    And Sarah's parenting should be valued as investment in planetary future
    And care for future generations should be fundamental care economy principle
