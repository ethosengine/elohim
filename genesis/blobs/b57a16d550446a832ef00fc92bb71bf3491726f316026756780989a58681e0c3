Scenario: Training city staff to work alongside protocol agents
    Given city employees need to understand protocol to do their jobs
    And they may feel threatened by AI systems
    When I coordinate staff training and cultural adaptation
    Then we explain: how protocol augments not replaces their work
    And we provide: training on working with agent information
    And we clarify: that professional judgment remains valued
    And we ensure: staff see agents as tools not replacements
    And we maintain: good jobs with dignity for city workers
    And we demonstrate: that democratic AI can strengthen not undermine labor
    And implementation respects: people doing the work
