Scenario: Community care economy smooths young adult economic vulnerability
    Given Aisha has adult responsibility without established resources
    And this is a particularly vulnerable life phase
    When Aisha participates in community care economy
    Then the community_elohim should provide safety net
    And it should connect her to resources during crisis
    And it should enable access to community support
    And the system should reduce young adult economic precarity
    And community care should buffer individual vulnerability
    And mutual aid should support those in transition
