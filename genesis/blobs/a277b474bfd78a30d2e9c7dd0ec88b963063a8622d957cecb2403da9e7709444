Scenario: Manager mediates conflict without imposing judgment
    Given two workers have disagreement about task allocation
    And corporate model had Marcus impose solution or discipline both
    When workers bring conflict to Marcus for mediation
    Then Marcus facilitates structured conversation between parties

    And Marcus proposes potential compromise solutions
    And workers, not Marcus, decide on resolution
    And workplace_elohim documents process ensuring fairness
    And conflict resolves through dialogue, not managerial authority
