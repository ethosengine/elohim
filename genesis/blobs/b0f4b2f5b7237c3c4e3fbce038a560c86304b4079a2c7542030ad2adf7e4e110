Scenario: Navigating community relationships with people at different vulnerability levels
    Given community includes people in various circumstances (crisis, stability, privilege)
    And relationships cross different resource and vulnerability levels
    When I interact with community members from different positions
    Then the community_elohim facilitates cross-difference relationships
    And validates that I am peer regardless of current circumstances
    And helps me navigate power dynamics in community relationships
    And prevents exploitation while enabling genuine connection
    And recognizes that care economy includes people in various situations
    And my personal_agent supports me in authentic relationships across difference
    And tracks care economy participation beyond simplistic "giver/receiver" binary
    And celebrates diverse community including vulnerable and privileged members
