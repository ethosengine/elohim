Scenario: Teen recognized as full community participant, not future member
    Given Jasmine has substantial care contributions across multiple contexts
    And she volunteers 4 hours per week at community center
    When the community_elohim processes her participation
    Then she should be recognized as a current contributor, not a youth in training
    And her care work should be valued at the same care economy rate as adults
    And community resources should be accessible based on her demonstrated contribution
    And she should have standing in community care economy discussions
    And the system should reflect that she is already a productive member of society
    And her generation's contributions should be made visible at community scale
