Scenario: Personal agent provides collegial support for complex adult work
    Given Marcus is performing work that adults get paid to do
    And he needs sophisticated planning and analysis tools
    When Marcus's personal_agent interacts with him
    Then the relationship should be almost collegial
    And the agent should provide information, analysis, and planning support
    And the agent should say "You've kept nutrition above 90% for three weeks—excellent stewardship"
    And emotional encouragement should acknowledge real difficulty of his work
    And the agent should serve as genuine tool for real work
    And the tone should respect his capability while supporting his needs
