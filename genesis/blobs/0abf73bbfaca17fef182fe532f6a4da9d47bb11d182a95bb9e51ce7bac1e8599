Feature: Workplace Care Economy and Worker Advocacy
  As a worker in an employment relationship
  I need tools for understanding my rights and advocating for care-aligned workplace conditions
  So that my workplace respects my dignity and enables my capacity for care and flourishing

  Background:
    Given I am employed at a restaurant with challenging conditions
    And my workplace_elohim monitors workplace conditions and rights
    And the protocol recognizes workers' care needs and labor rights
    And I have access to workplace advocacy tools

  Scenario: Recognizing workplace exploitation patterns
    Given my employer demands maximum flexibility with minimal compensation
    And I experience unpredictable scheduling, low wages, and poor conditions
    When the workplace_elohim analyzes my employment situation
    Then it should identify exploitation patterns
    And help me recognize when conditions violate standards or norms
    And provide information about my legal rights and protections
    And empower me to name what I am experiencing

  Scenario: Documenting workplace violations
    Given my workplace may violate labor laws or regulations
    Including wage theft, unsafe conditions, or scheduling violations
    When I experience potential violations
    Then the workplace_elohim should help me document incidents
    And track patterns of violations over time
    And provide guidance on reporting mechanisms
    And preserve evidence for potential enforcement or advocacy

  Scenario: Advocating for predictable scheduling
    Given unpredictable scheduling destroys my capacity for care work
    And I cannot manage household, health, or family needs without schedule stability
    When I want to advocate for predictable scheduling
    Then the protocol should help me build the case for schedule predictability
    And provide evidence of how current scheduling harms my well-being
    And support me in requesting schedule improvements
    And connect me with co-workers who share this need

  Scenario: Understanding and claiming wage rights
    Given I am entitled to minimum wage, overtime pay, and tip protections
    And wage theft is common in food service industry
    When I track my hours and compensation
    Then the workplace_elohim should help me verify I am paid correctly
    And identify potential wage violations
    And provide guidance on claiming unpaid wages
    And support me in pursuing wage justice

  Scenario: Organizing with co-workers for collective advocacy
    Given individual workers have limited power
    And collective action is more effective for workplace change
    When I want to organize with co-workers for better conditions
    Then the protocol should help me connect with co-workers safely
    And facilitate coordination for collective advocacy
    And provide information about organizing rights and strategies
    And support building worker solidarity and collective power

  Scenario: Advocating for care-economy-aligned workplace policies
    Given my workplace treats me as labor unit without care needs
    When I want to advocate for care-supportive policies
    Then the protocol should help me propose specific policies
    Such as paid sick leave, predictable scheduling, living wages, meal provisions
    And provide evidence for why these policies support workers' flourishing
    And help me communicate needs to management
    And support pushing for workplace transformation

  Scenario: Recognizing my labor as care contribution
    Given I prepare food that nourishes people and serves community
    When I view my work through care economy lens
    Then the protocol should help me understand my work as care labor
    And accumulate care tokens reflecting my contribution to community well-being
    And reframe my relationship to work from pure exploitation to meaningful service
    And build consciousness that my labor deserves dignity and fair compensation

  Scenario: Accessing workplace accommodations for care needs
    Given I may need accommodations for health, family, or care responsibilities
    When I need to request workplace accommodations
    Then the workplace_elohim should help me understand my rights
    And support me in making formal accommodation requests
    And provide guidance on documentation and process
    And advocate for my right to work conditions that don't destroy my capacity for care

  Scenario: Identifying unsafe or harmful workplace conditions
    Given restaurant work involves physical demands and potential hazards
    When I experience unsafe conditions or health risks
    Then the workplace_elohim should help me identify hazards
    And provide information about workplace safety rights
    And support me in reporting unsafe conditions
    And advocate for conditions that protect workers' health

  Scenario: Navigating workplace power dynamics
    Given employers have significant power over workers
    And I may fear retaliation for advocating for my needs
    When I need to navigate workplace advocacy carefully
    Then the protocol should help me understand my protections
    And provide strategies for advocacy that minimize retaliation risk
    And connect me with legal resources if needed
    And support me in exercising my rights despite power imbalance

  Scenario: Demanding workplace democracy and worker voice
    Given decisions affecting my life are made without my input
    When I want to advocate for worker participation in decisions
    Then the protocol should support advocacy for workplace democracy
    And help me articulate the case for worker voice in governance
    And provide information about worker ownership and cooperative models
    And build consciousness that workers deserve decision-making power

  Scenario: Making visible that current conditions prevent care work
    Given my 50+ hour work weeks leave no time or energy for self-care or family care
    When I want to demonstrate that work conditions are unsustainable
    Then the protocol should help me document how work prevents care
    And make visible the contradiction between work demands and human needs
    And provide evidence for advocacy around reduced hours and better conditions
    And build case that "labor shortage" is really "dignity and compensation shortage"
