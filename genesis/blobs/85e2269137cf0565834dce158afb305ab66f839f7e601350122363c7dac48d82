Scenario: Journalist monitors environmental permits across multiple agencies
    Given the journalist covers regional environmental issues
    And must track city, county, state, and federal environmental agencies
    When the Observer monitors all environmental agencies simultaneously
    Then the journalist reviews all permit applications and approvals
    And receives alerts for controversial permits and violations
    And tracks cumulative environmental impacts across jurisdictions
    And comprehensive environmental surveillance becomes sustainable
    And polluters cannot hide in bureaucratic complexity
