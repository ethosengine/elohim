Scenario: Municipal land use and zoning protect community businesses from displacement
    Given commercial real estate speculation threatens community institutions
    And Rosa's Auto could face displacement through rising rents or property sale
    When democratic ownership is recognized as community benefit
    Then zoning policies prioritize long-term community business tenancy
    And city explores community land trusts for commercial space
    And democratic businesses receive preference in publicly-owned commercial properties
    And land use policy protects against speculation displacing community institutions
    And municipality_elohim advocates for commercial anti-displacement policies
