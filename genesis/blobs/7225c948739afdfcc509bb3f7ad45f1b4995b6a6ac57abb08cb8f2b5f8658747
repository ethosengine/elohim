Scenario: Legislator evaluates major bill with comprehensive impact analysis
    Given education reform legislation has 200 pages
    And supporters present optimistic outcomes while opponents predict disaster
    When the Observer provides evidence-based impact analysis
    Then they see how similar legislation performed in other states
    And understand fiscal impacts on districts with different demographics
    And identify which students benefit versus harmed by changes
    And review educator and parent perspectives from constituent communities
    And make informed vote beyond partisan talking points
