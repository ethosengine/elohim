Feature: Labor and Worker Organizing for Community Organizer
  As a community organizer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational functional layer
  I want to build worker power and worker-community coalitions for economic justice
  So that civic policy prioritizes living wages, workplace protections, and worker voice

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the community_organizer user is registered in the system
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active

  Scenario: Organizer identifies living wage campaign opportunity
    Given city council will consider minimum wage ordinance
    And workers struggle with poverty wages despite full-time work
    When the Observer surfaces the organizing opportunity
    Then the organizer sees local wage patterns and living wage gap
    And identifies which workers and communities are most affected
    And gets analysis showing public subsidies to low-wage employers
    And receives alert early enough to organize worker-community coalition
    And municipal wage policy becomes organizing opportunity

  Scenario: Organizer builds worker-community coalition for living wage
    Given workers can't afford housing in city where they work
    And residents care about economic stability of their communities
    When the organizer uses Observer to build coalition
    Then they connect low-wage workers with community advocates
    And show how poverty wages harm both workers and neighborhoods
    And coordinate testimony combining worker lived experience and community impact
    And facilitate coalition across four languages and multiple industries
    And labor organizing becomes community economic justice campaign

  Scenario: Organizer creates accessible materials on community benefits agreement
    Given developer seeks public subsidy for major project
    And promises to "create jobs" but history shows otherwise
    When the organizer requests education materials from Observer
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of community benefits agreements
    And see developer's labor track record from past projects
    And get template for CBA with binding labor standards
    And access wage and hiring data to counter developer claims
    And complex economic development becomes community organizing opportunity

  Scenario: Organizer develops worker leaders for city council testimony
    Given restaurant workers face wage theft and unsafe conditions
    And most have never engaged in civic advocacy
    When the organizer supports leadership development via Observer
    Then workers receive accessible data on wage theft patterns
    And get testimony framework they can personalize with their stories
    And see labor protection policies from other cities
    And practice addressing council member questions
    And workers become powerful advocates for their own interests

  Scenario: Organizer tracks accountability for paid sick leave implementation
    Given city passed paid sick leave ordinance
    And the organizer's worker-community coalition won the policy
    When the Observer tracks implementation and enforcement
    Then the organizer monitors employer compliance rates
    And sees enforcement actions and penalties for violations
    And identifies industries with systematic non-compliance
    And documents workers actually receiving sick leave
    And policy victory leads to implementation accountability ensuring real impact
