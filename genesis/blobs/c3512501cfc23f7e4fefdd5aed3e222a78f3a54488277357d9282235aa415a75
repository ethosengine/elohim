Scenario: Public transportation access supports senior independence
    Given Margaret can no longer afford car ownership
    And she needs transportation for medical appointments, shopping, and social life
    When the municipality_elohim provides transportation information
    Then accessible public transit should be available
    And senior fare programs should be communicated clearly
    And transportation should enable Margaret's continued independence
    And mobility should be supported as key to aging in community
    And municipal transit should be optimized for senior access
    And affordable transportation should preserve autonomy
