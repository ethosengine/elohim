Scenario: Business space becomes community gathering place beyond commercial function
    Given auto repair shop could serve community beyond car service
    And neighborhood lacks gathering spaces for organizing and connection
    When democratic governance considers community space usage
    Then workers offer shop space for community meetings after business hours
    And neighborhood organizing groups can use facilities for free
    And youth apprenticeship programs connect young people to skilled trades
    And community bulletin board shares neighborhood information and mutual aid
    And business becomes community hub, not just commercial enterprise
