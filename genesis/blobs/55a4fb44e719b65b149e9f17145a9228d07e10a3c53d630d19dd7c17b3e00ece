Scenario: Managing financial oversight with dignity
    Given Jordan's parents have financial guardianship
    And Jordan is learning money management skills
    When Jordan makes purchases with their allowance
    Then the personal_agent helps Jordan track spending
    And parents can monitor for safety without controlling every choice
    And Jordan has autonomy within appropriate boundaries
    And the family_elohim balances oversight with independence
    And Jordan's financial learning is supported, not prevented
    And Jordan experiences growing financial autonomy
