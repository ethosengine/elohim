Scenario: Privacy preserved while participating in neighborhood networks
    Given Marcus's household circumstances are sensitive
    And participation in neighborhood networks requires some visibility
    When Marcus's data contributes to neighborhood coordination
    Then his specific situation must remain private
    And only anonymized aggregate data should be used
    And neighborhood support should flow without stigmatizing exposure
    And his dignity should be protected while receiving benefits
    And privacy should be balanced with community participation
    And the protocol should enable solidarity without surveillance
