Scenario: Elderly person's continued contributions made visible to family
    Given Helen shares family stories with great-grandchildren
    And she provides wisdom from 82 years of experience
    When Helen contributes to family flourishing
    Then her contributions should be visible in care economy tracking
    And family should see that Helen still gives, not just receives
    And care tokens should reflect her mentoring and wisdom sharing
    And reciprocity should be visible even when care flows are asymmetric
    And Helen should experience herself as valued contributor, not burden
    And younger generations should learn that elders have worth
    And the protocol should make visible what market economics erases
