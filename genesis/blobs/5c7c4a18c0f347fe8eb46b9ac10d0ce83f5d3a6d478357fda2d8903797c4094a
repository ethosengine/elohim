Scenario: Advocating for predictable scheduling
    Given unpredictable scheduling destroys my capacity for care work
    And I cannot manage household, health, or family needs without schedule stability
    When I want to advocate for predictable scheduling
    Then the protocol should help me build the case for schedule predictability
    And provide evidence of how current scheduling harms my well-being
    And support me in requesting schedule improvements
    And connect me with co-workers who share this need
