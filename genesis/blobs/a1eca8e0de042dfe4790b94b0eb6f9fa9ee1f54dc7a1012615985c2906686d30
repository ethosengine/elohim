Scenario: Household privacy protected from service providers
    Given support workers and service providers enter Alex's household
    And this creates potential privacy vulnerabilities
    When household data is collected
    Then Alex should control what household information is shared with service providers
    And support workers should access only information necessary for their tasks
    And Alex's medical and personal information should remain private
    And household patterns should not be shared without Alex's consent
    And the household_elohim should protect Alex's privacy systematically
    And Alex should feel secure in their own home
    And privacy protections should be robust even with frequent visitors
