Scenario: Developer receives honest cost-benefit analysis
    Given a developer projects $5M annual tax revenue from proposed development
    But omits infrastructure costs and school capacity burden
    When the Observer provides independent analysis
    Then the developer sees: net tax impact only $800K after infrastructure costs
    And school enrollment increase requires $2M capacity expansion
    And traffic impacts need $1.5M intersection improvements
    And honest accounting reveals actual community trade-offs
    And realistic projections inform better civic decisions
