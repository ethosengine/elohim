Scenario: Activist exposes corporate lobbying influence
    Given a harmful environmental bill is advancing
    And the activist suspects industry capture
    When the Observer tracks lobbying and donations
    Then the activist sees which companies lobby for the bill
    And views campaign contributions to bill sponsors
    And identifies revolving door between industry and regulators
    And corruption patterns become documented
    And advocacy targets political vulnerabilities
