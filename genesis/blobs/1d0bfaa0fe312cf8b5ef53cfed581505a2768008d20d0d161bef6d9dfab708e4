Scenario: Turnover decreases dramatically as workers gain ownership and dignity
    Given franchise locations experienced 150% annual turnover due to low wages and poor conditions
    And constant turnover harmed service quality and training efficiency

    And institutional knowledge accumulates instead of constantly draining
    And training investments pay off through worker longevity
    And customer relationships deepen through consistent staffing
