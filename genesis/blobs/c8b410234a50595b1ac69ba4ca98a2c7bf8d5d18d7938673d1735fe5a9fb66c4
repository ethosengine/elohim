Feature: Regional Pattern Journalism for Journalist
  As a journalist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the county/regional governance layer
  I want pattern detection across jurisdictional boundaries
  So that regional investigations expose systemic issues

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the journalist user is registered in the system
    And the county_regional governance context is active

  Scenario: Journalist coordinates regional investigation across 15 municipalities
    Given affordable housing crisis affects entire metropolitan region
    And the journalist collaborates with reporters in neighboring coverage areas
    When the Observer provides civic surveillance across all municipalities
    Then journalists access comprehensive data from all 15 cities
    And identify common patterns in zoning and development approval
    And compare policy approaches and housing production outcomes
    And publish coordinated regional investigation
    And local stories reveal regional systemic failure

  Scenario: Journalist exposes developer's regional exploitation pattern
    Given a development firm proposes controversial project locally
    And uses familiar tactics the journalist suspects are standardized
    When the Observer tracks developer across regional jurisdictions
    Then the journalist sees same firm operating in 8 municipalities
    And documents pattern of community promises never fulfilled
    And identifies political contributions across region
    And finds environmental violations in 3 other states
    And publishes investigation warning other communities
    And regional surveillance exposes systematic bad actor

  Scenario: Journalist detects environmental racism at regional scale
    Given pollution facilities cluster in certain neighborhoods
    And the journalist investigates environmental justice
    When the Observer analyzes regional environmental patterns
    Then the journalist sees industrial permits concentrate in communities of color
    And maps proximity of pollution sources to schools and residences
    And documents health outcome disparities by neighborhood and race
    And shows pattern across county regardless of municipal boundaries
    And publishes investigation exposing regional environmental racism

  Scenario: Journalist investigates regional transit inequity
    Given transit access varies dramatically across metropolitan area
    And the journalist covers regional transit authority
    When the Observer analyzes transit service distribution
    Then the journalist sees frequent service to employment centers from white suburbs
    And finds infrequent service in communities of color despite higher ridership
    And documents decades of investment decisions favoring certain areas
    And compares stated equity goals to actual funding allocation
    And publishes accountability story on transit racism

  Scenario: Journalist tracks regional displacement and gentrification
    Given housing costs rise across metropolitan region
    And the journalist investigates who benefits and who is harmed
    When the Observer tracks displacement patterns regionally
    Then the journalist sees working-class communities of color losing residents
    And maps evictions, rent increases, and demographic changes
    And identifies corporate landlords buying properties across region
    And documents regional coordination of displacement
    And publishes investigation connecting local experiences to regional pattern

  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks regional economic development claims
    Given county officials tout major economic development success
    And claim massive job creation and tax revenue
    When the Observer analyzes economic development outcomes
    Then the journalist verifies jobs created are lower-wage than promised
    And finds tax incentives cost more than revenue generated
    And sees environmental violations and labor law violations
    And tracks development firm's record in other regions
    And publishes accountability story on corporate welfare
    And instant research exposes exaggerated claims

  Scenario: Journalist compares county policies to state and national patterns
    Given county debates approach to criminal justice reform
    And the journalist provides context on policy options
    When the Observer enables comparative policy research
    Then the journalist reviews outcomes from counties with reform policies
    And analyzes data on recidivism, cost, and community safety
    And interviews officials and residents in comparison jurisdictions
    And provides evidence-based policy journalism
    And regional coverage connects to national criminal justice debate
