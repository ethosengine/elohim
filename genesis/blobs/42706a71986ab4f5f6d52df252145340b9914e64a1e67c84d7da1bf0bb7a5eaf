Scenario: Connecting grocery shopping to ecological care economy
    Given Kenji shops for food on $50/week budget
    And food choices have ecological impact
    When the bioregional_elohim helps Kenji make food decisions
    Then it should show ecological impact of different food choices
    And it should help him identify low-impact foods within budget
    And it should recognize "Choosing dried beans over beef reduces ecological impact"
    And it should show how budget constraint can align with ecological care
    And the system should connect personal shopping to planetary stewardship
    And Kenji should see grocery choices as ecological care work
