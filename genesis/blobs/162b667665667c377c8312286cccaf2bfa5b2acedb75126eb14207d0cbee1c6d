Scenario: Remote care contributions to family of origin
    Given Aisha lives in a different city from her family
    And she wants to stay connected through care
    When Aisha helps her younger siblings with homework remotely
    Then the family_elohim should track her care contributions
    And care tokens should accumulate for her help
    And her parents should see her contributions
    And siblings should be able to request her help
    And the system should maintain family care bonds across distance
    And geographic separation shouldn't prevent care economy participation
