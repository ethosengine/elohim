Scenario: Understanding agent reasoning through appeal process
    Given I have filed an appeal against a Family Elohim decision
    And I don't understand why the agent made its choice
    When I request detailed explanation through the appeal interface
    Then I receive layered explanations from plain language to technical detail
    And I can see the constitutional principles the agent applied
    And I can view counterfactual scenarios showing what would change the outcome
    And I can access the cryptographic proof trail
    And Technical experts are available to explain complex aspects if needed
    And all explanations are in accessible language without jargon
