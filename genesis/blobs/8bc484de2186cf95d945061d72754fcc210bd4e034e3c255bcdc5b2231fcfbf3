Scenario: Child's gradual reach expansion through good judgment
    Given Emma has been using the system for 6 months
    And she consistently makes kind, thoughtful contributions
    And she helps her younger sibling with homework via the system
    And she shares creative work that delights her family
    When the guardian agent evaluates her demonstrated wisdom
    Then her reach is expanded to include vetted neighborhood children
    And her parents receive notification of the expanded access
    And Emma is congratulated for earning greater trust
    And she gains access to age-appropriate neighborhood activities
    And safety protections remain fully active
