Scenario: Explaining attack vectors and security risks
    Given appellant claims agent could be manipulated
    And council needs to understand vulnerability
    When I explain potential attack vectors
    Then I describe: how agents could be corrupted or gamed
    And I assess: likelihood and impact of different attacks
    And I explain: defense mechanisms in place
    And I acknowledge: residual risks that remain
    And I avoid: either dismissing concerns or creating panic
    And I provide: realistic risk assessment
    And council can: judge if security is adequate for constitutional governance
