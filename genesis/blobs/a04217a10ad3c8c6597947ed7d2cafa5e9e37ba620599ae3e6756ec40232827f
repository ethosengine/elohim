Scenario: Legislator distinguishes constituent calls from corporate astroturf
    Given the politician's office receives 500 calls opposing regulation
    And callers claim to be concerned constituents
    When the Observer analyzes campaign origins
    Then they see calls coordinated by corporate lobbying firm
    And identify script language and coordinated timing
    And distinguish 12 genuine constituent concerns from 488 manufactured contacts
    And understand industry opposition versus authentic community sentiment
    And vote based on constituent interests not manufactured pressure
