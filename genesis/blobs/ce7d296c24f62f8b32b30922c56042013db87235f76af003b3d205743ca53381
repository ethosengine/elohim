Scenario: Bioregional care economy connects households to land stewardship
    Given Sarah's household depends on bioregional ecological health
    And land stewardship is collective care work
    When Sarah participates in bioregional care economy
    Then the bioregional_elohim should connect her to land stewardship opportunities
    And it should link food purchases to regenerative agriculture
    And it should enable Sarah to support ecological restoration
    And care for land should be recognized as care work
    And bioregional care should extend beyond human relationships
