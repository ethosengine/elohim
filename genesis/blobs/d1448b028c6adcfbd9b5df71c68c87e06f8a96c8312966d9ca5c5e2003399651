Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult
  As a young adult new to my neighborhood
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to build community connections through care participation
  So that I establish roots and mutual support networks in a new place

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the young_adult user "Aisha" is registered in the system
    And Aisha recently moved to a new city for work
    And Aisha is learning her new neighborhood
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy
    And Aisha wants to build community from scratch

  Scenario: Discovering neighborhood through care economy participation
    Given Aisha is new to her neighborhood
    And she doesn't know local patterns yet
    When Aisha explores neighborhood resources
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should surface local care opportunities
    And it should identify local shops and services
    And it should highlight community initiatives she can join
    And the system should help her learn neighborhood geography through care
    And community building should happen through participation
    And she should discover her neighborhood as care network, not just location

  Scenario: Connecting with neighbors through shared shopping
    Given Aisha shops at local grocery stores
    And other neighbors shop at the same stores
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies potential connections
    Then it should suggest connecting with nearby residents
    And it should surface bulk buying opportunities
    And it should facilitate resource sharing among neighbors
    And introductions should be based on mutual care interests
    And the system should help build neighborhood relationships organically
    And community should form through practical cooperation

  Scenario: Joining neighborhood meal prep group
    Given a meal prep group is forming in Aisha's neighborhood
    And joining would reduce her time pressure and build community
    When the neighborhood_elohim surfaces the opportunity
    Then it should highlight the practical benefits
    And it should show how it fits her budget and time constraints
    And it should explain the care economy dimension
    And the system should facilitate her joining process
    And neighborhood participation should provide tangible value
    And community building should solve real problems

  Scenario: Contributing to neighborhood care economy as newcomer
    Given Aisha is new and has few connections
    And she wants to establish herself in the community
    When Aisha contributes to neighborhood initiatives
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should track her contributions
    And it should make her care work visible to neighbors
    And it should help her build social capital through care
    And early contributions should establish her as community participant
    And the system should help newcomers integrate through care economy
    And belonging should be earned through reciprocal care

  Scenario: Learning local shopping patterns from neighborhood data
    Given Aisha doesn't know the best local stores yet
    And neighborhood residents have collective knowledge
    When Aisha plans shopping trips
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should share aggregated local knowledge
    And it should identify best value stores for different items
    And it should suggest efficient shopping routes
    And it should reflect collective neighborhood wisdom
    And newcomers should benefit from community knowledge
    And local expertise should be shared through the system

  Scenario: Accessing neighborhood resource sharing networks
    Given neighbors share tools and resources
    And Aisha occasionally needs items she doesn't own
    When Aisha needs to borrow something
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect her to resource sharing
    And it should facilitate tool libraries and sharing arrangements
    And it should track care tokens for borrowing and lending
    And the system should build neighborhood mutual aid
    And resource sharing should reduce individual costs
    And neighborhood cooperation should meet practical needs

  Scenario: Participating in neighborhood sustainability initiatives
    Given the neighborhood has sustainability projects
    And Aisha wants to reduce environmental impact
    When Aisha joins local sustainability efforts
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate her participation
    And it should connect her to composting, recycling, or garden projects
    And it should recognize her environmental care work
    And neighborhood-level sustainability should be more effective than individual
    And collective action should be facilitated through care economy
    And environmental stewardship should build community

  Scenario: Building neighborhood safety through mutual care
    Given neighborhoods are safer when residents know each other
    And Aisha wants to feel secure in her new home
    When Aisha participates in neighborhood care networks
    Then the connections should build mutual familiarity
    And the neighborhood_elohim should strengthen social fabric
    And care relationships should create natural neighborhood watch
    And safety should emerge from community bonds
    And the system should build security through care, not surveillance

  Scenario: Neighborhood care economy helps young adult on tight budget
    Given Aisha has limited financial resources
    And neighborhood cooperation can reduce costs
    When Aisha participates in neighborhood care economy
    Then bulk buying should reduce her grocery costs
    And resource sharing should reduce acquisition needs
    And skill exchanges should replace paid services
    And the neighborhood_elohim should identify cost-saving opportunities
    And community participation should improve financial sustainability
    And care economy should make tight budgets more livable

  Scenario: Learning neighborhood cultural context through participation
    Given Aisha's neighborhood has particular cultural character
    And she's learning local norms and values
    When Aisha engages neighborhood care economy
    Then she should learn cultural patterns through participation
    And the neighborhood_elohim should respect local culture
    And her contributions should adapt to neighborhood context
    And cultural integration should happen through care relationships
    And the system should facilitate culturally appropriate participation

  Scenario: Neighborhood connection reduces isolation for young adult
    Given Aisha moved to a new city alone
    And social isolation is a risk for young adults
    When Aisha builds neighborhood care relationships
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate meaningful connections
    And care-based relationships should reduce loneliness
    And practical cooperation should create authentic community
    And the system should address isolation through care economy
    And neighborhood bonds should provide social support
    And belonging should emerge from reciprocal care

  Scenario: Neighborhood governance participation as new resident
    Given the neighborhood makes collective decisions
    And Aisha is a new resident
    When neighborhood governance processes occur
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate her participation
    And newcomers should have voice proportional to care contributions
    And she should learn how neighborhood decision-making works
    And participation should be accessible to new residents
    And the system should help her become active neighborhood citizen
    And care economy should give her legitimate standing in governance
