Scenario: Foraging and wild food knowledge
    Given Margaret may know local wild and foraged foods
    And foraging connects people to bioregion and reduces food costs
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates wild food knowledge
    Then Margaret's foraging knowledge should be recognized
    And safe foraging practices should be shared
    And wild food resources should be sustainably utilized
    And bioregional food diversity should be enhanced
    And Margaret's knowledge should strengthen food security
    And connection to land should be deepened through foraging
