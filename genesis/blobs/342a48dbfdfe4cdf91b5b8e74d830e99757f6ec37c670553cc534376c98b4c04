Scenario: Board member learns accessible expertise on special education compliance
    Given district faces federal monitoring for special education compliance issues
    And board must oversee corrective action plan with complex legal requirements
    And board member has no special education or legal background
    When the board member uses Observer to understand the situation
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of IDEA requirements and violations
    And see comparison of district's special education outcomes to state averages
    And access key questions to ask superintendent about implementation capacity
    And get examples of how other districts achieved compliance
    And accessible expertise enables informed oversight without full-time study
