Scenario: Workers coordinate sector response to corporate competitive pressure
    Given a corporate chain attempts to undercut EAE entities on price
    And individual entities cannot match corporate predatory pricing alone
    When workers detect the competitive threat
    Then industry_sector_elohim alerts all sector workers
    And workers coordinate response emphasizing quality and values
    And workers develop public narrative about democratic vs. extractive business
    And sector pools marketing resources to compete collectively
    And coordinated response succeeds where isolated entities would fail
