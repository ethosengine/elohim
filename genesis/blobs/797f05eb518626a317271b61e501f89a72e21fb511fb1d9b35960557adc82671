Scenario: Advocating for neighborhood accessibility improvements
    Given Jordan notices the sidewalk has a dangerous crack
    And the broken sidewalk creates barriers for Jordan and others
    When Jordan reports the accessibility issue
    Then the personal_agent helps Jordan document the problem
    And the neighborhood_elohim routes the report to appropriate authorities
    And Jordan's advocacy contributes to universal accessibility
    And the repair benefits Jordan and other neighbors with mobility challenges
    And Jordan experiences being an active citizen advocating for community
    And Jordan's voice influences neighborhood infrastructure
