Scenario: Building neighborhood resilience through worker solidarity
    Given many neighbors are also workers with similar constraints
    When workers connect and support each other
    Then the protocol should facilitate worker mutual aid networks
    And coordinate support systems designed for workers' schedules
    And build neighborhood culture of worker solidarity
    And demonstrate that care economy serves workers' needs
