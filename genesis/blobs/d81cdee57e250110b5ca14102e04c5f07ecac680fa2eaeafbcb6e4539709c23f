Scenario: Walking assistance from neighborhood volunteers
    Given Helen's mobility makes walking difficult
    And she needs assistance to remain active in neighborhood
    When neighborhood volunteers offer walking support
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate volunteer schedules
    And volunteers should be matched based on availability and compatibility
    And Helen's preferences should guide volunteer matching
    And volunteer care work should be recognized with care tokens
    And Helen should experience companionship, not charity
    And the protocol should build reciprocal neighbor relationships
    And neighborhood support should enable continued engagement
