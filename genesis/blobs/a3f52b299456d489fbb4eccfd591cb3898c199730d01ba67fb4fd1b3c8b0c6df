Scenario: Continued intellectual engagement prevents cognitive decline
    Given cognitive engagement supports brain health in aging
    And intellectual isolation accelerates decline
    When Helen participates in learning and teaching
    Then educational engagement should be recognized as health intervention
    And community should support elder intellectual life
    And learning opportunities should be accessible and meaningful
    And the protocol should demonstrate that education serves health in aging
    And Helen should remain intellectually engaged
    And cognitive health should be supported through educational participation
    And investment in elder learning should be justified by health outcomes
