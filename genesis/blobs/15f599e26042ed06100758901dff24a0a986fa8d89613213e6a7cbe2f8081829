Scenario: Making post-employment care contributions visible at individual level
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity
    And he provides occasional grandchild care
    And he helps maintain his mother-in-law's home
    And he serves on his neighborhood council
    When Frank's care contributions are tracked
    Then his personal_agent should quantify all volunteer and care labor
    And it should calculate market value (~$20k/year construction volunteer work)
    And it should accumulate care tokens for all contributions
    And it should make visible that he's highly productive post-retirement
    And Frank should experience himself as valuable contributor, not "not working"
    And the data should counter cultural narrative of retired as obsolete
    And his contributions should be recognized across multiple contexts
