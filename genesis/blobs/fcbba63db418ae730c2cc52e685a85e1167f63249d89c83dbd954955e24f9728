Scenario: Developer environmental review gains honest analysis
    Given a developer's environmental impact report claims minimal impacts
    And used consultant known for developer-friendly assessments
    When the Observer provides independent environmental analysis
    Then comparison shows: wetland impacts understated by 60%
    And habitat loss affects threatened species not mentioned
    And stormwater runoff calculations omit downstream impacts
    And independent assessment reveals actual environmental costs
    And rubber-stamp reviews face evidence-based scrutiny
