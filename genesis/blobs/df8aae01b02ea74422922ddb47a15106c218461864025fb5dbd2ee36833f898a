Scenario: Teacher documents unpaid overtime and workload
    Given teachers work far beyond contracted hours
    And administration claims workload is reasonable
    When teachers track actual working hours through Observer
    Then aggregated data shows teachers average 52 hours weekly vs 40 contracted
    And 12 hours weekly of unpaid overtime is documented
    And workload breakdown reveals what consumes time (grading, paperwork, meetings)
    And union uses evidence in contract negotiations for compensation or reduction
    And working conditions transparency creates accountability pressure
