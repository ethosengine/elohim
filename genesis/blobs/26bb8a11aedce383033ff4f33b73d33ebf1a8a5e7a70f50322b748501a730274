Scenario: Participating in community food systems
    Given I work in food preparation and understand food systems
    And community has food co-ops, gardens, or alternative food access
    When I participate in community food initiatives
    Then the protocol should recognize my expertise and contribution
    And help me access affordable, quality food through community systems
    And accumulate care tokens for food systems participation
    And support building community food sovereignty
