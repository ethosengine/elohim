Scenario: Organizer identifies living wage campaign opportunity
    Given city council will consider minimum wage ordinance
    And workers struggle with poverty wages despite full-time work
    When the Observer surfaces the organizing opportunity
    Then the organizer sees local wage patterns and living wage gap
    And identifies which workers and communities are most affected
    And gets analysis showing public subsidies to low-wage employers
    And receives alert early enough to organize worker-community coalition
    And municipal wage policy becomes organizing opportunity
