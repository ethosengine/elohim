Feature: Neighborhood Care Participation for Workers
  As a worker living in a neighborhood
  I need to participate in neighborhood care economy when possible
  So that I can contribute to and benefit from local community resilience

  Background:
    Given I am a worker living in a neighborhood
    And my work schedule limits my availability for neighborhood participation
    And the neighborhood operates a care economy system
    And my contributions are recognized even when limited

  Scenario: Participating in neighborhood mutual aid despite time limits
    Given my neighborhood has mutual aid networks
    And I have minimal time due to work demands
    When I want to participate in neighborhood care economy
    Then the protocol should identify micro-opportunities for contribution
    And help me participate in ways that fit my schedule
    And recognize that small contributions matter
    And connect me to neighborhood resources when I need support

  Scenario: Shopping locally to support neighborhood economy
    Given I need to buy groceries and household items
    And local businesses are part of neighborhood care economy
    When I shop for necessities
    Then the protocol should identify accessible local businesses
    And recognize that shopping locally is care economy participation
    And show me how my purchases support neighborhood resilience
    And accumulate care tokens for supporting local commerce

  Scenario: Accessing neighborhood food resources during tight budget periods
    Given neighborhood has community gardens, food co-ops, or meal programs
    And my budget is extremely tight some periods
    When I need food support
    Then the protocol should connect me to neighborhood food resources
    And help me access support with dignity based on my care contributions
    And recognize that my work serves community (I am not taking charity)
    And facilitate reciprocal care economy participation

  Scenario: Building relationships with neighbors despite time constraints
    Given neighborhood resilience depends on connection between residents
    And my work schedule limits social time
    When I have brief moments available
    Then the protocol should help me build neighbor relationships
    And suggest low-time ways to connect and contribute
    And recognize that presence and greeting count as care
    And support neighborhood social fabric even with limited participation

  Scenario: Contributing skills to neighborhood when available
    Given I have food preparation skills from my restaurant work
    And neighbors might benefit from these skills
    When I have rare free time
    Then the protocol should help me share skills with neighborhood
    And coordinate skill-sharing or teaching opportunities
    And accumulate care tokens for skill contribution
    And build neighborhood capacity through skill distribution

  Scenario: Participating in neighborhood emergency response
    Given neighborhoods need mutual aid during emergencies
    When crisis occurs and I am not working
    Then the protocol should help me contribute to emergency response
    And coordinate with neighbors for mutual support
    And recognize my contribution to neighborhood resilience
    And ensure I can also access support during my emergencies

  Scenario: Accessing neighborhood time-banking system
    Given neighborhood operates time-banking for service exchange
    And I accumulate time credits through my work and contributions
    When I need services I cannot afford to purchase
    Then the protocol should connect me to time-banking opportunities
    And help me exchange my labor/skills for needed services
    And facilitate reciprocal care economy without money exchange
    And recognize that care economy can operate beyond cash

  Scenario: Coordinating with neighbors for transportation
    Given I may not have reliable transportation
    And neighbors might share rides or have vehicles available
    When I need transportation for work, shopping, or other needs
    Then the protocol should help coordinate neighborhood ride-sharing
    And track reciprocal transportation support
    And reduce individual costs through sharing
    And build neighborhood care economy through mutual aid

  Scenario: Supporting neighborhood care infrastructure
    Given neighborhood has community spaces, gardens, or shared resources
    When I have time to contribute to maintaining shared infrastructure
    Then the protocol should recognize this as care contribution
    And coordinate volunteer opportunities that fit my schedule
    And accumulate care tokens for infrastructure support
    And help build neighborhood commons that benefit all residents

  Scenario: Advocating for worker-friendly neighborhood policies
    Given neighborhood governance makes decisions affecting workers
    When policies could support workers' care needs and participation
    Then the protocol should help me participate in neighborhood advocacy
    And connect me with other workers for collective voice
    And support advocacy for worker-supportive policies
    And build neighborhood culture that values workers' care needs

  Scenario: Making visible that work schedules limit neighborhood participation
    Given many neighborhood activities happen during work hours
    When my work schedule prevents participation
    Then the protocol should make visible that employment structures exclude workers
    And advocate for neighborhood activities at accessible times
    And help neighborhood understand workers' constraints
    And push for inclusive neighborhood care economy design

  Scenario: Building neighborhood resilience through worker solidarity
    Given many neighbors are also workers with similar constraints
    When workers connect and support each other
    Then the protocol should facilitate worker mutual aid networks
    And coordinate support systems designed for workers' schedules
    And build neighborhood culture of worker solidarity
    And demonstrate that care economy serves workers' needs
