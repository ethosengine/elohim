Scenario: Connection to community resources without stigma
    Given Marcus's family needs support
    And traditional social services often involve stigma
    When Marcus accesses community resources
    Then the protocol should preserve his dignity completely
    And he should not feel like he's receiving charity
    And the framing should always be reciprocal care exchange
    And his contributions should be valued genuinely
    And community support should strengthen rather than shame
    And care economy should eliminate stigma from receiving help
