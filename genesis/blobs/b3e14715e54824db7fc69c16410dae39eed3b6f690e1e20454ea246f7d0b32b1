Scenario: Managing tight budget for individual needs
    Given I earn $32k/year and have $60/week food budget
    And I need to maximize nutritional value per dollar
    When I plan my grocery shopping
    Then the protocol should provide sophisticated budget optimization
    And suggest high-value nutritious ingredients
    And identify sales and discounts at accessible stores
    And help me stretch limited resources without sacrificing health
