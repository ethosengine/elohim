Scenario: Family care economy includes elderly in reciprocal network
    Given the family participates in care token economy
    And Helen both receives and gives care
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Helen's contributions should be valued alongside her care receipt
    And her lifetime of family care should be visible
    And current care she receives should be framed as reciprocity
    And family care economy should show mutual support, not one-way dependency
    And Helen should have standing in family based on accumulated contributions
    And the protocol should demonstrate that care flows throughout entire lifespan
    And family economics should value elders as continuing participants
