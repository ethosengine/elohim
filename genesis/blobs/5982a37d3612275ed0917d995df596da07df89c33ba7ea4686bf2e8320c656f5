Scenario: Coordinating legal family governance with abusive ex-partner
    Given I am navigating custody, protective orders, and child support with my abuser
    And I need to minimize contact while managing legal obligations
    When legal family governance requires communication
    Then the family_elohim helps me manage legally-required communication only
    And provides templates for documented, bounded interactions
    And tracks all communications for legal purposes
    And helps me maintain protective boundaries while meeting legal requirements
    And alerts me to concerning patterns or escalation
    And my personal_agent coaches me through high-stress legal interactions
    And recognizes this boundary management as substantial emotional labor
    And validates that minimizing contact while co-parenting is appropriate
