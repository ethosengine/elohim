Scenario: Recognition prompts build mother-son relationship
    Given Sarah has limited time with Marcus
    And their relationship could be strained by her absence and his burden
    When the family_elohim generates recognition prompts
    Then prompts should facilitate positive connection moments
    And Sarah should be given specific appreciations to express
    And Marcus should receive recognition from Sarah, not just system
    And their relationship should be strengthened by care visibility
    And prompts should create opportunities for bonding
    And love should be communicated despite difficult circumstances
