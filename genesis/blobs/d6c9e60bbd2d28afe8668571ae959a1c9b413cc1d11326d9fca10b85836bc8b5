Scenario: Escalated appeal reaches Regional Constitutional Council
    Given my appeal couldn't be resolved at community layer
    And I escalated to peer agent review which affirmed the decision
    When I request Constitutional Council review at regional level
    Then randomly-selected citizens from across the region review my case
    And They include Sarah Martinez, a nurse serving her 3-month term
    And They deliberate for substantive time (2+ hours for complex cases)
    And They have access to technical experts to explain complex aspects
    And They create precedent that affects multiple communities in the region
    And I receive judgment within one month of reaching this layer
    And The decision includes detailed constitutional reasoning
