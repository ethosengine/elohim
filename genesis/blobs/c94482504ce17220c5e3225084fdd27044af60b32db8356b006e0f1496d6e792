Scenario: Household care tokens reflect combined retirement contributions
    Given household participates in care token economy
    And both partners contribute substantial volunteer and family care
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then tokens should accumulate from both partners' contributions
    And Frank's Habitat work should be valued appropriately
    And his wife's care contributions should be recognized
    And household should receive care token supplements for low fixed income
    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status
    And combined contributions should create household care economy resources
