Scenario: Manager receives liberation from moral injury of implementing exploitation
    Given Marcus previously enforced corporate extraction policies
    And he experienced stress from implementing exploitation he knew was harmful
    When ChickenMax converts to EAE democratic ownership
    Then Marcus is offered choice to transition or exit with dignified severance
    And if he chooses to stay, his role shifts from enforcing extraction to facilitating coordination
    And he no longer implements policies harming workers he knows
    And his stress levels decrease measurably (lower cortisol, better sleep)
    And workplace_elohim documents his transition from extraction to service
