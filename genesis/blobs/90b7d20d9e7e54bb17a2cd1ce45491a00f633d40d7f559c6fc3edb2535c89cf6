Scenario: Cross-cultural family appeal about care norms
    Given our family's cultural background has different care expectations
    And Family Elohim applied default protocol assumptions
    When I appeal that the decision didn't respect our cultural context
    Then the Constitutional Council considers cultural specificity in family care
    And They evaluate if the agent accommodated legitimate cultural variation
    And They distinguish cultural respect from cultural relativism about harm
    And They examine if our family could calibrate agent to our values
    And The appeal supports cultural diversity within constitutional bounds
    And Family Elohim learns to honor multiple models of family care
