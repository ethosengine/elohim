Scenario: Different pedagogical approaches for different children
    Given Tommy (5) needs wonder-preservation pedagogy
    And Emma (8) needs autonomy-building instruction
    When Sarah teaches her children with different approaches
    Then the educational_elohim should recognize pedagogical sophistication
    And it should value Sarah's ability to differentiate instruction
    And teaching multiple children at different stages should be recognized as complex
    And Sarah's educational expertise should be documented
    And the system should recognize professional-grade teaching capability
    And differentiated instruction should be valued as advanced skill
