Scenario: Accessing workplace accommodations for care needs
    Given I may need accommodations for health, family, or care responsibilities
    When I need to request workplace accommodations
    Then the workplace_elohim should help me understand my rights
    And support me in making formal accommodation requests
    And provide guidance on documentation and process
    And advocate for my right to work conditions that don't destroy my capacity for care
