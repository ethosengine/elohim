Feature: Intergenerational Family Connection for Elder
  As an elder in the social_medium system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to maintain meaningful relationships with my family across distances
  So that I remain connected with children and grandchildren despite geographic separation

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elder user is registered in the system
    And the family governance context is active
    And the elder is Rose, age 73, with family across three states

  Scenario: Elder shares family wisdom with grandchildren
    Given Rose's granddaughter Emma asks about Rose's childhood during WWII
    When Rose creates a contribution sharing her memories
    And she includes photos from her family album
    And she describes what life was like during wartime
    Then the contribution reaches all family members immediately
    And Emma learns family history and develops deeper connection
    And other grandchildren engage with questions and appreciation
    And Rose experiences meaningful intergenerational exchange
    And the family history is preserved in the network

  Scenario: Elder protected from romance scam while maintaining real connections
    Given Rose has been widowed for two years
    When a scammer creates a fake profile and tries to contact her
    And the scammer sends romantic messages requesting financial help
    Then the guardian agent detects the fraudulent pattern
    And the messages never reach Rose
    And she is protected without knowing she was targeted
    And all her genuine family and friend connections work normally
    And her dignity and autonomy are fully preserved

  Scenario: Elder stays connected to grandchild's daily life
    Given Emma shares her school activities and achievements
    When Emma posts about her science fair project
    And she shares photos of her display
    Then Rose sees Emma's contribution in family stream
    And Rose can respond with encouragement and pride
    And Emma feels her grandmother's support despite distance
    And the family bond strengthens through regular positive interaction
    And Rose remains engaged with grandchildren's lives

  Scenario: Elder reaches out during health concern
    Given Rose is feeling unwell and wants family support
    When she creates a contribution mentioning she's not feeling well
    And the guardian agent detects health concern indicators
    Then her children are notified appropriately
    And family members can coordinate support and check-ins
    And if needed, healthcare resources are surfaced
    And Rose experiences family care without having to explicitly ask for help
    And the system respects her privacy while enabling family support
