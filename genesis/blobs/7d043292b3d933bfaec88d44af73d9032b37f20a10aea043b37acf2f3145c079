# Economic Coordination: Beyond Markets and States

## The Coordination Question

Every society must answer: How do we decide who does what, and who gets what?

**Traditional answers:**
- **Markets**: Price signals coordinate through exchange
- **States**: Central authority coordinates through command
- **Communities**: Norms and relationships coordinate through reciprocity

Each has strengths and failures. The Elohim Protocol combines them.

## Why Current Coordination Fails

### Market Failures
Markets work well for many things. They fail when:
- **Externalities**: Costs imposed on others (pollution, inequality)
- **Public goods**: Benefits can't be captured by providers (clean air, basic research)
- **Information asymmetry**: One party knows more than another (used cars, healthcare)
- **Power imbalances**: Negotiation isn't between equals (labor markets)
- **Care and relationships**: Value destroyed by commodification

### State Failures
Central coordination works for some things. It fails when:
- **Information overload**: Planners can't know everything
- **Incentive misalignment**: Bureaucrats serve bureaucracy
- **Capture**: Regulated become regulators
- **Rigidity**: Rules can't adapt to context
- **Distance**: Those affected aren't those deciding

### Community Failures
Relational coordination works at small scale. It fails when:
- **Scale**: Can't coordinate millions
- **Exit**: Trapped in bad communities
- **Enforcement**: Free riders exploit goodwill
- **Insularity**: In-groups exclude others

## The Elohim Synthesis

The Elohim Protocol doesn't choose between these. It layers them:

### Markets Where They Work
Let prices coordinate where they're effective:
- Commodities with clear ownership
- Arms-length transactions
- Competitive provision

### State Where It Works
Let public authority coordinate where it's needed:
- Rights protection
- Public goods provision
- Regulation of harmful externalities

### Community Where It Works
Let relationships coordinate where they're appropriate:
- Care and support
- Local knowledge problems
- Trust-dependent activities

### AI to Bridge Them
Your Elohim helps navigate:
- What coordination mode is appropriate here?
- How do I participate in each?
- Where are the failure modes?
- How do we improve the mix?

## What This Looks Like

### Scenario: Childcare
**Current coordination failures:**
- Market: Too expensive, quality varies, care commodified
- State: Bureaucratic, inflexible, underfunded
- Community: Inconsistent, gendered, burns out caregivers

**Elohim coordination:**
- **Value recognition**: REA tracking makes care visible
- **Reciprocity networks**: Care exchanged across families
- **Public support**: State resources flow to recognized care
- **Market supplement**: Professional care for specialized needs
- **AI assistance**: Your Elohim helps coordinate schedules, match needs

### Scenario: Local Business
**Current coordination failures:**
- Market: Big box stores and Amazon dominate
- State: Regulations favor scale
- Community: Can't match convenience

**Elohim coordination:**
- **Visibility**: Local value flows are visible
- **Preference aggregation**: Communities express what they want
- **Matching**: AI connects needs with local providers
- **Reputation**: Trust networks vouch for quality
- **Support flows**: Community currencies keep value local

## For Policy Makers: Enabling Mixed Coordination

Policy can enable or obstruct coordination modes:

### Enabling
- Legal recognition for diverse organizational forms
- Infrastructure for community coordination
- Interoperability requirements for platforms
- Support for care and commons

### Obstructing
- Regulatory capture by incumbents
- Tax structures that favor extraction
- Intellectual property that blocks sharing
- Procurement that requires scale

## For Developers: Coordination Infrastructure

Technical requirements:
- **Value tracking**: REA accounting for all flows
- **Identity**: Consistent across coordination modes
- **Matching**: Connect needs with providers
- **Reputation**: Trust that works across contexts
- **Governance**: Who decides which mode applies

## For Everyone: Participating in Coordination

You're already part of multiple coordination systems:
- Market: As consumer, producer, worker
- State: As citizen, taxpayer, beneficiary
- Community: As neighbor, family member, friend

The Elohim Protocol makes these visible and improvable.

## Connection to Value Flows

Coordination requires tracking value. The next unit explores how the Elohim Protocol tracks value flows—the REA accounting that makes coordination visible.
