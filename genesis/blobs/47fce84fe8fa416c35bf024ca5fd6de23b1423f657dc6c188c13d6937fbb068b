Scenario: Student contribution to neighborhood safety and mutual care
    Given Kenji walks neighborhood streets regularly
    And neighborhood safety is collective responsibility
    When Kenji participates in neighborhood mutual care
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize his watchfulness
    And it should value informal safety contributions: checking on neighbors, reporting issues
    And it should accumulate care tokens for neighborhood care work
    And students should be recognized as safety contributors, not threats
    And the system should value informal mutual aid
    And neighborhood care should be understood as everyone's work
