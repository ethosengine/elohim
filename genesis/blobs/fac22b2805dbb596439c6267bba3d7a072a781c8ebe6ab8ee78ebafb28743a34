Scenario: Walking and public transit use reduces carbon footprint
    Given Margaret can no longer afford car ownership
    And walking/transit use serves ecological goals
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks transportation patterns
    Then Margaret's low-carbon mobility should be recognized
    And walking should be valued as ecological choice
    And public transit use should be supported and facilitated
    And her mobility patterns should serve bioregional sustainability
    And car-free living should be honored as ecological stewardship
    And economic constraint should be reframed as ecological virtue
