Scenario: Accessing community recreational programs inclusively
    Given the community rec center offers adaptive sports programs
    And Jordan loves playing basketball
    When Jordan joins the adaptive basketball league
    Then registration uses accessible language and processes
    And Jordan participates in the sport at their capability level
    And coaches treat Jordan as an athlete, not a charity case
    And Jordan's teammates are peers with various abilities
    And Jordan's athletic participation contributes to team success
    And Jordan experiences joy, competition, and physical activity
    And Jordan's community participation is normalized, not special
