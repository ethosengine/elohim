Scenario: Personal values clarified through complex care decisions
    Given Robert makes difficult decisions about care allocation
    And he must choose between competing legitimate needs
    When he faces value conflicts through his personal_agent
    Then it should help him articulate his core values
    And surface patterns in his decisions
    And recognize: "You've consistently prioritized parent care over children's wants"
    And support him in examining whether his choices align with his values
    And provide space for reflection on what matters most
    And help him develop coherent personal philosophy about care responsibilities
    And respect his authority to define his own values
