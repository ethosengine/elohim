Scenario: Comparing national adoption across different political systems
    Given different nations with different political systems adopted protocol
    And I want to understand how political context shapes implementation
    When I conduct cross-national comparative analysis
    Then I examine: adoption patterns in democracies vs mixed regimes
    And I analyze: how existing institutions integrate or resist protocol
    And I explore: whether protocol strengthens or threatens existing power structures
    And I assess: cultural factors that predict adoption success
    And I identify: universal patterns vs context-dependent adaptations
    And My research tests: whether democratic AI governance is culturally specific or universal
    And Findings inform: international adoption strategies and expectations
