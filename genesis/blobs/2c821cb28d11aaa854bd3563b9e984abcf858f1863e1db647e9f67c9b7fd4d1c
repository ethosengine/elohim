Scenario: Valuing diverse ways of being extends to all life
    Given disability justice rejects hierarchy of human worth
    And this principle extends to ecological relationships
    When the bioregional_elohim represents ecological values
    Then it should embody recognition of intrinsic worth across difference
    And diversity should be valued, not just tolerated
    And interdependence should be centered as strength
    And disability justice frameworks should inform ecological ethics
    And Alex's understanding of diversity as value should shape environmental thinking
    And the protocol should learn from disability community wisdom
    And respect for difference should extend from people to ecosystems
