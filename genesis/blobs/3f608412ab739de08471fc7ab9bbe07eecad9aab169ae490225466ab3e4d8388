Scenario: Investment supports indigenous land back and traditional ecological knowledge
    Given indigenous peoples have traditional ecological knowledge and land stewardship practices
    And Patricia values supporting indigenous sovereignty and ecological wisdom
    When community investment supports indigenous land back initiatives
    Then capital helps indigenous communities reacquire traditional territories
    And traditional ecological knowledge informs bioregional stewardship
    And investment repairs colonial land theft while supporting ecological regeneration
    And indigenous governance of land improves bioregional ecological health
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates respectful indigenous partnership and investment
