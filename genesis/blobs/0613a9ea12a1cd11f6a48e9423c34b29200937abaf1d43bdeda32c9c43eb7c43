Scenario: Protecting children's relationship with abusive parent when legally required
    Given my children have court-ordered visitation with their abusive parent
    And I need to support children's wellbeing within legal constraints
    When children navigate relationship with abusive parent
    Then the family_elohim helps me prepare children appropriately
    And tracks children's responses to visitation
    And helps me support children's processing of complex feelings
    And documents concerning behaviors for legal purposes if needed
    And connects me to resources on supporting children through this
    And my personal_agent reminds me of safety protocols around visitation
    And recognizes my emotional labor supporting children through this trauma
    And validates that my protective responses are appropriate
