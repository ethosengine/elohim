Scenario: Teaching includes ecological care appropriate to age
    Given care economy extends beyond human relationships
    And environmental stewardship is part of value literacy
    When Tommy learns about care through the scanner
    Then ecological care should be introduced at concrete level
    And Tommy should learn "Taking care of our food" (not abstract sustainability)
    And connections between care for people and care for environment should begin
    And age-appropriate environmental consciousness should develop
    And foundations for ecological stewardship should be laid
