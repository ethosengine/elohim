Scenario: My service inspires future generations' democratic participation
    Given my children watched my constitutional council journey
    And they see democracy as participation not just voting
    When they grow up understanding governance as shared responsibility
    Then they develop: civic capacities through my example
    And they believe: they too can shape their world
    And they practice: deliberation, constitutional thinking, humble judgment
    And they inherit: democracy as living practice not dead tradition
    And next generation: is prepared for governance challenges ahead
    And my service: ripples through time beyond my individual contribution
    And I know: this is how democracy perpetuates itself
