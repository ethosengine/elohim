Scenario: Organizer holds city council accountable for campaign promises
    Given council member promised affordable housing support during campaign
    And the organizer's coalition delivered volunteer support and votes
    When the council member votes on housing policy
    Then the Observer tracks their votes against commitments
    And shows the organizer their complete voting record
    And provides evidence for accountability conversations
    And makes politician's record visible to organized constituents
    And electoral support creates ongoing accountability relationship
