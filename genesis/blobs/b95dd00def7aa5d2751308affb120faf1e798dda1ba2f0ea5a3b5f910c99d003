Scenario: Coordinating bulk buying to maximize household budget efficiency
    Given Kenji and roommates each have limited grocery budgets
    And bulk buying saves money but requires coordination
    When Kenji proposes coordinated bulk purchase of rice, beans, and cooking oil
    Then the household_elohim should facilitate group buying coordination
    And it should track who pays what and how costs are divided
    And it should calculate savings: "Bulk rice saves each person $8/month"
    And it should help roommates see financial benefit of coordination
    And the system should reduce friction in shared purchasing
    And collective buying should be easy and fair
