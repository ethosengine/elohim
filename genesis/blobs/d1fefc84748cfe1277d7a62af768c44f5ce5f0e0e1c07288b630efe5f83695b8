Scenario: Escalating appeal when initial review doesn't satisfy
    Given my Community Elohim review upheld the original decision
    And I still believe my constitutional rights were violated
    When I choose to escalate to peer agent review
    Then three randomly-selected Family Elohim agents from other families review my case
    And A Constitutional Council observer monitors the peer review
    And The peer agents investigate deeper than the original review
    And They can override, modify, or affirm the original decision
    And I receive their judgment within one week
    And I retain the right to escalate further to Constitutional Council if needed
