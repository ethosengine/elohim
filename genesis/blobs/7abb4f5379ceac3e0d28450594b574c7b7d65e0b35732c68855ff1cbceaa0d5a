Scenario: Activist builds budget justice coalition across issues
    Given multiple communities face budget cuts affecting different services
    And the activist works on housing but sees connections
    When the Observer reveals municipal budget priorities
    Then the activist sees cuts to housing, transit, libraries, and social services
    And identifies shared interest across issue silos
    And facilitates coalition of housing, transit, and education advocates
    And budget fight becomes coordinated multi-issue campaign
    And fragmented advocacy becomes unified power
