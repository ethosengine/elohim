Scenario: Evaluating national policy impact on protocol outcomes
    Given Senator Ruiz passed legislation supporting protocol adoption
    And I want to assess whether policy actually improved outcomes
    When I analyze communities before and after policy implementation
    Then I examine: whether funding increased adoption rates
    And I assess: whether legal recognition improved legitimacy
    And I measure: whether infrastructure support reduced access barriers
    And I explore: whether regulatory protection prevented capture
    And I identify: which policy mechanisms worked and which didn't
    And My evaluation provides: evidence for continued funding and policy refinement
    And Research serves: accountability and improvement of democratic policy
