Scenario: Recognition as capable contributor not just cute helper
    Given Emma has made a budget-conscious choice
    And she selected store brand cereal to save money
    When the transaction is complete
    Then the recognition should be specific and substantive
    And her personal_agent should say "Your choice saved $2, which helped the family stay within budget"
    And the feedback should acknowledge real impact
    And Emma should not receive patronizing praise
    And her contribution should be valued as genuine stewardship
    And she should build identity as capable resource manager
    And recognition should reflect that her work actually matters
