Scenario: Participating in family decisions from distance
    Given Aisha is geographically distant from family
    And important family decisions need her input
    When the family makes significant decisions
    Then the family_elohim should facilitate remote participation
    And Aisha's input should be solicited appropriately
    And her adult perspective should be valued
    And technology should enable genuine participation
    And distance shouldn't exclude her from family governance
    And her independent status should give her legitimate voice
