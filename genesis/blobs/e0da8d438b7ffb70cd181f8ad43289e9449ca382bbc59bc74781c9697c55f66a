Scenario: Privacy protection with emerging concept of data awareness
    Given Emma's choices and decision patterns are being tracked
    And she is beginning to understand privacy concepts
    When Emma's data is collected
    Then all data must stay encrypted on family devices
    And no commercial exploitation should occur
    And Emma should receive age-appropriate education about privacy
    And she should learn why data protection matters
    And the agent should explain "Your information is private and protected"
    And Emma should begin understanding data as something to steward
    And consent education should begin at this developmental stage
