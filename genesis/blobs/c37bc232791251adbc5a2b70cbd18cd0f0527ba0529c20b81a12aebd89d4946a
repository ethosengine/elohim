Scenario: Operating as junior partner in family governance
    Given Marcus makes real decisions about family resources
    And Sarah maintains ultimate parental authority
    When family governance decisions are made
    Then Marcus should be treated as junior partner, not dependent
    And his judgment should be increasingly trusted
    And the family_elohim should coordinate their partnership
    And Marcus's autonomy should grow with demonstrated capability
    And Sarah should maintain oversight without micromanaging
    And the balance should reflect his developmental stage
    And partnership model should prevent both parentification and infantilization
