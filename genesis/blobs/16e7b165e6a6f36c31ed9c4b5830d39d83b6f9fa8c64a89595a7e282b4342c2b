Scenario: Seasonal pattern knowledge from decades of observation
    Given Helen has observed local seasonal patterns for 82 years
    And climate change is altering traditional seasonal cycles
    When Helen shares knowledge of historical seasonal patterns
    Then her observations should inform understanding of climate shifts
    And bioregional planning should incorporate elder memory
    And changes should be documented through personal testimony
    And Helen should be recognized as expert on local ecology
    And the protocol should preserve knowledge of pre-change conditions
    And ecological governance should include elder perspectives
    And baseline understanding should come from those who remember
