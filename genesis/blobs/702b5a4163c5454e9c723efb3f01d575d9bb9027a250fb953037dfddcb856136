Scenario: Educational resources accessible based on care contributions
    Given Jasmine has accumulated care tokens through contributions
    And the community offers educational programs and tutoring
    When she seeks additional educational support
    Then her care tokens should be convertible to educational access
    And she should be able to use care economy participation to access learning resources
    And educational opportunities should not be limited to those who can pay market rates
    And her demonstrated contribution should give her standing to access education
    And care economy should support educational equity
    And reduce barriers to educational access for contributing community members
