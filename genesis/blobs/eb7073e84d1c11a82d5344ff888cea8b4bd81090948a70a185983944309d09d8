Scenario: Recognition of invisible care labor in personal identity
    Given Sarah performs enormous amounts of invisible care work
    And traditional economics don't recognize meal planning, schedule management, emotional labor
    When Sarah reviews her care contributions
    Then the Value Scanner should make all care labor visible
    And her personal_agent should quantify meal planning, shopping, cooking, coordination, kin-keeping
    And care tokens should accumulate reflecting her actual contributions
    And Sarah's self-understanding should shift from "not working" to "performing essential care labor"
    And visibility should transform how Sarah sees herself
