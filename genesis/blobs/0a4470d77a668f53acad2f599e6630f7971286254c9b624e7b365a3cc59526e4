Scenario: Household labor distribution made visible and equitable
    Given Robert and Jennifer both work full-time
    And they share household management, parent care, and child support
    And household labor distribution can become inequitable invisibly
    When household_elohim tracks care contributions
    Then it should make all household labor visible
    And surface patterns: "Jennifer has managed 78% of parent care coordination this month"
    And prompt discussion when distribution becomes unbalanced
    And help them negotiate equitable distribution
    And recognize that both partners carry substantial care burden
    And support them in maintaining partnership equity
    And prevent resentment from invisible labor imbalances
