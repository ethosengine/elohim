Scenario: Appeal involves superintelligent agent reasoning complexity
    Given an agent decision involved reasoning approaching human comprehension limits
    And I appeal but struggle to understand what I'm appealing
    When National Constitutional Council faces superintelligence governance question
    Then they confront fundamental legitimacy challenge
    And Technical experts explain what can and cannot be understood
    And Council must decide if cryptographic constitutional proof suffices
    And They grapple with governing what exceeds their comprehension
    And They may establish limits on agent capability until explainability improves
    And My appeal forces honest reckoning with superintelligence governance
    And Democratic oversight is preserved even at frontiers of AI capability
