Scenario: Teaching and mentoring grandchildren as valued care work
    Given Margaret provides not just childcare but teaching and mentoring
    And she's passing on knowledge, values, and skills
    When the family_elohim tracks educational care contributions
    Then it should recognize teaching as distinct care category
    And it should track skill-building and mentoring activities
    And the long-term value of grandparent teaching should be recognized
    And Margaret's role in grandchildren's development should be visible
    And intergenerational knowledge transmission should be valued
    And cultural/family traditions taught by Margaret should be tracked
