Scenario: Recognizing workplace exploitation patterns
    Given my employer demands maximum flexibility with minimal compensation
    And I experience unpredictable scheduling, low wages, and poor conditions
    When the workplace_elohim analyzes my employment situation
    Then it should identify exploitation patterns
    And help me recognize when conditions violate standards or norms
    And provide information about my legal rights and protections
    And empower me to name what I am experiencing
