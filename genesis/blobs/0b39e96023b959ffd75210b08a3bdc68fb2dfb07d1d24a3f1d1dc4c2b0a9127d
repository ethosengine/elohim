Scenario: Appeal escalates to national level due to fundamental constitutional tension
    Given my case couldn't be resolved at regional level
    And it reveals fundamental tension in constitutional principles
    And regional councils have reached conflicting interpretations
    When my appeal reaches National Constitutional Council
    Then randomly-selected citizens from across the nation deliberate
    And They serve 6-month terms given the gravity of national precedent
    And They address question "does mental health intervention ever justify privacy breach at constitutional level?"
    And They create precedent affecting millions of people
    And They produce comprehensive written opinion with deep reasoning
    And The national precedent guides all lower-layer councils going forward
