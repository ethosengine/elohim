Feature: Educational Layer Value Literacy for Young Child
  As a young child in the value scanner system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to learn value literacy through direct experience
  So that I understand that care creates value and my choices matter

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the young_child user "Tommy" is registered in the system
    And Tommy is 5 years old in the Pure Discovery phase
    And the educational governance context is active
    And pedagogical principles for ages 5-7 are configured
    And the Value Scanner serves as Tommy's teacher

  Scenario: Learning value literacy through concrete experiences
    Given Tommy is at the concrete operational stage of development
    And abstract economic thinking has not yet developed
    When Tommy uses the Value Scanner to make care decisions
    Then learning should occur through direct, concrete experiences
    And the personal_agent should present choices in tangible terms
    And abstract concepts like "opportunity cost" should not be introduced
    And Tommy should learn by doing: "Strawberries for Emma"
    And value literacy should be built through action, not explanation
    And neural pathways around care-based decision making should form

  Scenario: Relationship-based learning preserves wonder
    Given Tommy needs wonder preservation during learning
    And relationship is primary for ages 5-7
    When the personal_agent teaches Tommy about care economy
    Then teaching should happen through story and relationship
    And the agent should feel like a caring guide, not a system
    And learning should be framed as adventures: "What will make Emma smile?"
    And transactional language should never be used
    And wonder at the world should be preserved, not diminished
    And the magic of caring should remain intact

  Scenario: Educational pace adapts to individual developmental readiness
    Given Tommy's development may differ from age averages
    And learning readiness varies widely at ages 5-7
    When the personal_agent teaches value concepts
    Then instruction should adapt to Tommy's actual capabilities
    And the system should observe Tommy's comprehension
    And pacing should match Tommy's readiness, not chronological age
    And no child should be pushed beyond developmental capacity
    And no child should be held back from what they're ready to learn

  Scenario: Teaching that care work is valuable begins at age 5
    Given traditional economics makes care work invisible
    And Tommy is forming foundational understanding of value
    When Tommy performs care labor in the scanner
    Then the system should explicitly teach that care creates value
    And Tommy should learn "You helped. Your care matters."
    And his care contributions should be recognized immediately
    And he should understand that caring for others is valuable work
    And foundational belief that care has worth should be established
    And this teaching should precede any exposure to market economics

  Scenario: Learning agency within appropriate boundaries
    Given Tommy needs to develop healthy sense of agency
    And he also needs safety and guidance
    When Tommy makes choices in the Value Scanner
    Then he should experience genuine decision-making power
    And he should learn that his choices have real consequences
    And he should discover natural limits through experience
    And boundaries should teach safety, not powerlessness
    And he should learn both capability and humility

  Scenario: Educational design prevents formation of consumer identity
    Given consumer capitalism targets children for identity formation
    And Tommy is highly vulnerable to conditioning
    When Tommy learns through the Value Scanner
    Then no gamification should train extraction thinking
    And no points systems should create achievement addiction
    And no rewards should condition consumption behavior
    And identity formation should center on care, not acquisition
    And Tommy should learn to see himself as contributor, not consumer

  Scenario: Teaching reciprocity and mutual care through experience
    Given Tommy is learning social and moral concepts
    And reciprocity is foundational to care economy
    When Tommy both gives and receives care through the scanner
    Then he should learn that care flows in multiple directions
    And he should experience receiving recognition for his care
    And he should practice recognizing others' care for him
    And reciprocal care patterns should be modeled
    And mutual flourishing should be taught through practice

  Scenario: Early childhood education policies inform pedagogical approach
    Given educational governance includes early childhood development research
    And evidence-based practices exist for ages 5-7
    When the personal_agent's pedagogy is configured
    Then it should incorporate developmental psychology research
    And it should follow evidence-based early learning principles
    And it should respect limits of cognitive development at age 5
    And it should support optimal development trajectories
    And educational policy should shape how Tommy is taught

  Scenario: Learning that contributes to community knowledge without exploitation
    Given Tommy's learning patterns generate educational data
    And this data could improve pedagogy for other children
    When Tommy's anonymized learning data is collected
    Then it must only be used to improve educational outcomes
    And Tommy's privacy must be absolutely protected
    And no commercial exploitation of learning data should occur
    And data should serve collective learning, not surveillance capitalism
    And Tommy's education must never be monetized

  Scenario: Foundation for lifelong value literacy begins at age 5
    Given Tommy is forming foundational beliefs about economics
    And early learning shapes lifelong patterns
    When Tommy completes the Pure Discovery phase
    Then he should have internalized that care creates value
    And he should understand that his choices matter to others
    And he should experience himself as capable care contributor
    And he should expect technology to serve human flourishing
    And he should have alternative to consumer capitalism as baseline
    And his generation should grow up assuming care economy is normal

  Scenario: Teaching includes ecological care appropriate to age
    Given care economy extends beyond human relationships
    And environmental stewardship is part of value literacy
    When Tommy learns about care through the scanner
    Then ecological care should be introduced at concrete level
    And Tommy should learn "Taking care of our food" (not abstract sustainability)
    And connections between care for people and care for environment should begin
    And age-appropriate environmental consciousness should develop
    And foundations for ecological stewardship should be laid

  Scenario: Voice guidance ensures accessibility for pre-readers
    Given Tommy is 5 and may have limited reading ability
    And accessibility is required for equitable education
    When Tommy uses the educational features of the scanner
    Then voice guidance should be available throughout
    And visual feedback should be primary
    And no reading ability should be required for core functionality
    And audio should be warm, encouraging, and developmentally appropriate
    And the system should be accessible to all children regardless of reading level
