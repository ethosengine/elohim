Scenario: Parent participates in 15 minutes not 3 hours
    Given the school board meets Tuesday at 7 PM for 3+ hours
    And the parent has work shift, dinner, and bedtime routines
    When the parent cannot attend the meeting in person
    Then they receive 3-minute morning summary of decisions
    And can submit questions and positions via mobile app
    And get alert if their child's school is specifically affected
    And review post-meeting summary with action items
    And democracy fits into parent's actual available time
