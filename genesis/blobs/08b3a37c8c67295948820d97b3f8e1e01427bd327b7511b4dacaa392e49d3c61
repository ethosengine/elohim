Scenario: Multiple appellants challenge same community decision
    Given several community members appeal the same Community Elohim decision
    And we all believe a community resource decision was unjust
    When Constitutional Council reviews the multiple related appeals
    Then they treat this as collective concern requiring community deliberation
    And They evaluate if the decision violated community consensus
    And They examine if community participation in the decision was adequate
    And They may convene community assembly to deliberate the issue
    And The appeals trigger democratic engagement not just individual recourse
    And Community governance evolves through collective voice
