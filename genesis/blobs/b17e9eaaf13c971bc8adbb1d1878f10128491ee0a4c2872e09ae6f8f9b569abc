Scenario: Food sharing and collective cooking in student community
    Given many students face food insecurity
    And collective meals reduce individual costs
    When Kenji participates in community meal sharing
    Then the community_elohim should recognize communal feeding as care work
    And it should value both cooking for others and hosting shared meals
    And it should track "Kenji cooked dinner for 8 people in study group"
    And food sharing should be core care economy practice
    And the system should make nutrition care visible and valued
    And collective eating should build community bonds
