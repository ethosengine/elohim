Scenario: Managing educational implications of children's trauma behaviors
    Given my children's trauma manifests in school behaviors (acting out, withdrawal, academic struggles)
    And school may not understand trauma-informed responses
    When children's trauma affects their school experience
    Then the Value Scanner helps me advocate for trauma-informed school responses
    And provides information on trauma's educational impacts
    And helps schools understand children's behaviors as trauma responses, not "bad" behavior
    And coordinates with school mental health support
    And tracks children's behavioral patterns and triggers
    And my personal_agent alerts me to concerning school incidents
    And recognizes trauma advocacy as sophisticated parenting labor
    And validates that trauma-informed education protects children
