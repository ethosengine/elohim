Scenario: Local events adapted for elderly participation
    Given neighborhood events are important for community connection
    And Helen's limitations affect her ability to participate
    When neighborhood events are planned
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should advocate for accessibility
    And events should include seating, accessible locations, and quiet spaces
    And transportation should be coordinated for those with mobility limits
    And Helen should be able to participate in neighborhood life
    And adaptation should enable, not separate
    And the protocol should ensure elderly inclusion in community events
    And neighborhood culture should include all ages and capabilities
