Scenario: Developer faces accountability for state policy capture
    Given a developer lobbies for state law preempting local control
    And funds astroturf "affordability advocacy" groups
    When the Observer reveals developer funding and advocacy patterns
    Then citizens see: "housing advocates" are developer-funded front groups
    And state preemption bill eliminates local affordable housing requirements
    And policy serves developer profit not affordable housing
    And manufactured grassroots campaigns face exposure
    And policy debate gains transparency about real interests
