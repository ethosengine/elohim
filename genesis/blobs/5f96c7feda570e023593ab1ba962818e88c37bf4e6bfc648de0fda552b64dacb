Scenario: Research on cultural values and constitutional universality
    Given protocol claims universal minimums while allowing cultural diversity
    And I question whether "universal" reflects Western bias
    When I study constitutional interpretation across radically different cultures
    Then I examine: how different traditions understand dignity, care, autonomy
    And I analyze: whether constitutional principles translate across worldviews
    And I explore: legitimate cultural variation vs cultural relativism about harm
    And I identify: truly universal minimums vs culturally specific instantiations
    And I assess: whether protocol enables pluralism or imposes uniformity
    And My research informs: global constitutional evolution that honors diversity
    And Findings shape: how humanity governs together while respecting difference
