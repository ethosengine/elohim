Scenario: Community resource sharing networks reduce regional consumption
    Given Maria participates in tool libraries, clothing swaps, and resource sharing
    And these networks reduce overall community consumption
    When bioregional resource flows are tracked
    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify community sharing impact
    And it should recognize Maria's participation in community resource efficiency
    And sharing networks should be valued as bioregional resilience building
    And community cooperation should be celebrated as ecological practice
    And Maria should see her participation as regional sustainability contribution
