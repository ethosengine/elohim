Scenario: Community intergenerational connection facilitated by middle-aged bridge
    Given Robert connects to multiple generations: children, peers, parents
    And he understands needs and perspectives across age ranges
    And community thrives through intergenerational connection
    When community_elohim leverages his intergenerational position
    Then it should recognize him as bridge between generations
    And support him in facilitating intergenerational community programs
    And help younger and older community members connect through him
    And value his translation between generational perspectives
    And build community cohesion through intergenerational care
    And demonstrate that middle-aged adults uniquely enable community integration
    And strengthen community through lifecycle diversity
