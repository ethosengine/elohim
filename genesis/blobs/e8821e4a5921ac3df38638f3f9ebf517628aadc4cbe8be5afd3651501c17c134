Scenario: Memory preservation as educational contribution
    Given Helen holds family and community history
    And dementia threatens loss of collective memory
    When Helen participates in memory preservation projects
    Then her storytelling should be captured for educational archives
    And oral history should be treated as legitimate historical knowledge
    And her participation should be recognized as educational contribution
    And the protocol should prioritize preservation while Helen can still share
    And cultural heritage should be maintained through elder participation
    And Helen's memory keeping should be valued as community education
    And historical knowledge should be preserved before it's lost
