Scenario: Temporary residency patterns and neighborhood turnover
    Given student neighborhoods have high turnover
    And institutional knowledge is lost with each cohort
    When the neighborhood_elohim manages turnover
    Then it should preserve neighborhood practices across student generations
    And it should help new students learn neighborhood norms quickly
    And it should maintain neighborhood continuity despite turnover
    And transient residents should still build lasting neighborhood patterns
    And the system should stabilize high-turnover neighborhoods
    And neighborhood culture should persist beyond individual residents
