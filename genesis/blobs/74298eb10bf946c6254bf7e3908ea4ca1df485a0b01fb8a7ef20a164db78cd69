**Instructions:** Metrics and Benchmarks

"If we truly believe that 'by their fruit you will recognize them' (Matthew 7:16), how might we reimagine our measures of success and growth in the church to reflect the Fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)? Consider both personal spiritual development and communal church life in your response."  
This elevated version:

Grounds the question in scripture, reminding participants of the biblical basis for this approach.  
Directly references the Fruits of the Spirit, encouraging participants to consider each one (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control).  
Challenges the notion of "metrics" by using the more holistic term "measures of success and growth."  
Encourages participants to think beyond just church attendance or giving, which are often default metrics.  
Prompts consideration of both individual and community aspects of spiritual growth.  
Implicitly questions current church practices without being confrontational.  
Invites creative thinking about how abstract spiritual concepts might be practically observed or cultivated.

This reframed question should lead to a richer discussion about what truly matters in Christian life and how we might realign our focus and practices to nurture the Fruits of the Spirit in ourselves and our communities.
