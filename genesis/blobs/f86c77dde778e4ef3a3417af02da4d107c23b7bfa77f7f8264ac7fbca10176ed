Scenario: Politician evaluates polluting facility permit with comprehensive analysis
    Given company applies for permit to operate polluting facility
    And promises economic benefits and claims minimal environmental impact
    When the Observer analyzes facility proposal and company track record
    Then they see company's violation history at other locations
    And understand health impacts on nearby residential populations
    And identify existing pollution burden in target neighborhood
    And review economic claims against actual job creation in similar facilities
    And make informed decision balancing economics with environmental protection
