# REA: The Accounting Model That Sees Value

## What is REA?

REA (Resources, Events, Agents) is an accounting framework developed by William McCarthy in 1982 that tracks **actual value flows** rather than monetary abstractions.

Traditional double-entry bookkeeping asks: "What accounts changed?"
REA asks: "What happened? Who was involved? What was transformed?"

## The Three Core Elements

### Resources
Things of economic value that can be:
- **Consumed** (used up in a process)
- **Produced** (created through work)
- **Transferred** (moved between agents)
- **Used** (applied without consumption)

Resources include: time, skills, materials, care, attention, knowledge, environmental capacity.

### Events
Economic happenings that transform resources:
- A nurse stabilizes a patient (care event)
- A repair tech fixes a laptop (production event)
- A teacher explains a concept (knowledge transfer event)
- A parent prepares a meal (care work event)

Events are **observable** and **recorded** - they happened, someone saw them.

### Agents
The economic actors who participate in events:
- **Providers**: Those who give resources
- **Receivers**: Those who receive resources
- **Witnesses**: Those who observe and validate

## Why REA Matters for Care Economies

Traditional accounting is **value-blind**:
- A dollar from exploitation equals a dollar from care
- Invisible labor isn't counted
- Environmental costs are externalized

REA accounting is **value-aware**:
- Every resource transformation is recorded
- Care work becomes visible
- All contributions can be recognized

## The REA Event Structure

```
EVENT: Emergency_Care_2024
├── Resources Consumed:
│   ├── Nurse time: 47 minutes
│   ├── Medical supplies: IV kit
│   └── Emotional labor: high intensity
├── Resources Created:
│   ├── Patient stability: restored
│   ├── Family peace: anxiety → hope
│   └── Junior nurse learning: witnessed
└── Agents:
    ├── Provider: Nurse Adaeze
    ├── Receiver: Patient
    └── Witnesses: 2 junior nurses
```

This is the foundation of economic visibility.
