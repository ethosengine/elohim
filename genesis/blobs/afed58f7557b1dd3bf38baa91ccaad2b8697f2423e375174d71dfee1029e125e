Scenario: Reciprocal care flows challenge narrative of one-directional dependence
    Given family relationships often assume disabled people only receive care
    And Alex actually provides substantial care to family
    When the family_elohim tracks care contributions
    Then Alex's care work for family should be made visible
    And Alex provides emotional support, advice, practical help to family members
    And care should be recognized as flowing in multiple directions
    And the narrative that Alex only takes should be countered with data
    And family should see Alex as care contributor, not just recipient
    And reciprocity should be made undeniable through quantification
    And cultural assumptions should be challenged by visible reality
