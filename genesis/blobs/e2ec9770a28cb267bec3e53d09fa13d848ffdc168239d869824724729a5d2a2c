Given AI governance is global challenge
And national policies affect each other
When I work with international policy makers
Then we share: legislative approaches and evidence
And we coordinate: to resist regulatory arbitrage
And we establish: democratic governance norms
And we resist: race-to-bottom dynamics
And we protect: protocol sovereignty internationally
And we support: global democratic AI development
