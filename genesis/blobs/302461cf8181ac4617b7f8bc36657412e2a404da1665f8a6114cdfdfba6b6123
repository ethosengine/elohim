Scenario: Board member verifies administrator claims about state mandates
    Given district administration claims state mandates prevent local changes
    And politicians suspect bureaucratic resistance masked as legal constraint
    When the Observer researches actual state requirements
    Then they see what's legally required versus administrative preference
    And identify how other districts handle same mandates differently
    And distinguish genuine constraints from bureaucratic inertia
    And push for changes within actual legal bounds
    And hold administration accountable for implementation choices
