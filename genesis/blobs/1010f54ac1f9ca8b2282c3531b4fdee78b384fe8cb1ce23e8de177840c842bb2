Scenario: Seeing patterns across multiple appeals inform community calibration
    Given our council has reviewed 50 appeals over two months
    And I notice recurring themes and tensions
    When I observe patterns in appeal types and outcomes
    Then I see: many adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging
    And I notice: three business loan denials with similar criteria
    And I identify: recurring privacy threshold concerns
    And I share: these observations with community leader
    And community can: consider local protocol calibration
    And my service: informs democratic governance beyond individual cases
    And patterns reveal: community-wide issues requiring deliberation
