Scenario: Parent tracks school board promises over time
    Given the school board promised to "address transportation issues by Q2"
    And the parent's child still has unreliable bus service three months later
    When the parent checks Observer's commitment tracking
    Then they see the exact promise made in the February meeting
    And view that no action has been taken despite deadline passing
    And can raise specific accountability question at next meeting
    And institutional memory persists beyond administrator turnover
    And board commitments to parents aren't forgotten when attention shifts
