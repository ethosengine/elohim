Scenario: Investor network coordinates citywide democratic business support
    Given isolated community investment pools lack coordination
    And municipal-scale transformation requires network coordination
    When investors organize citywide community investment network
    Then capital is coordinated across neighborhoods for strategic conversions
    And successful practices are shared across community investment pools
    And collective bargaining power increases with financial institutions
    And citywide democratic economy infrastructure develops through investor coordination
    And municipality_elohim facilitates citywide investor network coordination
