Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained throughout system
    Given Frank participates in the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Frank chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then his choice must be honored immediately and completely
    And all data retention must follow minimal legal requirements
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
    And Frank's right to not participate must be absolute
    And his autonomy over technology use must be respected
    And disconnection should be simple, clear, and complete
