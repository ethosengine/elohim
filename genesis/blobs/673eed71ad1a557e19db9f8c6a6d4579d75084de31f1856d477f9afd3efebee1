Scenario: Neighborhood connection across economic differences
    Given the neighborhood includes families at different income levels
    And economic inequality can divide communities
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates care economy
    Then it should enable connection across economic differences
    And care tokens should provide support to lower-income families
    And resource sharing should reduce economic barriers
    And neighborhood cooperation should reduce inequality impacts
    And mixed-income community should be strengthened
    And the system should build solidarity, not division
