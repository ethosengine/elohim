Scenario: Organizer coordinates testimony from diverse coalition members
    Given coalition spans four languages and six neighborhoods
    And members work different shifts limiting meeting availability
    When the organizer uses Observer for testimony coordination
    Then members access testimony guidelines in their languages
    And sign up for speaking slots that work with their schedules
    And share testimony drafts for peer feedback asynchronously
    And arrive at city council with coordinated powerful messages
    And coalition shows municipal government the breadth and depth of community power
