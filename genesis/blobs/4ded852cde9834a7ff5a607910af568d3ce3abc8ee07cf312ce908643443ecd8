Scenario: Comparing protocol adoption outcomes across hundreds of communities
    Given I am studying all communities in the state that adopted Elohim Protocol
    And I have comparison group of similar communities without adoption
    When I analyze outcomes data from 200+ communities over 5 years
    Then I examine: which communities adopted and which didn't (selection patterns)
    And I measure: wellbeing, trust, economic resilience, social cohesion differences
    And I use: difference-in-differences analysis to estimate causal effects
    And I control: for demographics, economics, political culture confounds
    And I identify: what predicts adoption success vs struggle
    And I provide: statistical evidence about protocol effectiveness at scale
    And I distinguish: average effects from heterogeneous effects across community types
