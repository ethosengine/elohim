Scenario: Educational institutions recognize teen care contributions
    Given Jasmine volunteers extensively while maintaining academic work
    And educational institutions value "well-rounded" students
    When her school evaluates her holistically
    Then educational_elohim should make her care contributions visible
    And provide comprehensive view of her capabilities beyond grades
    And colleges should see her substantial care economy participation
    And recognize leadership demonstrated through care work
    And value care contributions alongside academic and extracurricular achievements
    And support her access to educational opportunities based on comprehensive participation
