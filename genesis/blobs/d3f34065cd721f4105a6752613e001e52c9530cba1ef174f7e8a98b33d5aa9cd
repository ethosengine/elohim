Scenario: Manager facilitates scheduling through negotiation, not command
    Given workers need coordinated schedule balancing operational and personal needs
    And corporate model had Marcus impose schedule unilaterally
    When scheduling conflicts arise
    Then Marcus proposes schedule based on operational requirements
    And Marcus facilitates negotiation between workers with competing needs
    And workers modify proposal based on their life circumstances
    And workers democratically approve final schedule
    And Marcus cannot override worker decision
    And workplace_elohim ensures process remains democratic
