Scenario: Community coordination reduces individual family burden
    Given Marcus carries heavy household responsibility
    And community coordination could reduce this burden
    When the community_elohim identifies systemic solutions
    Then it should propose community-level responses to individual struggles
    And collective action should be suggested: cooperatives, sharing networks, bulk buying
    And Marcus's individual burden should decrease through community organization
    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy reduces isolation
    And community should exist to coordinate care across families
    And systemic support should replace individual heroics where possible
