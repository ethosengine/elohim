Scenario: Community policy advocacy informed by care economy data
    Given Sarah advocates for community policy changes
    And data about care work supports policy arguments
    When Sarah engages in advocacy
    Then the community_elohim should provide aggregated care economy data
    And Sarah should show that care work is substantial and invisible
    And policy discussions should be informed by actual care patterns
    And advocacy should be strengthened by quantified evidence
    And care economy data should transform policy debates
