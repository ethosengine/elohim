Scenario: Young child makes autonomous care decision within boundaries
    Given Tommy is selecting fruit for his sister Emma
    And Emma has nut allergies configured in the system
    And the family budget constraints are active
    When Tommy scans strawberries for Emma
    Then his personal_agent should recognize the care intention
    And the agent should say "Remember, Emma loves the red ones"
    And the choice should be recorded as a care contribution
    And Tommy should experience genuine autonomy
    And invisible guardrails should prevent allergen selection
    And Tommy should not be aware of the protective boundaries
