Scenario: Activist identifies state preemption blocking local solutions
    Given the activist's community wants rent control
    But local municipality cannot enact it
    When the Observer explains state preemption law
    Then the activist learns state policy blocks local authority
    And sees which legislators voted for preemption
    And identifies campaign donors (real estate lobby)
    And connects to statewide coalition fighting preemption
    And local organizing scales to state-level campaign
