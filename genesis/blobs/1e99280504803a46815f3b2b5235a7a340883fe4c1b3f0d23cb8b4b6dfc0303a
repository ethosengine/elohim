Scenario: Navigating family history of medical trauma
    Given Alex may have experienced medical trauma in childhood
    And family might have painful history around Alex's disability
    When family discusses disability-related topics
    Then the family_elohim should recognize potential trauma triggers
    And it should support Alex in managing difficult family dynamics
    And Alex should have tools to redirect unhelpful conversations
    And family should be prompted toward disability justice frameworks
    And the protocol should help family shift from medical to social model
    And Alex should be supported in processing family history
    And healing should be possible through better frameworks
