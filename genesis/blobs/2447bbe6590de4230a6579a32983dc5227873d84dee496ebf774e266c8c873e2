Scenario: Citizen accesses community resources without attending meetings
    Given the citizen works evening shifts
    And cannot attend 7 PM community meetings in person
    When community decisions are being made
    Then they can review asynchronous meeting summaries
    And submit positions via the app during lunch break
    And join key decision moments virtually
    And participate meaningfully in 15 minutes vs 3 hours
    And working-class participation barriers are reduced
