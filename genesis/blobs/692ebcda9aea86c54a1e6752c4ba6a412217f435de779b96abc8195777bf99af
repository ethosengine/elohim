Scenario: Influencing municipal policy on senior services and care economy
    Given Margaret has lived experience of retirement and care economy
    And municipal policy affects senior quality of life
    When the municipality_elohim facilitates policy engagement
    Then Margaret should be connected to policy-making processes
    And her voice should inform municipal senior services
    And care economy principles should be brought to municipal governance
    And seniors should organize to shape policy
    And Margaret's contributions should give her authority in policy discussions
    And municipal planning should reflect senior input
