Scenario: Identifying technical error that strengthens appellant's case
    Given I audit agent reasoning for appeal
    And I discover genuine technical mistake (like Wisconsin address confusion)
    When I report the error to Constitutional Council
    Then I explain: clearly what went wrong
    And I assess: impact on the decision
    And I recommend: whether decision should be overturned
    And I serve: truth-telling over defending agents
    And I strengthen: appellant's case when agent erred
    And I demonstrate: that technical oversight is genuine
    And my independence: makes expertise credible
