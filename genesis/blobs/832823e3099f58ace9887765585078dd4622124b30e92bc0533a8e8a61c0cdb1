Scenario: Care contributions qualify family for community resources
    Given Marcus performs substantial household labor
    And his care contributions are tracked and valued
    When community resource allocation is determined
    Then Marcus's demonstrated stewardship should qualify his family
    And his care tokens should provide access to community support programs
    And access should be based on care contributions, not means testing
    And the framework should be reciprocity: he gives care, community gives care
    And his household labor should be recognized as community contribution
    And resource access should preserve dignity through reciprocity
