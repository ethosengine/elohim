Scenario: Community challenges single-parent stigma through visibility
    Given society often views single-parent families as deficient or problematic
    And this stigma harms Maria and her children
    When community care economy makes single parents' work visible
    Then it should demonstrate that solo parents provide extraordinary care value
    And it should challenge deficit narratives about single-parent families
    And it should reframe single parents as care economy heroes deserving support
    And community should actively combat stigma through recognition and respect
    And Maria should experience community validation, not judgment
