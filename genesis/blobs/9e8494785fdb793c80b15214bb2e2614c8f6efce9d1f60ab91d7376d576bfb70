Scenario: Neighborhood bulk buying coordinated with teen participation
    Given Jasmine's neighborhood organizes collective bulk food purchases
    And she has transportation and time flexibility
    When she participates in bulk buying coordination
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate logistics
    And track her contributions of labor (pickup, distribution, coordination)
    And enable cost savings to be distributed equitably
    And recognize that her participation makes bulk buying possible for others
    And demonstrate that care economy creates real economic value
    And show that youth participation strengthens neighborhood economic resilience
