Scenario: Connecting to neighborhood resources appropriate for students
    Given Kenji has limited budget and might face emergencies
    And neighborhoods often have resources (food banks, tool libraries, mutual aid)
    When the neighborhood_elohim connects Kenji to resources
    Then it should inform him of neighborhood food bank access
    And it should show shared resources: "Neighborhood tool library 3 blocks away"
    And it should reduce barriers to accessing community support
    And it should normalize resource sharing as care economy
    And the system should connect students to neighborhood safety nets
    And resource access should be dignified and easy
