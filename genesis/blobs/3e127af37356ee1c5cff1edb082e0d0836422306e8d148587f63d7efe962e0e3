Scenario: Accessing appeals process without technical expertise
    Given I am not tech-savvy and don't understand AI systems well
    And an agent decision has affected me in a way I disagree with
    When I want to file an appeal
    Then I can trigger the appeal with a simple button: "I disagree with this decision"
    And I can state my complaint in plain language without legal jargon
    And I don't need a lawyer or technical knowledge to participate
    And The interface guides me through the process step-by-step
    And Support is available in my language and accessible format
    And The process respects my dignity regardless of my technical literacy
