Scenario: Participating in neighborhood mutual aid and care economy
    Given my neighborhood has informal mutual aid networks
    And I can contribute even while receiving support
    When I engage with neighborhood care economy
    Then the Value Scanner connects me to local mutual aid networks
    And makes visible my contributions (childcare exchanges, skill sharing, information sharing)
    And facilitates reciprocal care relationships in neighborhood
    And tracks my care economy participation with care tokens
    And validates that I have valuable contributions despite crisis
    And my personal_agent identifies opportunities to contribute
    And recognizes mutual aid participation as community-building work
    And supports reciprocal relationships, not one-way charity
