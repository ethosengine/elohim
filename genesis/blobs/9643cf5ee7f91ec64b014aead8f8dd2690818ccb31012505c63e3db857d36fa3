Scenario: Workplace privacy protects care economy data from employer access
    Given Sarah participates in care economy
    And this generates data about her personal life
    When workplace wants information about employees
    Then Sarah's personal care economy data must be completely private
    And employers should never access household care patterns
    And the workplace_elohim should only see work-relevant information
    And Sarah's privacy should be absolute in personal care matters
    And workplace participation should not require personal data sacrifice
