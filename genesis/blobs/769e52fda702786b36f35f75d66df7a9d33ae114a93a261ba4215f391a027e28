Scenario: Refugee connects with cultural community in diaspora
    Given Amira wants to maintain Syrian cultural connections
    When she joins the Syrian diaspora cultural community
    And the community includes refugees across multiple countries
    Then she finds others who share her language and culture
    And cultural practices, recipes, and traditions are preserved
    And she participates in Arabic language maintenance
    And her children can learn their cultural heritage
    And the community provides mutual support across diaspora
