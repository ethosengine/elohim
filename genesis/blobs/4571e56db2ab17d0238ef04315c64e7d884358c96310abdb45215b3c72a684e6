Scenario: Local material sourcing reduces transportation impact
    Given Frank's construction work requires materials
    And material transportation has significant carbon footprint
    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates material sourcing
    Then it should facilitate use of locally-sourced materials
    And connect Frank to local salvage and reclaimed material sources
    And reduce transportation impact through bioregional supply chains
    And recognize local sourcing as ecological care contribution
    And strengthen bioregional material economies
    And Frank's work should demonstrate local material viability
