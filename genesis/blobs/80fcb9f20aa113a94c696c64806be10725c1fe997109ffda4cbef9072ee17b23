Scenario: Responsible developer benefits from climate adaptation standards
    Given a developer invests in climate-resilient building practices
    And exceeds flood protection and heat mitigation requirements
    When the Observer documents climate adaptation performance
    Then the developer shows: flood resilience investment prevented $2M damages
    And urban heat island mitigation reduced cooling costs 30%
    And climate adaptation creates long-term property value
    And responsible practices gain competitive advantage as climate risks increase
    And genuine adaptation distinguishes from minimal compliance
