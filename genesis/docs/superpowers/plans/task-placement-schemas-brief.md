Item S1-S5 (gap `#10`). Build what the interfaces spec's §2.G (and §2.D/§2.E for intents and the parameter set) name for this lane, true to the spec's
signatures; where the code proves a signature wrong, fix the code to the spec's intent and record the
revision in your report so the spec can absorb it. Write-set for this lane: `elohim/sdk/schemas/v1/**`.

Write items S1-S5: `objects/tree-view` (S1), the needs block's `$defs` in the app manifest with no declarable field until its reader lands (S2, decision 15), the placement intents (S3), the parameter set (S4), and S5: `pnpm run schema:test`, codegen freshness and every existing manifest still validating. Follow `elohim/sdk/schemas/CLAUDE.md` and `views/CONVENTIONS.md`.

Rulings in force: the design spec's rulings 1-7 and §7; the orchestrator's R1-R6 and R6a (listed in
`task-placement-interfaces-brief.md`); the interfaces spec §5 resolutions; and the operator's answers of
2026-10-20: the three crate moves are approved (placement-core crate, eprfs-core admits seam-contracts,
elohim-storage may depend on eprfs-core and eprfs-serve); incumbency is scoped to the parameter set in force
and the built-in default set is exempt from ratification; the app declares closure, loss and signing as
needs and the space resolves them; the write-set covers interface code and the first adapters.
Architecture before landing: no staging, commits or pushes. Claim the cargo berth before any cargo run
(`berth claim cargo --class verify --ttl 3600`), release it after, echo `EXIT=$?` on its own line after every
run, and never judge a cargo run from piped output. Never cd into a submodule or worktree. Pin
`RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=1.96.1` for manual cargo; prefer `just gate <project>`. Running behavior must not change
except where this item's interfaces spec section says an adapter replaces a mechanism, and then only behind
the same tests passing.

Report: `task-placement-schemas-report.md` in this directory with `gap:`, `actor:` and `status:`, listing files
changed, tests added, gate commands with their `EXIT`, and every place the code and the interfaces spec
disagreed.
