Feature: International Solidarity and Global Coordination for Activist
  As an activist in the social_medium system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want to coordinate across borders and build international movements
  So that humanity can address planetary-scale challenges through solidarity

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the global governance context is active
    And activists operate across multiple nation-states and cultures

  Scenario: Activist builds cross-border solidarity network
    Given labor activists in 15 countries face similar corporate exploitation
    And they want to coordinate against multinational corporation practices
    When they form a global labor solidarity network
    And they establish protocols respecting different legal contexts
    And translation agents enable communication across 12 languages
    Then the global network creates shared understanding of corporate tactics
    And each national group maintains autonomy over local strategy
    And pattern recognition surfaces successful resistance campaigns
    And coordination happens through verified trust relationships
    And legal risks are minimized through jurisdictional awareness

  Scenario: Activist shares evidence across borders under repression
    Given an activist documents human rights violations in their country
    And sharing this evidence locally would endanger them and their community
    When they contribute documentation to international human rights network
    And the evidence is verified through multiple independent sources
    Then the evidence reaches international solidarity organizations
    And it bypasses national censorship through distributed architecture
    And the activist's identity is protected through cryptographic anonymity
    And international pressure can be mobilized while protecting sources
    And the network coordinates advocacy at UN and regional bodies
    And documentation is preserved for future accountability processes

  Scenario: Activist coordinates planetary climate strike
    Given youth activists worldwide demand emergency climate action
    And they want coordinated strikes across all continents
    When the network establishes a coordinated action date
    And local groups plan context-appropriate actions
    And the coordination respects different hemispheres, cultures, and capacities
    Then each community organizes autonomously within global framework
    And the translation agents enable real-time cross-language coordination
    And traditional media amplification is earned through demonstrated scale
    And the collective action maintains coherence without centralized control
    And impact is measured through network-wide participation tracking
    And the strike demonstrates viable model for global coordination

  Scenario: Activist prevents extraction by powerful institutions
    Given major foundations want to "support" the climate movement
    And they offer funding that would create dependency and moderate demands
    When the network evaluates the funding opportunity
    Then historical patterns of movement capture surface for consideration
    And communities who worked with these funders share experiences
    And the network collectively evaluates risks and benefits
    And alternative solidarity economy models are proposed
    And the movement maintains independence while building sustainable support
    And extractive relationships are refused through collective accountability
