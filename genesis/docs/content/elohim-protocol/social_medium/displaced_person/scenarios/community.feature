Feature: Community Connection Across Displacement
  As a displaced_person in the social_medium system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to maintain connections to my origin community while building new ones
  So that I can preserve relationships and identity while establishing new life

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the displaced_person user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active
    And the displaced person is Maria, who fled domestic violence to a new city

  Scenario: Displaced person maintains safe connection with home community
    Given Maria left her hometown to escape an abusive partner
    And she wants to stay connected with friends and family back home
    When Maria configures her privacy settings for selective visibility
    And she marks her abuser and his associates as blocked
    Then she can communicate with trusted home community members
    And her new location is never revealed to blocked individuals
    And her abuser cannot find or contact her through the system
    And she maintains important relationships while staying safe

  Scenario: Displaced person builds connection in new community
    Given Maria has relocated to a new city where she knows no one
    When she joins her new neighborhood community space
    And she participates in local mutual aid and support networks
    Then she can gradually build trust in her new community
    And neighbors help her find resources and employment
    And she establishes new relationships while processing loss
    And the new community welcomes her without requiring full disclosure

  Scenario: Displaced person receives support from domestic violence network
    Given Maria is recovering from domestic violence trauma
    When she joins a domestic violence survivor support affinity network
    And the network provides peer support and resources
    Then she connects with others who understand her experience
    And she receives practical support for rebuilding her life
    And the network helps her access legal aid and counseling
    And she finds strength and healing through community support
    And her safety is maintained through privacy protections

  Scenario: Displaced person's abuser attempts to locate her
    Given Maria's abuser is trying to find her new location
    When he attempts to contact her through the Elohim network
    And he tries to contact her friends to get information
    Then all his messages are blocked before reaching Maria
    And her friends' connections don't leak location information
    And the protection agent alerts relevant support networks
    And Maria's sanctuary protocol remains secure
    And she is protected without constant fear and vigilance
