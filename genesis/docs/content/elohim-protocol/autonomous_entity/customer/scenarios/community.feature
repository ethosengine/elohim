Feature: Community Institution Participation and Wealth Circulation for Customer
  As a customer in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to participate in democratic community institutions
  So that consumption builds neighborhood wealth and solidarity

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Ms. Johnson is part of neighborhood served by democratic businesses
    And the community governance context is active
    And customer participation shapes community economic development

  Scenario: Customer spending circulates wealth in neighborhood economy
    Given Ms. Johnson spends $900 annually at democratic ChickenMax/Maria's Kitchen
    And multiply her spending by hundreds of neighborhood customers
    When democratic ownership ensures value circulates locally instead of extracting
    Then $540 of her spending goes to workers who spend in neighborhood
    And $270 supports community programs benefiting neighbors
    And $90 funds environmental stewardship protecting local health
    And aggregate customer spending ($200K+ annually from regulars) massively benefits community
    And community_elohim documents wealth circulation vs. previous corporate extraction

  Scenario: Customer participates in community stakeholder governance processes
    Given democratic businesses can include community members in governance
    And Ms. Johnson has community knowledge and cares about neighborhood
    When stakeholder participation is offered to engaged customers
    Then she attends quarterly stakeholder meetings providing input
    And suggests senior meal program addressing neighborhood isolation
    And votes on community program priorities (advisory role)
    And participation connects her individual needs to collective governance
    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation ensuring worker autonomy

  Scenario: Customer consumption choice influences neighborhood economic development
    Given community economic development typically means corporate recruitment with subsidies
    And Ms. Johnson's consumption patterns seemed economically insignificant
    When democratic businesses demonstrate customer support builds alternative economy
    Then her choice to support democratic business over corporate chain matters politically
    And aggregate customer choices determine which business models thrive
    And consumption becomes vote for economic democracy vs. extraction
    And neighborhood economy transforms through collective customer choices
    And community_elohim helps customers understand collective impact of consumption

  Scenario: Customer advocacy spreads democratic business model through community
    Given Ms. Johnson experiences benefits of democratic business personally
    And neighbors don't know democratic alternatives exist
    When satisfied customers share experiences and advocate for democratic businesses
    Then she tells neighbors about worker ownership and improved quality
    And brings isolated elders to senior meal program
    And word-of-mouth advocacy builds customer base for democratic businesses
    And community awareness of economic democracy grows through customer stories
    And community_elohim supports customer advocacy and community education

  Scenario: Customer connects to community through democratic business gathering spaces
    Given neighborhood lacks accessible community gathering spaces
    And Ms. Johnson experiences isolation common to many residents
    When democratic businesses serve as community hubs beyond commercial function
    Then she attends community events at Maria's Kitchen (harvest dinners, neighborhood meetings)
    And meets neighbors at senior meal program building social networks
    And participates in community organizing using business space after hours
    And democratic business becomes social infrastructure combating isolation
    And community_elohim coordinates community programming at democratic business spaces

  Scenario: Customer learns about supply chain connecting to bioregional food system
    Given corporate food is anonymous commodity obscuring agricultural connections
    And Ms. Johnson never thought about where her food came from
    When democratic transparency reveals supply chain relationships
    Then she learns about Johnson Farm and Tom's regenerative agriculture
    And understands her consumption supports farmworkers earning living wages
    And sees how democratic food system operates bioregionally
    And consumption connects her to land, ecology, and agricultural labor
    And community_elohim provides educational supply chain storytelling

  Scenario: Customer benefits from community programs funded by democratic value distribution
    Given corporate extraction left minimal resources for community benefit
    And neighborhood needed senior support, youth employment, community space
    When democratic businesses allocate 30% of revenue to community programs
    Then Ms. Johnson accesses subsidized senior meals (sliding scale pricing)
    And neighbors' youth gain employment with dignity and ownership pathway
    And community space is available for organizing and mutual aid
    And her patronage funds programs benefiting entire neighborhood
    And community_elohim manages community benefit distribution ensuring equity

  Scenario: Customer becomes community investor supporting democratic conversions
    Given Ms. Johnson has modest savings wanting to support community values-aligned
    And community investment opportunities in democratic businesses exist
    When she learns neighbors invested in Maria's Kitchen conversion
    Then she considers investing in next democratic conversion (Rosa's Auto Repair)
    And investment would provide fair return (5% annually) plus social benefit
    And her capital would enable worker ownership and community wealth
    And customer role can expand to investor role if desired
    And community_elohim manages community investment accessible to customers

  Scenario: Customer experiences neighborhood economic resilience through democratic network
    Given corporate businesses close arbitrarily based on distant profit calculations
    And neighborhood institutions disappeared despite community need
    When democratic businesses are accountable to community not distant shareholders
    Then businesses remain open serving community even during economic downturns
    And worker ownership ensures commitment to neighborhood survival
    And democratic network provides mutual aid during crises
    And community economic resilience increases through democratic ownership
    And community_elohim coordinates network resilience strategies

  Scenario: Customer participates in community food sovereignty initiatives
    Given corporate food system homogenizes diets and ignores cultural preferences
    And Ms. Johnson's community is diverse with varied cultural food traditions
    When democratic businesses respond to community cultural food needs
    Then menu includes diverse cultural options (Latino, Asian, African-American cuisines)
    And Johnson Farm grows culturally-specific produce based on community requests
    And food sovereignty increases through democratic responsiveness
    And cultural food preservation becomes community priority
    And community_elohim facilitates cultural food sovereignty programming

  Scenario: Customer sees democratic business success encourage other neighborhood conversions
    Given Ms. Johnson observed Maria's Kitchen conversion and success
    And neighbors watch to see if democratic model works
    When democratic business thrives serving community well
    Then other small business owners (Rosa's Auto, neighborhood retail) consider conversion
    And successful demonstration effect inspires broader democratic economy
    And customer support proves democratic businesses are economically viable
    And neighborhood economic transformation accelerates through cascading conversions
    And community_elohim documents success stories encouraging further conversions

  Scenario: Customer participates in neighborhood celebration of democratic achievements
    Given economic development typically celebrates corporate recruitment
    And democratic conversions deserve community recognition
    When neighborhood celebrates democratic business milestones
    Then Ms. Johnson attends public celebrations of worker ownership conversions
    And community honors workers' ownership and business founders' choices
    And celebrations build collective pride and solidarity
    And democratic culture strengthens through community recognition
    And community_elohim coordinates celebration events amplifying democratic achievements
