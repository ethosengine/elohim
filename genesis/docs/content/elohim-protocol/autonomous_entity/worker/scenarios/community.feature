Feature: Community Stakeholder Relationships for Worker
  As a worker in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want meaningful relationships with our community stakeholders
  So that we serve community needs while protecting worker autonomy

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And ChickenMax #247 operates as community institution, not just business
    And the community governance context is active
    And community members invested in the EAE acquisition

  Scenario: Workers implement community meal program responding to local need
    Given Ms. Johnson mentions isolated seniors need meal program
    And community stakeholder meeting includes customer input
    When workers deliberate on community meal program proposal
    Then workers investigate partnership with senior center
    And workers analyze costs and benefits of subsidized meals
    And workers democratically vote to implement senior meal program
    And workers allocate funding from eliminated franchise fee savings
    And community_elohim facilitates connection with senior center
    And 340 community meals are served in first quarter

  Scenario: Workers welcome community stakeholder input while maintaining decision autonomy
    Given community investors funded the EAE acquisition
    And investors want input on community benefit priorities
    When annual community stakeholder meeting occurs
    Then investors and customers share priorities and concerns
    And workers listen to community input respectfully
    And workers deliberate on community suggestions democratically
    And workers maintain final decision authority on operations
    And community_elohim ensures investors cannot override worker governance
    And balanced stakeholder participation serves everyone

  Scenario: Workers build relationship with community through transparent sourcing
    Given workers source produce from Johnson Farm
    And community values local food systems and sustainability
    When workers communicate sourcing practices publicly
    Then customers learn their food comes from regenerative local farm
    And community_elohim creates farm-to-table transparency dashboard
    And customers appreciate supporting local farmer and farm workers
    And workers invite community to visit Johnson Farm during harvest
    And community connection deepens through transparent supply chains

  Scenario: Workers address problematic customer behavior democratically
    Given a customer has harassed DeShawn multiple times
    And worker safety is constitutionally protected
    When workers document harassment incidents through witness infrastructure
    Then workers review harassment pattern democratically
    And workers vote to ban the customer from ChickenMax
    And community_elohim ensures decision is fair and documented
    And community respects worker dignity protections
    And customer harassment ceases without manager intervention

  Scenario: Workers adapt operations to serve community cultural needs
    Given neighborhood has significant Latino population
    And community expresses interest in traditional menu items
    When workers receive customer feedback through community_elohim
    Then workers investigate culturally appropriate menu additions
    And workers consult community members on authentic recipes
    And workers democratically vote to expand menu with Latino dishes
    And workers hire bilingual staff to serve community better
    And business becomes more deeply embedded in community culture

  Scenario: Workers participate in neighborhood economic development planning
    Given municipality is developing economic revitalization plan
    And workers represent community institution through democratic ownership
    When neighborhood planning meetings occur
    Then Maria attends as ChickenMax worker-owner representative
    And Maria shares experience of democratic business model
    And Maria advocates for policies supporting worker ownership
    And community recognizes workers as stakeholders, not just employees
    And worker voice shapes community economic development

  Scenario: Workers collaborate with community organizations for mutual benefit
    Given local youth program needs employment opportunities
    And ChickenMax needs additional staff during busy periods
    When workers discuss partnership with youth program
    Then workers create paid internship program for neighborhood youth
    And workers provide mentorship and skill development
    And workers hire successful interns as permanent staff
    And community_elohim tracks youth development outcomes
    And community wealth circulates through youth employment

  Scenario: Workers share facility space for community organizing after hours
    Given ChickenMax dining space sits empty evenings and weekends
    And community groups need meeting space
    When community requests use of space for organizing meetings
    Then workers democratically decide to share space with community groups
    And workers establish guidelines for community space use
    And workers charge minimal fee to cover utilities
    And community groups organize tenants' rights, immigrant support, etc.
    And business becomes community hub beyond meal service

  Scenario: Workers demonstrate transparency building community trust
    Given community members want to understand democratic business model
    And workers value transparency about operations and values
    When workers publish quarterly community impact report
    Then report shows wages paid to workers ($72K quarterly)
    And report documents community programs funded ($3K senior meals)
    And report shares environmental benefits (1,200 lbs local produce)
    And report includes challenges and learnings honestly
    And community_elohim makes report accessible and understandable
    And transparency builds community trust and support

  Scenario: Workers balance community benefit with business sustainability
    Given community requests subsidized meals for more low-income residents
    And workers want to serve community while maintaining living wages
    When workers analyze financial capacity for expanded subsidies
    Then workers transparently share financial constraints with community
    And workers propose sliding scale pricing for community meals
    And community investors offer additional funding for subsidy program
    And workers democratically approve expanded program with community support
    And workplace_elohim ensures business sustainability is maintained

  Scenario: Workers respond to community crisis with mutual aid
    Given neighborhood experiences crisis (fire, flood, or emergency)
    And community members need food and gathering space
    When workers learn of community crisis
    Then workers immediately open ChickenMax for community support
    And workers provide free meals to affected community members
    And workers coordinate with community_elohim for broader support network
    And workers demonstrate solidarity through material aid
    And community reciprocates support when workers need it

  Scenario: Workers become recognized community leaders through democratic participation
    Given Maria has been worker-owner for two years
    And she participates actively in community institutions
    When community organizations seek board members
    Then Maria is invited to serve on neighborhood council
    And Maria represents both ChickenMax and broader worker interests
    And Maria's democratic governance experience transfers to civic participation
    And workers transform from exploited employees to community leaders
    And democratic workplace becomes training ground for civic democracy
