Feature: Community Wealth Building Through Democratic Investment
  As a community_investor in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to build community wealth through values-aligned investment
  So that capital supports democratic ownership and neighborhood flourishing

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Patricia lives in neighborhood with emerging democratic economy
    And the community governance context is active
    And community investment pools enable local democratic ownership

  Scenario: Investor redirects capital from extractive corporations to democratic community businesses
    Given Patricia has $60K in index funds funding corporate extraction
    And she morally opposes enterprises her capital funds but lacked alternatives
    When community investment pool offers values-aligned local alternative
    Then she moves $10K from stock market to community investment in Maria's Kitchen conversion
    And capital directly funds worker ownership, not corporate extraction
    And investment aligns with values: worker dignity, community wealth, environmental stewardship
    And financial returns are fair (5% annually) while social returns are massive
    And community_elohim facilitates investment pool management and transparent reporting

  Scenario: Investor receives transparent impact reports showing measurable community benefits
    Given stock market investing provides opaque financial returns with invisible social impacts
    And Patricia couldn't verify her portfolio's real effects
    When community investment provides radical transparency
    Then quarterly reports show: 12 workers received ownership and wage increases ($11→$18/hour)
    And 340 community meals served to isolated seniors
    And 1,200 lbs regenerative produce sourced from Johnson Farm
    And $40K circulating locally vs. extracting to distant shareholders
    And community_elohim provides detailed, verifiable impact documentation

  Scenario: Investor builds direct relationships with workers her capital supports
    Given stock market investment is anonymous and extractive
    And Patricia never met workers her capital exploited
    When community investment creates relationship opportunities
    Then she knows Maria, DeShawn, Emma—workers her investment helped liberate
    And attends stakeholder meetings learning about challenges and successes
    And workers appreciate her support without surrendering governance autonomy
    And relationship is asymmetric but not extractive (she has capital, they create value, both benefit fairly)
    And community_elohim facilitates investor-worker relationships protecting democratic governance

  Scenario: Investor participates in community investment pool governance
    Given traditional investing gives shareholders plutocratic pseudo-democracy
    And Patricia wants genuine participation, not capital-weighted control
    When community investment pool has democratic governance structure
    Then she participates in pool governance as one voice among equals
    And investment decisions consider community benefit alongside financial returns
    And pool priorities are set democratically by investors, workers, and community representatives
    And governance prevents capital from dominating democratic enterprises
    And community_elohim manages investment pool democratic governance

  Scenario: Investor earns fair financial returns without requiring extraction
    Given stock market averages ~7% annual returns through maximizing extraction
    And Patricia accepted lower returns (5%) for values alignment
    When democratic business proves financially sustainable
    Then 5% returns are paid reliably from business revenue
    And returns come from democratic value circulation, not worker exploitation
    And financial viability proves extraction isn't necessary for investor returns
    And she earns modestly while workers earn living wages and community benefits
    And community_elohim ensures transparent return calculations and timely payments

  Scenario: Investor diversifies across multiple democratic enterprises reducing risk
    Given individual business investment is high-risk
    And Patricia needs diversification for financial security
    When community investment pool spreads capital across multiple conversions
    Then her $10K in pool supports Maria's Kitchen, Rosa's Auto, and neighborhood retail
    And portfolio diversification reduces single-business failure risk
    And democratic network mutual support further reduces risk
    And risk management is transparent and community-governed
    And community_elohim coordinates portfolio diversification and risk management

  Scenario: Investor sees capital enable dignified transitions for small business owners
    Given traditional buyers would exploit workers or destroy community institutions
    And small business owners like Rosa faced impossible exit choices
    When Patricia's investment enables exit-to-community conversions
    Then Rosa achieves financial security ($180K) while protecting workers
    And legacy is preserved as democratic community institution
    And investor capital makes dignified transition possible
    And community institutions are preserved through patient investment
    And community_elohim facilitates transition financing and stakeholder support

  Scenario: Investor discovers community connection through investment network
    Given stock market investing is isolating
    And Patricia managed portfolio individually without community
    When community investment creates investor network
    Then she knows other neighborhood residents who invested in democratic conversions
    And investors share motivations, coordinate for larger projects, build community wealth strategy
    And investment becomes collective political project, not individual portfolio management
    And community connections deepen through shared values and collaboration
    And community_elohim facilitates investor network development and coordination

  Scenario: Investor consumption and investment align supporting same democratic businesses
    Given Patricia's consumption and investment were previously disconnected activities
    And roles as customer and investor didn't integrate
    When she invests in and patronizes same democratic businesses
    Then consumption supports investment supports values supports community
    And economic activities align creating virtuous cycle
    And integrated participation deepens commitment and impact
    And community economic participation becomes holistic, not fragmented
    And community_elohim helps investors see connections between consumption and investment

  Scenario: Investor capital enables community programs addressing neighborhood needs
    Given traditional investment extracts value from communities
    And Patricia wanted investment supporting community benefit, not extraction
    When democratic business allocates revenue to community programs
    Then her investment enables senior meal programs, youth employment, community space
    And investment returns include social dividends: stronger community, less isolation, economic opportunity
    And capital builds community infrastructure, not just individual wealth
    And social returns are documented and valued alongside financial returns
    And community_elohim manages community program funding from democratic business revenue

  Scenario: Investor advocacy spreads community investment model to neighbors
    Given most community members don't know democratic investment options exist
    And Patricia's neighbors invest in stock market by default
    When she shares community investment experience
    Then neighbors learn about values-aligned local investment opportunities
    And some redirect capital from stock market to community investment pool
    And investment pool grows enabling more democratic conversions
    And movement builds through investor advocacy and demonstration
    And community_elohim supports investor education and community outreach

  Scenario: Investor exit flexibility protects financial security while supporting patient capital
    Given Patricia may need liquidity for emergencies or life changes
    And democratic enterprises benefit from patient capital stability
    When investment structure balances investor needs with enterprise stability
    Then she can exit investment with 90-day notice if needed
    And encouraged to commit 3-5 years for business planning stability
    And exit terms are clear and fair protecting both investor and business
    And flexibility reduces investment barrier while supporting democratic enterprise needs
    And community_elohim manages exit processes fairly and transparently
