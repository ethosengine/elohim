Feature: National-Level Technical Expertise for Constitutional Governance
  As a technical_expert in the governance system
  Operating at the nation_state governance layer
  I want to advise on national constitutional questions involving technical complexity
  So that democratic governance of AI is informed by technical reality

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the technical_expert user is registered in the system
    And the nation_state governance context is active
    And Dr. Amara Okonkwo advises National Constitutional Council

  Scenario: Advising National Council on fundamental constitutional tension
    Given National Council deliberates care vs privacy at constitutional level
    And technical capabilities shape what's constitutionally possible
    When I testify about technical constraints and possibilities
    Then I explain: what surveillance capabilities would enable better care
    And I clarify: technical limits on achieving privacy while providing protection
    And I present: tradeoff between optimization and dignity
    And I stop: before dictating which values should prevail
    And I inform: constitutional interpretation with technical reality
    And I respect: that council must choose values not just optimize outcomes
    And I demonstrate: expertise serving democratic judgment

  Scenario: Explaining cryptographic impossibility of backdoor mandates
    Given policy makers consider requiring backdoors for law enforcement
    And this would break constitutional verification
    When I testify to National Council about technical implications
    Then I explain: backdoors make cryptographic alignment proof impossible
    And I clarify: cannot have both backdoors and constitutional verification
    And I demonstrate: this is mathematical fact not implementation choice
    And I present: security vulnerabilities backdoors create
    And I acknowledge: this constrains what governance can mandate
    And I provide: evidence policy makers need for informed choice
    And I maintain: that I'm explaining constraints not dictating values

  Scenario: Assessing whether national protocol standard violates constitution
    Given appellant challenges nationwide implementation standard
    And National Council must evaluate technical conformance
    When I audit national protocol against constitutional principles
    Then I examine: whether implementation drifted from constitutional alignment
    And I verify: cryptographic proofs across national deployment
    And I identify: systematic technical issues affecting millions
    And I assess: whether correction is feasible
    And I provide: honest evaluation even if unflattering to protocol
    And I serve: truth-telling and constitutional accountability
    And my independence: enables genuine oversight

  Scenario: Advising on national security vs constitutional rights tension
    Given appeal involves claimed national security justification
    And technical assessment is needed of security claims
    When I evaluate security-rights tradeoff technically
    Then I assess: whether claimed vulnerability is technically legitimate
    And I explore: whether less rights-violating technical alternatives exist
    And I examine: whether proposed security measure would actually work
    And I clarify: technical reality vs security theater
    And I avoid: dismissing security needs or exaggerating threats
    And I provide: honest technical assessment
    And I let: council judge values tradeoff given technical facts

  Scenario: Participating in national technical standards development
    Given national protocol standards need technical specification
    And I serve on standards development committee
    When I help craft technical requirements
    Then I ensure: standards serve constitutional principles
    And I verify: specifications are implementable
    And I check: for security vulnerabilities in standards
    And I collaborate: with diverse technical experts
    And I submit: standards to National Constitutional Council for approval
    And I demonstrate: technical development serving democratic governance
    And citizens authorize: technical changes through council oversight

  Scenario: Explaining limitations of explainability for complex reasoning
    Given National Council considers requiring perfect explainability
    And I must clarify technical feasibility
    When I testify about explainability tradeoffs
    Then I explain: perfect explainability may be impossible for superintelligent reasoning
    And I clarify: tradeoff between transparency and capability
    And I present: current state of explainability research
    And I acknowledge: we don't know if problem is solvable
    And I avoid: either dismissing explainability importance or promising impossibility
    And I enable: council to make informed choice despite uncertainty
    And delegates decide: values given technical constraints

  Scenario: Testifying to congressional committee on protocol security
    Given Congress considers legislation affecting protocol
    And technical security assessment is needed
    When I testify to legislative committee
    Then I explain: cryptographic foundations and their robustness
    And I assess: attack vectors and defense mechanisms
    And I clarify: what regulation would help vs harm security
    And I present: evidence from adversarial testing
    And I maintain: independence from political pressure
    And I avoid: either advocacy or false neutrality
    And I serve: informed democratic policy making

  Scenario: Collaborating with national research on protocol effectiveness
    Given Dr. Chen studies national sortition governance patterns
    And my technical expertise complements his social science
    When we collaborate on research
    Then I explain: technical mechanisms enabling democratic oversight
    And I help: interpret technical aspects of council decisions
    And I provide: data on agent behavior patterns
    And I respect: his expertise on social and political dynamics
    And we integrate: technical and democratic perspectives
    And collaboration produces: richer understanding than either alone
    And research serves: evidence-based governance improvement

  Scenario: Identifying need for capability limits until problems solved
    Given agents approach human comprehension limits
    And National Council questions if oversight remains meaningful
    When I assess whether democratic governance can continue
    Then I honestly acknowledge: limits of our technical understanding
    And I clarify: what can and cannot be verified currently
    And I explore: research pathways to better explainability
    And I may recommend: limiting agent capability until oversight works
    And I accept: that this may slow AI development
    And I prioritize: democratic governance over technical optimization
    And I demonstrate: humility about technological limits

  Scenario: Advising on national constitutional amendment technical implications
    Given adolescent autonomy amendment is proposed
    And technical implementation is uncertain
    When I explain implementation possibilities to National Council
    Then I clarify: how agents would operationalize new constitutional principle
    And I assess: technical challenges in implementation
    And I identify: what research or development would be needed
    And I avoid: either blocking amendment due to difficulty or ignoring challenges
    And I enable: informed democratic choice about constitutional evolution
    And I serve: constitutional amendment process with technical honesty

  Scenario: Peer reviewing other expert testimony for quality assurance
    Given multiple experts advise National Council
    And peer review prevents individual capture or error
    When I review fellow expert's testimony
    Then I assess: technical accuracy and completeness
    And I identify: bias or conflicts of interest
    And I check: if alternative interpretations exist
    And I verify: adherence to testimony guidelines
    And I provide: constructive critique
    And I accept: critique of my own testimony
    And peer review: maintains expertise quality and independence

  Scenario: Contributing to national appellant bill of rights implementation
    Given National Council established detailed appellant rights
    And technical implementation is needed
    When I help design systems supporting these rights
    Then I specify: technical requirements for appeal interfaces
    And I design: precedent search and tracking systems
    And I ensure: accessibility for users with disabilities
    And I implement: privacy protections for sensitive appeals
    And I test: that systems actually serve appellant rights
    And I demonstrate: technical development implementing constitutional values

  Scenario: Grappling with my influence on decisions affecting millions
    Given my testimony shapes National Council decisions
    And those decisions affect millions of people
    When I reflect on the weight of my responsibility
    Then I feel: burden of expertise influencing democratic governance
    And I worry: about errors in my analysis causing harm
    And I accept: that I must act under uncertainty
    And I commit: to honesty about my limitations
    And I trust: democratic process to weigh my input appropriately
    And I practice: epistemic humility while still providing expertise
    And I demonstrate: expertise serving democracy despite uncertainty
