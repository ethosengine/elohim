Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Preteen
  As a preteen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want to understand how my food choices connect to ecological systems and care labor
  So that I develop stewardship extending beyond my household to the land and people who feed us

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the preteen user "Marcus" is registered in the system
    And Marcus is developing abstract thinking about systems
    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active
    And Marcus makes food decisions with real consequences
    And care economy extends to ecological relationships

  Scenario: Understanding food systems complexity through shopping
    Given Marcus shops regularly and makes food choices
    And food connects to complex agricultural and distribution systems
    When Marcus scans food items
    Then the personal_agent should surface information about food origins
    And it should show where food comes from and who grows it
    And it should explain care labor embedded in food production
    And Marcus should learn that his choices connect to larger systems
    And food system awareness should develop through practice
    And ecological consciousness should build on care economy foundation

  Scenario: Learning connection between budget constraints and farm labor
    Given Marcus experiences severe budget constraints
    And cheap food often reflects exploited farm labor
    When Marcus chooses affordable foods
    Then the personal_agent should help him understand pricing
    And it should explain that low prices often mean low wages for workers
    And it should build empathy for farm workers' care labor
    And Marcus should understand his scarcity connects to their scarcity
    And economic justice awareness should develop
    And care economy should include care for food system workers

  Scenario: Seasonal eating aligned with bioregional food production
    Given seasonal local food is often more affordable
    And Marcus needs to maximize his limited budget
    When Marcus plans meals
    Then the personal_agent should highlight seasonal options
    And it should explain what grows locally in current season
    And it should help him choose foods aligned with bioregional production
    And economic and ecological goals should align
    And he should learn that eating seasonally reduces costs and environmental impact
    And bioregional awareness should develop through practical benefit

  Scenario: Local food systems provide better value and freshness
    Given Marcus shops in specific geographic region
    And locally grown food can be cheaper and fresher
    When Marcus compares food options
    Then the personal_agent should identify local sources
    And it should help him access farmers' markets and local growers
    And it should explain benefits of shorter supply chains
    And local food should be framed as both economic and ecological win
    And he should learn that bioregional food systems serve his needs
    And connection to local land and farmers should develop

  Scenario: Understanding environmental impact of food choices
    Given Marcus is developing capacity for abstract thinking
    And environmental sustainability connects to care economy
    When Marcus makes food choices
    Then the personal_agent should provide age-appropriate environmental information
    And it should explain ecological impact in concrete terms
    And it should not overwhelm him with climate anxiety
    And it should frame environmental care as extension of household care
    And ecological literacy should develop alongside care economy principles
    And stewardship should extend from family to bioregion

  Scenario: Food waste reduction serves both budget and ecology
    Given Marcus must maximize value from $75 budget
    And food waste represents economic and ecological loss
    When Marcus manages food inventory
    Then the personal_agent should help him minimize waste
    And it should track what gets used and what spoils
    And it should suggest meal planning that uses ingredients completely
    And waste reduction should serve both his budget and environment
    And ecological stewardship should align with economic necessity
    And care for resources should extend to caring for earth

  Scenario: Connection to land through understanding food origins
    Given Marcus eats food grown in soil by farmers
    And connection to land is part of ecological literacy
    When Marcus learns about his food sources
    Then the personal_agent should teach bioregional geography
    And it should help him understand local agricultural landscape
    And it should build relationship between Marcus and the land feeding him
    And he should develop sense of place and bioregional identity
    And care economy should include care for ecological systems
    And stewardship should extend beyond human relationships

  Scenario: Learning sustainable farming practices benefit everyone
    Given Marcus is developing systems thinking
    And agricultural practices affect long-term food security
    When Marcus learns about food production methods
    Then the personal_agent should explain sustainable vs. extractive farming
    And it should teach that care for soil creates long-term abundance
    And it should connect farm stewardship to household stewardship
    And he should understand that ecological care serves human flourishing
    And sustainable agriculture should be framed through care economy
    And his generation should expect farming that cares for land

  Scenario: Urban food deserts as ecological and economic justice issue
    Given Marcus may live in urban food desert
    And food access connects to land use and economic systems
    When Marcus experiences difficulty accessing fresh food
    Then he should understand food deserts as systemic failure
    And the personal_agent should explain how urban planning affects food access
    And he should learn that food justice requires ecological and economic change
    And his lived experience should inform political consciousness
    And care economy should include bioregional food sovereignty
    And his struggles should fuel commitment to food system transformation

  Scenario: Water systems and food production understanding
    Given food production requires water resources
    And Marcus is learning about ecological systems
    When Marcus learns about food origins
    Then the personal_agent should teach about water in agriculture
    And it should explain water footprint of different foods
    And it should connect food choices to watershed health
    And bioregional water systems should be part of his literacy
    And he should understand water as precious resource
    And care economy should include stewardship of water

  Scenario: Future orientation toward food system transformation
    Given Marcus experiences food system failures personally
    And he is developing values and political consciousness
    When Marcus reflects on food systems
    Then he should envision better alternatives
    And the personal_agent should present possibilities for transformation
    And it should explain food sovereignty and community agriculture
    And his generation should expect fundamental food system change
    And care economy should provide framework for reimagining food systems
    And his current struggles should fuel commitment to creating just alternatives

  Scenario: Bioregional food networks could serve families like Marcus's
    Given Marcus's family struggles with food budget
    And bioregional food networks could provide affordable access
    When the community_elohim identifies bioregional opportunities
    Then it should connect Marcus to local food networks
    And it should help him access CSA programs, food cooperatives, gleaning
    And bioregional connection should reduce his economic burden
    And local food systems should serve food security goals
    And care economy should operate at bioregional scale
    And connection to land and farmers should benefit all parties

  Scenario: Climate change impacts on food systems understood concretely
    Given climate change affects food production and prices
    And Marcus experiences food cost volatility
    When Marcus encounters price fluctuations
    Then the personal_agent should explain climate impacts on agriculture
    And it should connect extreme weather to food availability
    And climate education should be grounded in lived experience
    And he should understand climate as care economy issue
    And ecological crisis should be framed as requiring care-based response
    And his generation should be prepared to steward through climate chaos
