Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Preteen
  As a preteen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want my care contributions to connect me to community resources and support
  So that my family receives reciprocal care through dignified community networks

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the preteen user "Marcus" is registered in the system
    And Marcus's family participates in community care economy
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim coordinates care exchanges across the community
    And community operates on reciprocity principles, not charity

  Scenario: Care contributions qualify family for community resources
    Given Marcus performs substantial household labor
    And his care contributions are tracked and valued
    When community resource allocation is determined
    Then Marcus's demonstrated stewardship should qualify his family
    And his care tokens should provide access to community support programs
    And access should be based on care contributions, not means testing
    And the framework should be reciprocity: he gives care, community gives care
    And his household labor should be recognized as community contribution
    And resource access should preserve dignity through reciprocity

  Scenario: Community food security programs integrated with Value Scanner
    Given Marcus manages food budget under severe constraints
    And community food security programs exist
    When Marcus's nutritional patterns indicate need
    Then the community_elohim should connect him to food programs
    And integration should be seamless, not requiring separate applications
    And his care contributions should establish eligibility
    And programs should be framed as community care exchanges
    And access should not require stigmatizing means testing
    And food security should be treated as community responsibility

  Scenario: Educational scholarships recognize household stewardship
    Given Marcus demonstrates sophisticated capability through scanner usage
    And educational opportunities require funding
    When scholarship opportunities arise
    Then Marcus's care contributions should be evidence of his capability
    And his resource management skills should be academically recognized
    And community should invest in children demonstrating stewardship
    And scholarships should flow to capable young people like Marcus
    And his household labor should translate to educational opportunity
    And care economy should create pathways to advancement

  Scenario: After-school programs for Keisha accessed through care tokens
    Given Marcus's sister Keisha needs care while Marcus shops
    And after-school programs exist in the community
    When care coordination needs are identified
    Then Marcus's family should access programs through care token economy
    And his care contributions should subsidize Keisha's program costs
    And care economy should coordinate care needs across community
    And Marcus's burden should be reduced through community support
    And reciprocity should frame the exchange, not charity
    And community care should support his family's flourishing

  Scenario: Community recognizes preteen caregivers without exploitation
    Given Marcus represents many young people with household responsibilities
    And community should support rather than exploit young caregivers
    When the community_elohim identifies preteen caregivers
    Then it should channel appropriate support to these families
    And it should prevent exploitation of children's labor
    And it should work to reduce excessive burden on young people
    And it should advocate for family support that makes Marcus's work unnecessary
    And paradoxically, while recognizing his work, it should work toward making it optional
    And care economy should support children while addressing systemic issues

  Scenario: Community care networks provide emergency backup
    Given Marcus's household operates on thin margins
    And emergencies could overwhelm family capacity
    When crisis situations arise
    Then the community_elohim should activate emergency support
    And community care networks should provide rapid assistance
    And Marcus's family should receive help through established relationships
    And emergency support should flow through care economy channels
    And crisis intervention should prevent family breakdown
    And community should function as safety net for vulnerable families

  Scenario: Connection to community resources without stigma
    Given Marcus's family needs support
    And traditional social services often involve stigma
    When Marcus accesses community resources
    Then the protocol should preserve his dignity completely
    And he should not feel like he's receiving charity
    And the framing should always be reciprocal care exchange
    And his contributions should be valued genuinely
    And community support should strengthen rather than shame
    And care economy should eliminate stigma from receiving help

  Scenario: Community-level food justice advocacy informed by preteen experience
    Given Marcus's experience reveals food system failures
    And his data shows food access inequities
    When community food policy is developed
    Then Marcus's anonymized experience should inform advocacy
    And the community_elohim should aggregate data about food insecurity
    And community should advocate for systemic change
    And Marcus's struggles should fuel collective political action
    And care economy should connect individual experience to community organizing
    And his burden should contribute to changing systems that create it

  Scenario: Community mutual aid framework includes youth contributors
    Given Marcus provides substantial care labor
    And mutual aid operates on everyone having something to give
    When community mutual aid networks operate
    Then Marcus should be recognized as legitimate contributor
    And his household labor should count as mutual aid contribution
    And youth should be included in reciprocal care networks
    And age should not exclude him from mutual aid participation
    And community should value care work regardless of who performs it
    And Marcus should experience being valued community member

  Scenario: Transparent community resource allocation based on care contributions
    Given community resources are limited
    And allocation decisions must be made
    When the community_elohim allocates resources
    Then allocation should be based on transparent care economy principles
    And care contributions should influence resource access
    And Marcus's substantial household labor should be weighted appropriately
    And the process should be visible and accountable
    And community members should understand allocation rationale
    And care economy should provide fair distribution framework

  Scenario: Community coordination reduces individual family burden
    Given Marcus carries heavy household responsibility
    And community coordination could reduce this burden
    When the community_elohim identifies systemic solutions
    Then it should propose community-level responses to individual struggles
    And collective action should be suggested: cooperatives, sharing networks, bulk buying
    And Marcus's individual burden should decrease through community organization
    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy reduces isolation
    And community should exist to coordinate care across families
    And systemic support should replace individual heroics where possible

  Scenario: Privacy protection in community care participation
    Given Marcus participates in community care economy
    And his family's specific circumstances are sensitive
    When community resource coordination occurs
    Then Marcus's privacy must be absolutely protected
    And only anonymized data should be visible to community coordinators
    And his specific situation should not be broadcast
    And community support should flow without exposing private struggles
    And dignity requires privacy even while participating in networks
    And the protocol should enable solidarity without surveillance
