Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person
  As a retired person in the value scanner system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to coordinate care flows across generations and life stages
  So that family care responsibilities honor my contributions and prepare for my future needs

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the retired user "Frank" is registered in the system
    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction
    And his family spans three generations: adult children, grandchildren, and aging mother-in-law
    And the family governance context is active
    And family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy
    And Frank contributes care while anticipating future care needs

  Scenario: Multigenerational care coordination across three generations
    Given Frank provides occasional grandchild care
    And he helps maintain his mother-in-law's home
    And he supports his adult children with wisdom and occasional financial help
    When family_elohim coordinates care across generations
    Then it should track care flowing from Frank to grandchildren
    And care flowing from Frank to his mother-in-law
    And support flowing from Frank to adult children
    And emerging care flowing from adult children to Frank
    And all flows should be visible and valued
    And multigenerational reciprocity should be recognized
    And Frank should see himself in ongoing care web

  Scenario: Grandparent care valued as substantial family contribution
    Given Frank provides occasional care for grandchildren
    And this care enables his adult children to work
    And grandparent care provides developmental benefits beyond childcare
    When family_elohim tracks grandparent care contributions
    Then Frank's care labor should be quantified specifically
    And the market value of childcare should be calculated
    And developmental benefits of grandparent relationship should be recognized
    And care should be valued, not assumed as "leisure time with grandkids"
    And Frank's contributions should create legitimate family care tokens
    And his care work should be visible to adult children
    And grandparenting should be recognized as valuable care economy participation

  Scenario: Elder care coordination with spouse for mother-in-law
    Given Frank and his wife help maintain Frank's mother-in-law's home
    And they provide transportation and advocacy support
    And elder care is substantial and skilled labor
    When family_elohim tracks elder care contributions
    Then Frank's home maintenance support should be recognized
    And transportation and medical advocacy should be valued
    And his construction skills applied to elder care should be quantified
    And care burden should be monitored for sustainability
    And family should see Frank's elder care contributions
    And his care work should accumulate family care tokens

  Scenario: Family care tokens reflect Frank's contributions across family
    Given care flows in multiple directions across the family
    And Frank provides grandchild care, elder support, and adult child guidance
    When family_elohim calculates family care tokens
    Then it should track care across all three generations
    And recognize Frank's care for grandchildren and mother-in-law
    And value his support for adult children
    And accumulate tokens representing Frank's family contributions
    And these tokens should create claims on future family support
    And the complex web of family care reciprocity should be visible
    And Frank should see his place in lifecycle care flows

  Scenario: Transitioning from provider to receiver in family care economy
    Given Frank has been primary provider throughout his working life
    And he's now transitioning to more mutual reciprocity
    And he'll eventually need more care than he provides
    When family_elohim tracks the transition
    Then it should recognize Frank continues substantial provision
    And it should help him accept receiving care without shame
    And it should show adult children how to reciprocate care
    And Frank's lifetime of provision should create legitimate claims
    And the transition should preserve his dignity and agency
    And family should prepare for his increasing future needs
    And care reciprocity across lifecycle should be normalized

  Scenario: Teaching adult children care economy principles through modeling
    Given Frank's adult children are watching his care contributions
    And he's modeling post-employment care economy participation
    When family_elohim surfaces care patterns
    Then it should help Frank teach care economy to next generation
    And adult children should see that contribution continues through retirement
    And they should learn that care flows across generations
    And Frank's example should prepare them for their own aging
    And care reciprocity should be transmitted generationally
    And family care culture should strengthen through visible modeling

  Scenario: Family care coordination prevents burnout and exploitation
    Given Frank provides substantial family care across contexts
    And care work can become exploitative even within families
    When family_elohim monitors Frank's care burden
    Then it should flag when contributions exceed sustainable levels
    And surface if family is taking advantage without reciprocation
    And recognize if Frank is sacrificing his wellbeing for family
    And prompt discussions about fair distribution
    And protect Frank from exploitation through visibility
    And ensure family care operates on reciprocity, not extraction
    And support Frank in maintaining boundaries

  Scenario: Family financial coordination for retirement on fixed income
    Given Frank lives on fixed income of $28k/year
    And he occasionally provides financial support to adult children
    And he's managing his mother-in-law's care costs
    When family_elohim coordinates financial flows
    Then it should track Frank's financial contributions to family
    And surface when financial support compromises his own security
    And help family understand his economic constraints
    And facilitate honest conversations about financial capacity
    And protect Frank from unsustainable financial requests
    And ensure his fixed income sustains his own household first

  Scenario: Preparing family for Frank's eventual increased care needs
    Given Frank is currently more provider than receiver
    And his care needs will likely increase in next 10-20 years
    When family_elohim supports care planning
    Then it should help Frank discuss future care needs with family
    And prepare adult children for eventual role reversal
    And surface: "Frank's contributions now create legitimate claims later"
    And facilitate planning conversations that preserve Frank's dignity
    And help family anticipate and prepare for increasing needs
    And ensure Frank experiences agency in planning his aging
    And care reciprocity across time should be made explicit

  Scenario: Family governance includes Frank's voice in his own care planning
    Given family makes decisions that affect Frank's future
    And decisions about his care must honor his autonomy
    When family_elohim facilitates governance decisions
    Then Frank must have primary voice in his own care planning
    And adult children should participate but not dominate
    And Frank's preferences and values must be centered
    And family should plan with him, not for him
    And his decades of life experience should be respected
    And autonomy should be preserved even as needs increase
    And family governance should empower, never infantilize

  Scenario: Wisdom and experience sharing valued as family contribution
    Given Frank has 70 years of life experience and decades of construction expertise
    And his knowledge is valuable family resource
    When family_elohim tracks knowledge sharing
    Then Frank's guidance to adult children should be recognized
    And teaching grandchildren life and practical skills should be valued
    And sharing construction knowledge should be quantified
    And wisdom transmission should count as care contribution
    And family should experience Frank as source of valuable knowledge
    And his expertise should be actively utilized, not patronized
    And knowledge sharing should be reciprocal across generations

  Scenario: Family privacy boundaries negotiated with Frank's control
    Given family coordination requires some information sharing
    And Frank has legitimate need for privacy
    When family_elohim manages privacy
    Then Frank must control what information he shares about himself
    And he should determine what family knows about his health
    And he should decide what adult children know about his finances
    And care coordination should not violate his privacy
    And family should respect his boundaries
    And privacy should balance coordination needs with autonomy
    And Frank's dignity requires control over personal information
