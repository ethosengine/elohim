Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person
  As a retired person managing a household
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want equitable care labor distribution and coordinated aging planning
  So that both partners maintain dignity and partnership through retirement and aging

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the retired user "Frank" is registered in the system
    And Frank shares a household with his wife
    And they live on combined fixed income of $28k/year
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim is coordinating household care economy
    And both partners are retired and managing aging together

  Scenario: Making both partners' retirement care contributions visible
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity
    And his wife contributes different care labor to family and community
    And both provide substantial unpaid care work
    When the household_elohim tracks contributions
    Then both partners' care work should be quantified specifically
    And volunteer labor, family care, and community participation should be valued
    And invisible labor imbalances should become visible
    And both Frank and his wife should see who's doing what
    And data should support equitable distribution conversations
    And both partners' contributions should be recognized and celebrated

  Scenario: Household budget management on fixed retirement income
    Given household operates on $28k/year fixed income
    And income cannot be increased through employment
    And resources must cover housing, food, healthcare, and participation
    When Frank and his wife make household financial decisions
    Then the household_elohim should track spending against fixed budget
    And it should identify optimization opportunities without stigma
    And it should integrate financial constraints with care contribution goals
    And it should help both partners make informed trade-offs
    And budget should reflect care priorities and community participation
    And financial management should maintain dignity and agency

  Scenario: Coordinating household care labor in retirement
    Given Frank and his wife both have time freedom from employment
    And household labor needs to be distributed equitably
    And traditional gender patterns may persist despite retirement
    When the household_elohim monitors labor distribution
    Then it should track household tasks performed by each partner
    And it should identify unfair distributions early
    And it should surface imbalances: "Frank's wife handles 75% of meal preparation"
    And both partners should receive prompts about equity
    And adjustments should be negotiated from data, not resentment
    And retirement should enable more equitable household partnerships

  Scenario: Planning for aging together with dignity and agency
    Given Frank and his wife are both aging
    And their capabilities and care needs will change over time
    And they're committed to supporting each other
    When the household_elohim supports aging planning
    Then it should help them plan for increasing care needs together
    And it should facilitate conversations about future care scenarios
    And it should coordinate with family about eventual support needs
    And it should help them maintain autonomy as long as possible
    And planning should preserve both partners' dignity and agency
    And they should experience aging as partners, not burdens to each other

  Scenario: Household care tokens reflect combined retirement contributions
    Given household participates in care token economy
    And both partners contribute substantial volunteer and family care
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then tokens should accumulate from both partners' contributions
    And Frank's Habitat work should be valued appropriately
    And his wife's care contributions should be recognized
    And household should receive care token supplements for low fixed income
    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status
    And combined contributions should create household care economy resources

  Scenario: Coordinating household participation across multiple contexts
    Given Frank volunteers with Habitat and serves on council
    And his wife has her own community participation
    And both provide family care across generations
    When the household_elohim coordinates participation
    Then it should integrate both partners' schedules and commitments
    And it should prevent household overcommitment
    And it should ensure both partners have rest and personal time
    And it should support diverse participation that serves flourishing
    And coordination should enable rather than constrain engagement
    And household should function as base for community contribution

  Scenario: Managing healthcare costs and coordination for two aging partners
    Given Frank and his wife both have aging-related healthcare needs
    And healthcare costs are significant on fixed income
    And medication management becomes more complex with age
    When the household_elohim coordinates healthcare
    Then it should track both partners' medical appointments and needs
    And it should help manage medication schedules and interactions
    And it should coordinate healthcare spending with household budget
    And it should support both partners in advocating for each other
    And healthcare navigation should be simplified and supported
    And household should maintain health within economic constraints

  Scenario: Household governance decisions made as equal partners
    Given Frank and his wife are equal partners in household
    And both contribute care labor and have voice in decisions
    When household decisions are made
    Then the household_elohim should support collaborative decision-making
    And neither partner should dominate household governance
    And both partners' preferences and needs should have equal weight
    And retirement should enable true partnership, not hierarchy
    And household decisions should serve both partners' flourishing
    And equitable partnership should be structurally supported

  Scenario: Household privacy protected from external surveillance
    Given household care economy generates detailed living pattern data
    And this data reveals intimate household dynamics
    When household data is collected
    Then it must remain under household members' control
    And no external entities should access household data without consent
    And community organizations should only see what's shared
    And family should respect household privacy boundaries
    And healthcare providers should only access consented information
    And household privacy should be absolutely protected

  Scenario: Supporting each other through health challenges
    Given one or both partners may face health crises
    And partners provide mutual care and support
    When the household_elohim tracks caregiving between partners
    Then it should recognize care provided by each partner
    And it should surface when care burden becomes unsustainable
    And it should suggest external support when needed
    And care between partners should be valued and visible
    And the system should protect relationship health under care stress
    And mutual care should strengthen rather than strain partnership

  Scenario: Household food security maintained on fixed budget
    Given household has $140/week grocery budget for two people
    And nutritional needs change with age for both partners
    When the household_elohim supports food planning
    Then it should help maintain nutrition within budget constraints
    And it should coordinate meal planning for both partners' dietary needs
    And it should reduce food waste to maximize budget efficiency
    And it should connect household to community food resources without stigma
    And food security should be maintained with dignity
    And household should not face nutrition inadequacy

  Scenario: Maintaining household independence and self-sufficiency
    Given Frank and his wife value their independence
    And they want to age in place as long as possible
    When the household_elohim supports independence
    Then it should help household maintain self-sufficiency
    And it should optimize resources for maximum autonomy
    And it should coordinate with family without creating dependence
    And it should surface when external support is truly needed
    And household should experience agency and dignity in aging
    And independence should be supported as long as safe and sustainable
