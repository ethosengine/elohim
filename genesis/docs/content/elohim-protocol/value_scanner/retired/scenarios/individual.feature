Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person
  As a retired person in post-employment life in the value scanner system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want my continued care contributions and dignity to be recognized
  So that retirement is experienced as transition to care economy participation, not obsolescence

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the retired user "Frank" is registered in the system
    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction
    And Frank lives on fixed income of $28k/year for himself and spouse
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Frank's personal_agent is configured for dignity preservation
    And the interface is optimized for aging-related accessibility needs

  Scenario: Making post-employment care contributions visible at individual level
    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity
    And he provides occasional grandchild care
    And he helps maintain his mother-in-law's home
    And he serves on his neighborhood council
    When Frank's care contributions are tracked
    Then his personal_agent should quantify all volunteer and care labor
    And it should calculate market value (~$20k/year construction volunteer work)
    And it should accumulate care tokens for all contributions
    And it should make visible that he's highly productive post-retirement
    And Frank should experience himself as valuable contributor, not "not working"
    And the data should counter cultural narrative of retired as obsolete
    And his contributions should be recognized across multiple contexts

  Scenario: Managing fixed income with dignity and sophisticated tools
    Given Frank has $140/week grocery budget for two people
    And his income is fixed at ~$28k/year and cannot be increased through employment
    And he needs to maintain nutrition as dietary needs change with age
    When Frank plans his household shopping
    Then his personal_agent should provide sophisticated budgeting tools
    And it should identify sales and optimize value per dollar
    And it should track spending patterns across weeks and months
    And it should suggest resource optimization without stigma or shame
    And it should help maintain quality of life within real constraints
    And the framing should be dignity-preserving, not scarcity-shaming
    And Frank should experience agency and resourcefulness, not deprivation

  Scenario: Channeling construction expertise to community benefit
    Given Frank has decades of construction knowledge and skills
    And he's now free from employer profit constraints
    And his skills are valuable to community
    When the personal_agent connects Frank to opportunities
    Then it should identify community needs matching his construction expertise
    And it should coordinate Habitat projects utilizing his specific skills
    And it should suggest neighborhood repair opportunities
    And it should facilitate mentoring younger workers
    And it should help him teach construction workshops
    And Frank should experience his knowledge as community asset
    And retirement should feel like liberation to use skills for community good

  Scenario: Building care economy capital for future aging needs
    Given Frank is watching his mother-in-law navigate advanced aging
    And he recognizes his own future care needs will increase
    When Frank makes care contributions now
    Then care tokens should accumulate to his individual account
    And these tokens should represent future care economy resources
    And the system should help him build reciprocal relationships
    And he should be preparing for increased care needs in 10-20 years
    And current contributions should create legitimate claims on future support
    And Frank should experience agency in planning his own aging
    And care reciprocity should flow across time

  Scenario: Personal agent serves Frank's autonomy without infantilizing
    Given Frank is a capable adult with 70 years of life experience
    And he has decades of construction expertise
    And the interface uses AI assistance
    When the personal_agent interacts with Frank
    Then it must preserve his full autonomy and dignity
    And it must never be patronizing or infantilizing
    And it must respect his expertise and judgment
    And it must provide information and options, not directives
    And it must acknowledge his skills and competence
    And the relationship should be respectful partnership
    And Frank should feel empowered and respected, never managed

  Scenario: Accessible interface respects aging-related needs without patronizing
    Given Frank is experiencing some age-related vision changes
    And he may have reduced dexterity for small touch targets
    When Frank uses the Value Scanner interface
    Then the interface should display large, high-contrast fonts
    And touch targets should be large and forgiving
    And voice interface options should be available
    And navigation should be simple and consistent
    And no time-limited interactions should be required
    And the design should be accessible without feeling condescending
    And Frank should experience the interface as respectful and empowering
    And cognitive load should be minimized

  Scenario: Tracking nutritional needs as dietary requirements change with age
    Given Frank's dietary needs are changing as he ages
    And he needs more protein and fiber, less sodium
    And he's managing early indicators of health conditions
    When Frank shops for groceries on fixed budget
    Then his personal_agent should track nutrition across time
    And it should suggest foods appropriate for aging nutritional needs
    And it should flag items high in sodium or added sugars
    And it should highlight protein and fiber-rich options
    And it should balance health needs with budget constraints
    And nutritional guidance should feel supportive, not controlling
    And Frank should maintain full agency over food choices

  Scenario: Privacy control remains with Frank as autonomous adult
    Given Frank's care contribution and health data is being tracked
    And this information is sensitive and personal
    When Frank determines data sharing preferences
    Then he must have complete control over all his data
    And he should choose what's shared with family, organizations, or community
    And he can demonstrate care value to family if he wishes
    And he can maintain complete privacy if he prefers
    And health data sharing must be explicitly consented
    And volunteer coordination can share relevant information
    And Frank's autonomy over his information must be absolute

  Scenario: Maintaining independence through effective resource management
    Given Frank values his independence and self-sufficiency
    And he wants to continue contributing without becoming "a burden"
    When Frank uses the Value Scanner over time
    Then it should help him maintain self-sufficiency and capability
    And it should optimize his resources for maximum independence
    And it should connect him to community resources without stigma
    And it should make his care contributions visible and valued
    And Frank should experience continued agency and autonomy
    And the system should support him in aging on his own terms
    And his continued productivity should be recognized and celebrated

  Scenario: Recognition of care economy contributions builds continued purpose
    Given Frank's contributions are substantial but unpaid
    And traditional economics labels him as "not working"
    And he's navigating the cultural narrative of retirement as obsolescence
    When Frank reviews his care contribution data
    Then he should see quantified value of his volunteer and care labor
    And he should understand his economic contribution is significant (~$20k/year)
    And he should experience himself as productive member of society
    And the narrative of retirement as withdrawal should be countered
    And Frank should have data to assert his continued value
    And his dignity, purpose, and self-worth should be affirmed
    And retirement should feel like transition to different contribution, not exit

  Scenario: Coordinating multiple contexts of care contribution
    Given Frank contributes across multiple contexts simultaneously
    And he volunteers with Habitat, provides family care, serves on council
    When his personal_agent tracks contributions across contexts
    Then it should integrate volunteer work, family care, and civic participation
    And it should coordinate scheduling across multiple commitments
    And it should prevent overcommitment and burnout
    And it should surface conflicts and help prioritize
    And Frank should see his full contribution across all contexts
    And multi-context participation should be supported and celebrated
    And the system should help him balance diverse contributions effectively

  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained throughout system
    Given Frank participates in the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Frank chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then his choice must be honored immediately and completely
    And all data retention must follow minimal legal requirements
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
    And Frank's right to not participate must be absolute
    And his autonomy over technology use must be respected
    And disconnection should be simple, clear, and complete
