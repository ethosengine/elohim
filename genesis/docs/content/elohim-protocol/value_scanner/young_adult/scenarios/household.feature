Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult
  As a young adult managing my first independent household
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want to coordinate shared resources and responsibilities effectively
  So that I build sustainable household management practices

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the young_adult user "Aisha" is registered in the system
    And Aisha lives in her first solo apartment
    And the household governance context is active
    And Aisha's personal_agent coordinates household management
    And household care economy is being tracked

  Scenario: Solo household management learning
    Given Aisha lives alone in her first apartment
    And household and individual layers largely overlap
    When Aisha manages household resources
    Then the personal_agent should help her establish routines
    And it should track household maintenance tasks
    And it should help her build sustainable practices
    And household management should feel achievable, not overwhelming
    And the system should scaffold her household competence development

  Scenario: Coordinating shared household with roommates
    Given Aisha has two roommates
    And the household needs equitable resource distribution
    When the household_elohim coordinates shared responsibilities
    Then it should track each person's contributions
    And it should help distribute household labor fairly
    And it should manage shared grocery purchases
    And it should coordinate cleaning and maintenance tasks
    And the system should make invisible household work visible
    And equity should be maintained through transparent tracking

  Scenario: Shared grocery shopping with roommates
    Given Aisha and her roommates share food costs
    And they have different dietary preferences
    When they use the Value Scanner for shared shopping
    Then the household_elohim should track individual contributions
    And it should manage the shared household budget
    And it should accommodate different preferences within budget
    And care tokens should reflect each person's shopping labor
    And the system should prevent household conflicts over resources
    And equitable cost-sharing should be transparent

  Scenario: Household labor distribution made visible
    Given Aisha does most of the cooking
    And her roommate does most of the cleaning
    When household care contributions are tracked
    Then the household_elohim should make all labor visible
    And it should show time invested by each person
    And it should recognize different forms of household care
    And invisible work should receive equal recognition
    And the system should prevent exploitation through transparency
    And household equity should be data-informed

  Scenario: Building household management skills incrementally
    Given Aisha has never managed a household before
    And she's learning essential adult skills
    When Aisha uses household management features
    Then the personal_agent should teach skills progressively
    And it should provide checklists for routine maintenance
    And it should remind her of non-obvious tasks (changing air filters, etc.)
    And education should integrate with task management
    And Aisha should build comprehensive household competence
    And the learning curve should feel supportive, not judgmental

  Scenario: Managing household budget on entry-level income
    Given Aisha's income is $38,000 annually
    And rent consumes a large portion of her budget
    When Aisha allocates household resources
    Then the personal_agent should help optimize spending
    And it should identify where to invest versus economize
    And it should suggest cost-saving strategies appropriate to her situation
    And budget tools should account for her income constraints
    And the system should help her achieve sustainability within limits

  Scenario: Transition from family household to independent household
    Given Aisha recently moved out of her family home
    And she's adapting to independent household management
    When Aisha establishes her household practices
    Then the system should recognize this is a major transition
    And it should help her adapt family practices to solo living
    And it should provide continuity from family care economy patterns
    And the personal_agent should acknowledge the learning curve
    And support should smooth the jarring transition to full responsibility

  Scenario: Household waste reduction on limited budget
    Given Aisha wants to reduce waste
    And she has limited resources to invest in sustainability
    When the personal_agent analyzes household waste patterns
    Then it should identify specific reduction opportunities
    And it should suggest affordable waste reduction strategies
    And it should track improvement over time
    And recommendations should balance sustainability and budget constraints
    And Aisha should build sustainable household practices within her means

  Scenario: Roommate household operates as miniature care economy
    Given Aisha lives with roommates
    And the household functions as a care economy unit
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then all forms of household labor should be valued
    And cooking, cleaning, shopping, and maintenance should all count
    And emotional labor of household coordination should be recognized
    And care tokens should enable equitable exchange
    And the household should function as mutual support network
    And care economy principles should prevent household exploitation

  Scenario: Household maintenance prevents costly emergencies
    Given Aisha is learning household maintenance
    And prevention is cheaper than emergency repairs
    When the personal_agent tracks household maintenance
    Then it should provide preventive maintenance schedules
    And it should flag issues before they become emergencies
    And it should educate about maintenance tasks Aisha might not know
    And the system should protect her from expensive neglect
    And household competence should include preventive thinking

  Scenario: Transitioning household when roommate moves out
    Given Aisha's roommate is moving out
    And household responsibilities need redistribution
    When the household composition changes
    Then the household_elohim should help manage the transition
    And it should recalculate resource allocations
    And it should settle care token balances fairly
    And it should help Aisha adjust to changed circumstances
    And household transitions should be supported systematically

  Scenario: Building sustainable household routines
    Given Aisha wants to establish effective household practices
    And sustainable routines reduce decision fatigue
    When Aisha develops household routines
    Then the personal_agent should help her establish patterns
    And it should track what routines are working
    And it should suggest optimizations based on her actual behavior
    And routines should be sustainable for her lifestyle and energy
    And the system should help her build household practices that last
