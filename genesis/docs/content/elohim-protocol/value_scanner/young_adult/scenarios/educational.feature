Feature: Educational Layer Value Literacy for Young Adult
  As a young adult continuing my education and development
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to learn practical life skills and develop capabilities
  So that I build competence for lifelong flourishing

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the young_adult user "Aisha" is registered in the system
    And Aisha is 23 years old in early independence
    And formal education didn't teach household management skills
    And the educational governance context is active
    And lifelong learning is essential for adult life
    And the Value Scanner serves as practical education system

  Scenario: Learning household management skills not taught in formal education
    Given Aisha's college education didn't include life skills
    And she needs practical household management capabilities

    Then the personal_agent should teach grocery shopping efficiency
    And it should provide meal planning education

    And it should teach budgeting through actual practice
    And it should explain concepts like opportunity cost
    And it should help her understand efficiency frontiers
    And financial literacy should build through supported real-world decisions
    And mistakes should be learning opportunities, not catastrophes

  Scenario: Nutrition education integrated with shopping decisions
    Given Aisha wants to eat healthfully
    And she has limited nutrition knowledge
    When Aisha selects food items
    Then the personal_agent should provide nutrition education
    And it should explain nutritional value of options
    And it should teach balancing nutrition with budget
    And it should help her understand dietary needs
    And learning should integrate seamlessly with decision-making
    And nutrition literacy should develop through practice

  Scenario: Learning cooking skills progressively through recipe suggestions
    Given Aisha has minimal cooking experience
    And she wants to develop culinary capability
    When the personal_agent suggests recipes
    Then recommendations should match her current skill level
    And difficulty should increase gradually as she learns
    And it should teach techniques through practice
    And it should explain why certain methods work
    And cooking education should be progressive and achievable
    And she should build confidence and competence incrementally

  Scenario: Understanding value creation through care economy education
    Given traditional economics education emphasizes market transactions
    And Aisha is learning care economy principles
    When the personal_agent teaches value concepts
    Then it should explain how care creates value
    And it should teach that invisible work is valuable
    And it should explain care token economics
    And it should help her understand reciprocal care systems
    And care economy literacy should provide alternative to market capitalism
    And foundational economic understanding should center care

  Scenario: Learning from mistakes without shame or judgment
    Given Aisha will make errors as she learns
    And learning requires safe failure
    When Aisha makes suboptimal decisions
    Then the personal_agent should provide constructive feedback
    And it should explain what happened and why
    And it should suggest better approaches for future
    And feedback should be educational, never judgmental
    And mistakes should be treated as learning opportunities
    And the system should create psychologically safe learning environment

  Scenario: Developing critical thinking about consumption and marketing
    Given consumer marketing targets young adults intensively
    And Aisha needs media literacy
    When Aisha encounters marketing messages
    Then the personal_agent should help her think critically
    And it should explain marketing tactics and manipulation
    And it should teach distinguishing needs from manufactured wants
    And consumer education should support autonomous decision-making
    And she should learn to resist exploitative marketing
    And critical consumption literacy should be developed

  Scenario: Educational resources for continuing professional development
    Given adult learning is lifelong
    And Aisha wants professional skill development
    When Aisha seeks professional education
    Then the personal_agent should surface relevant learning resources
    And it should connect her to workshops, courses, or certifications
    And it should help her plan skill development trajectory
    And professional education should be accessible and affordable
    And the system should support continuous capability building
    And career growth should be facilitated through education access

  Scenario: Learning sustainable practices within budget constraints
    Given Aisha wants to be environmentally responsible
    And she has limited financial resources
    When the personal_agent teaches sustainability
    Then education should address real budget limitations
    And it should teach affordable sustainable practices
    And it should explain trade-offs between cost and environmental impact
    And sustainability education should be practical, not preachy
    And she should learn to make values-aligned choices within constraints
    And environmental literacy should respect economic reality

  Scenario: Peer learning networks facilitated through care economy
    Given young adults learn effectively from peers
    And Aisha's peers face similar challenges
    When Aisha connects with peers through the system
    Then the personal_agent should facilitate peer learning
    And it should enable knowledge exchange among young adults
    And it should coordinate peer teaching and support
    And collective learning should be more effective than isolated struggle
    And peer networks should be educational resources
    And mutual learning should strengthen community

  Scenario: Teaching healthy boundary-setting and self-advocacy
    Given Aisha needs to learn professional and personal boundaries
    And boundary-setting is rarely taught explicitly
    When the personal_agent provides guidance
    Then it should teach how to set healthy boundaries
    And it should model self-advocacy language and approaches
    And it should help her recognize when boundaries are needed
    And the system should educate about sustainable capacity management
    And she should learn that boundaries enable sustainable care
    And self-advocacy should be taught as essential life skill

  Scenario: Learning value literacy through concrete application
    Given abstract economic theory is less effective than practice
    And Aisha learns best through direct experience
    When Aisha uses the Value Scanner
    Then value education should happen through application
    And concepts should be taught in context of real decisions
    And theory should emerge from practice
    And learning should be concrete and immediately applicable
    And value literacy should develop through lived experience
    And education should be embodied, not abstract

  Scenario: Access to mentoring and guidance from experienced adults
    Given Aisha can benefit from elder wisdom
    And mentoring relationships support development
    When Aisha seeks guidance
    Then the system should connect her to mentors
    And it should facilitate intergenerational knowledge transfer
    And experienced adults should share practical wisdom
    And mentoring should be valued as care work
    And the educational layer should include relationship-based learning
    And she should have access to guidance beyond peer knowledge

  Scenario: Educational privacy protects learning data from exploitation
    Given Aisha's learning patterns generate valuable data
    And educational data is often exploited commercially
    When educational data is collected
    Then it must be used only to improve educational outcomes
    And Aisha's privacy must be absolutely protected
    And no commercial exploitation of learning data should occur
    And data should serve her learning, not surveillance capitalism
    And educational privacy must be maintained
    And learning should never be monetized
