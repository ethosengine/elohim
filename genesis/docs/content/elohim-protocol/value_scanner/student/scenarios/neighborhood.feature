Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Student
  As a student living temporarily in a college neighborhood
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to participate in local care economy as real community member
  So that I build belonging and contribute to neighborhood flourishing now

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the student user "Kenji" is registered in the system
    And Kenji lives in a college neighborhood
    And Kenji's residency is temporary (likely leaving after graduation)
    And the neighborhood includes students and long-term residents
    And Kenji shops locally and walks the neighborhood daily
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim could coordinate local care economy

  Scenario: Student recognized as real neighborhood member despite temporary status
    Given Kenji will likely move after graduation
    And neighborhoods often treat students as temporary non-members
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks neighborhood participation
    Then it should recognize students as current, real residents
    And it should value Kenji's presence now, not discount it as temporary
    And it should include him in neighborhood decision-making
    And temporary residency should not exclude from community membership
    And the system should counteract student marginalization
    And Kenji should experience genuine neighborhood belonging

  Scenario: Shopping locally contributes to neighborhood economy
    Given Kenji buys groceries at neighborhood corner store and farmer's market
    And local shopping supports neighborhood businesses
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks local economic participation
    Then it should recognize Kenji's local purchases as neighborhood contribution
    And it should show him "You've spent $X at local businesses this month"
    And it should help him understand his economic impact on neighborhood
    And local shopping should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should make visible how spending choices support community
    And students should see themselves as neighborhood economic participants

  Scenario: Navigating student-resident tensions in shared neighborhood
    Given long-term residents might resent student noise, parties, or turnover
    And students might be unaware of neighborhood norms
    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates student-resident relationships
    Then it should educate students about neighborhood expectations
    And it should help residents recognize students as temporary but real members
    And it should facilitate communication between students and long-term residents
    And it should build understanding across different neighborhood groups
    And the system should reduce student-resident conflict
    And mixed neighborhoods should be navigable for all residents

  Scenario: Participating in neighborhood care economy with limited resources
    Given Kenji has severe resource constraints
    And he cannot contribute financially to neighborhood projects
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks care contributions
    Then it should recognize non-financial contributions Kenji can make
    And it should value his labor, time, and presence
    And it should show "Kenji helped neighbor carry groceries: 2 care tokens"
    And participation should not require money
    And the system should enable care economy participation at all resource levels
    And students should contribute to neighborhood based on capacity

  Scenario: Learning neighborhood as governance unit
    Given Kenji is learning how communities function
    And neighborhood is often invisible as governance layer
    When the personal_agent teaches Kenji about neighborhood governance
    Then it should help him see neighborhood as care coordination unit
    And it should show how neighborhoods make collective decisions
    And it should teach him that geography creates shared stakes
    And neighborhood should be understood as governance layer
    And the system should build Kenji's civic literacy
    And students should learn that neighborhoods govern local flourishing

  Scenario: Connecting to neighborhood resources appropriate for students
    Given Kenji has limited budget and might face emergencies
    And neighborhoods often have resources (food banks, tool libraries, mutual aid)
    When the neighborhood_elohim connects Kenji to resources
    Then it should inform him of neighborhood food bank access
    And it should show shared resources: "Neighborhood tool library 3 blocks away"
    And it should reduce barriers to accessing community support
    And it should normalize resource sharing as care economy
    And the system should connect students to neighborhood safety nets
    And resource access should be dignified and easy

  Scenario: Student contribution to neighborhood safety and mutual care
    Given Kenji walks neighborhood streets regularly
    And neighborhood safety is collective responsibility
    When Kenji participates in neighborhood mutual care
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize his watchfulness
    And it should value informal safety contributions: checking on neighbors, reporting issues
    And it should accumulate care tokens for neighborhood care work
    And students should be recognized as safety contributors, not threats
    And the system should value informal mutual aid
    And neighborhood care should be understood as everyone's work

  Scenario: Neighborhood environmental stewardship
    Given Kenji is studying environmental science
    And neighborhoods are environmental governance units
    When Kenji participates in neighborhood environmental care
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize his stewardship work
    And it should value his participation in neighborhood cleanup
    And it should recognize his knowledge contributions about sustainability
    And environmental care should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should connect academic learning to neighborhood action
    And students should contribute environmental expertise to neighborhoods

  Scenario: Building neighborhood relationships across demographic differences
    Given Kenji's neighborhood includes diverse ages, incomes, and backgrounds
    And care economy requires bridging difference
    When Kenji builds relationships with non-student neighbors
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize cross-demographic care work
    And it should value relationships with elderly neighbors, families, workers
    And it should show how diverse relationships strengthen neighborhood
    And bridging work should be recognized as care contribution
    And the system should foster inclusive neighborhood community
    And students should learn to build community across difference

  Scenario: Temporary residency patterns and neighborhood turnover
    Given student neighborhoods have high turnover
    And institutional knowledge is lost with each cohort
    When the neighborhood_elohim manages turnover
    Then it should preserve neighborhood practices across student generations
    And it should help new students learn neighborhood norms quickly
    And it should maintain neighborhood continuity despite turnover
    And transient residents should still build lasting neighborhood patterns
    And the system should stabilize high-turnover neighborhoods
    And neighborhood culture should persist beyond individual residents

  Scenario: Neighborhood as site for practicing civic participation
    Given Kenji is learning how democratic participation works
    And neighborhood is most accessible governance layer
    When Kenji participates in neighborhood meetings or decisions
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should recognize civic participation as care work
    And it should accumulate care tokens for attending meetings, voting on issues
    And it should teach him that democracy requires participation labor
    And civic work should be valued as care economy contribution
    And the system should build habits of democratic participation
    And students should practice civic engagement at neighborhood scale

  Scenario: Balancing neighborhood participation with student time constraints
    Given Kenji has limited time between school and work
    And neighborhood participation requires time investment
    When the neighborhood_elohim helps Kenji manage participation
    Then it should help him identify high-impact, low-time contributions
    And it should validate that he can't participate in everything
    And it should show: "30 minutes at neighborhood meeting = valuable contribution"
    And participation should be realistic for student schedules
    And the system should enable partial participation as valid
    And students should participate at sustainable levels
