Feature: Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Student
  As a student working part-time to support educational and basic needs
  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer
  I want fair treatment, recognition of my constraints, and care economy awareness
  So that my work supports rather than undermines my development and well-being

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the student user "Kenji" is registered in the system

    And Kenji must balance work hours with academic demands
    And Kenji works in service industry (restaurant or retail)
    And the workplace governance context is active
    And the workplace_elohim could support worker rights and fair treatment
    And Kenji is learning to navigate employment for first time

  Scenario: Work schedule flexibility for academic obligations
    Given Kenji must attend classes and cannot work during certain hours
    And exam periods require reduced work availability
    When Kenji's workplace_elohim advocates for schedule flexibility
    Then it should help Kenji communicate academic constraints to employer

  Scenario: Fair compensation and wage theft prevention
    Given Kenji depends on every dollar he earns
    And low-wage employers sometimes violate wage laws
    When the workplace_elohim monitors Kenji's compensation

    And it should flag if he's working off-clock or unpaid
    And it should teach him to recognize wage theft
    And it should help him assert right to legal minimum wage
    And the system should protect vulnerable student workers from exploitation

    And student workers should know and exercise their rights

  Scenario: Recognizing when work serves vs. exploits community needs

    And it should recognize that serving food can be care economy work
    And it should help him evaluate whether his workplace aligns with care values
    And the system should build critical awareness of workplace care economy
    And Kenji should understand his labor through care economy lens

  Scenario: Workplace relationships and peer support

    And the system should foster cooperative rather than competitive workplace culture
    And Kenji should build care relationships with fellow workers
