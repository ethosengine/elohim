# Student - Value Scanner

## Archetype

Kenji is 20, a college sophomore studying environmental science while working part-time (15 hours/week) to supplement his financial aid. He lives in a shared apartment with three roommates, manages a tight budget ($180/week for all expenses including food), coordinates household shopping and cooking responsibilities, and tries to maintain nutrition and well-being amid academic pressure and financial stress. He uses the Value Scanner to manage his personal grocery budget ($50/week), coordinate bulk buying with roommates, learn to cook efficiently, reduce food waste, and understand value literacy as he transitions from family-supported life to adult independence. He's also contributing care work to his household—he's the primary cook among roommates, providing nutrition care for four people.

Kenji represents students as a distinct user type—people whose primary "work" is learning and development, but who also manage household economics, provide care labor (for themselves and often others), and participate in community care economy. Students are often seen as temporary, transient, not-yet-adults—but they're actually active participants in care economy right now, developing patterns that will shape their entire adult lives. The Value Scanner serves Kenji by teaching practical care economy skills (household management, resource stewardship, value literacy), making his care contributions visible (cooking for roommates is care work), and connecting him to community resources appropriate for students.

What distinguishes Kenji from other young adults is his primary identity as learner—he's investing in long-term capability development while managing immediate survival needs on very limited resources. He's also often geographically separated from family care networks, learning to build new care relationships in temporary communities (college, neighborhoods he'll leave after graduation). The protocol helps him develop care economy literacy that will serve him throughout adult life while supporting his current needs and contributions.

## Core Needs

- **Learning Practical Care Economy Skills**: Kenji needs to develop household management capabilities that formal education doesn't teach. The Value Scanner serves as his teacher: how to shop efficiently, plan meals, cook nutritiously on a budget, reduce waste, coordinate with roommates, manage scarcity, and build sustainable patterns. His personal_agent provides patient instruction adapted to his learning pace—he's developing life skills through practice with good support. These capabilities will serve him throughout adult life.

- **Managing Extreme Resource Constraint**: Kenji's $50/week grocery budget requires sophisticated value literacy. He needs tools that help him maximize nutrition per dollar, identify efficient foods, plan meals that stretch ingredients, shop strategically across stores, and coordinate bulk buying with roommates. The Value Scanner helps him be skilled at resource management under constraint—building capabilities that will serve him even when he's less resource-constrained later.

- **Recognition for Household Care Contributions**: Kenji provides substantial care work for his roommate household—he's the primary cook, meal planner, and often the grocery shopper. In traditional economics, this is invisible—he's "just" making food for himself and happens to share. But he's actually performing care labor that benefits four people and makes shared living functional. The Value Scanner makes this visible through care token accumulation—his roommates can see his contributions, enabling fair household labor distribution.

- **Building Care Economy Networks in Temporary Communities**: Kenji is geographically separated from family and living in a temporary college community he'll likely leave after graduation. He needs to build care economy relationships here and now—roommate coordination, student mutual aid networks, neighborhood resource sharing, community connections. The protocol helps him participate in care economy wherever he is, learning that community is built through care relationships, not just inherited through geography or family.

- **Connecting Learning to Care Economy Values**: Kenji's academic work (environmental science) connects to care economy principles—stewardship of ecological systems is care work scaled to planetary level. The Value Scanner could help him see connections between his shopping choices (personal care economy), his academic learning (professional care economy preparation), and his future work (contributing to collective flourishing). He's developing integrated understanding of care economy across contexts.

## Key Relationships

**To Roommates**: Kenji's roommate relationships involve substantial care economy coordination—shopping, cooking, household labor distribution, shared resource management, conflict navigation. The Value Scanner helps make contributions visible (preventing the resentment of invisible labor) and coordinate fairly (ensuring equity in labor distribution). He's learning how shared households function as miniature care economies.

**To Family**: Kenji maintains connection to his family care economy despite geographic distance. He might receive some financial support from family, provide emotional support or practical help remotely, and participate in family decisions. The family_elohim helps coordinate across distance. He's learning how family care relationships continue even as he establishes independence.

**To Educational Institution**: Kenji's relationship with his college is complex—it's providing educational value (teaching, credential, development) while extracting resources (tuition, time, labor). He's navigating this exchange and learning to recognize when educational institutions fail care economy principles (exploitative labor, inadequate support, extractive financial models).

**To Employer/Workplace**: Kenji's part-time work is his economic lifeline. His workplace_elohim could help him understand his labor rights, recognize fair compensation, negotiate scheduling around academic demands, and see his work as care contribution (service work serves community needs). He's learning to navigate employment with care economy awareness.

**To Student Community**: Kenji participates in student care economy networks—study groups (knowledge exchange), meal sharing (food cooperation), mutual aid (emergency support), collective action (advocating for student needs). These networks are practice for lifelong care economy participation. He's learning that community is built through reciprocal care.

**To Neighborhood**: Kenji lives in a neighborhood surrounding campus. He might participate in neighborhood care economy—local shopping, community events, resource sharing. He's learning that neighborhoods are governance units that coordinate care, not just geographic locations.

**To Personal Agent**: Kenji's personal_agent is his teacher, advisor, and support system as he develops adult capabilities. The agent helps him learn household management, navigate resource constraint, coordinate with roommates, connect to community, and integrate care economy principles across his life contexts.

## Relevant Governance Layers

### Geographic/Political

**Individual Layer**
Kenji exercises adult autonomy—making his own decisions about resources, time, learning, relationships, and life direction. His personal_agent serves his individual flourishing and capability development.

**Household Layer**
Kenji participates in roommate household governance—coordinating with three other people around shared resources, labor distribution, household norms, and shared living. He's learning how households function as economic and care units.

**Family Layer**
Kenji maintains connection to his origin family while establishing independence. He participates in family governance from a distance, now as an emerging adult rather than a dependent child.

**Neighborhood Layer**
Kenji engages his college neighborhood as a temporary but real community member—shopping locally, participating when he has time, contributing to neighborhood patterns.

**Community Layer**
Kenji participates in student community and broader local community care economy—mutual aid networks, resource sharing, collective advocacy, community building.

### Functional

**Educational Layer**
Education is Kenji's primary governance context—his time, energy, resources, and development are largely shaped by educational institutions and norms. He's learning to navigate educational systems while maintaining care economy awareness.

**Workplace/Organizational Layer**
Kenji's part-time employment introduces him to workplace governance. He's learning about labor, compensation, rights, and how employment can align or conflict with care economy principles.

**Ecological/Bioregional Layer**
Kenji's academic focus (environmental science) makes ecological governance particularly relevant. He's learning to see his consumption and care practices as participating in larger ecological systems. The Value Scanner helps connect his shopping choices to ecological care economy.

## Implementation Notes

- **Technical**: Interface should support student realities—mobile-first (students are mobile and digitally-fluent stewards of their own data), budget optimization tools (severe resource constraint), roommate coordination features (shared household management), meal planning for beginners (learning to cook), community connection tools (building care networks in temporary communities). Personal_agent should function as patient teacher—helping Kenji learn care economy skills through practice with good feedback.

- **Privacy**: Kenji controls his own data as independent adult. He might share household information with roommates (coordinating shopping, labor), financial contributions with family (if they're supporting him), care contributions with community (accessing student resources). He's learning to manage privacy as adult practice.

- **Interface**: Design for young, digitally fluent user under time and resource pressure. Clean, efficient, mobile-optimized. Comparison and planning tools prominent (students are learning to make efficient choices). Educational features that teach while supporting (learning cooking, nutrition, budgeting, household management). Recognition of care contributions should feel genuine. Interface should reduce cognitive load while building capability.

- **Constraints**: Safety nets important—if Kenji's nutrition is suffering, if financial scarcity becomes dangerous, if academic pressure creates crisis, if housing becomes unstable, protocol should connect to student support resources (food banks, emergency aid, counseling, housing assistance). Students are often vulnerable despite appearing capable.

- **Opportunities**: Students are developing patterns that will shape their entire adult lives. If Kenji learns care economy principles during college—value literacy, household care coordination, reciprocal community participation, resource stewardship—he'll carry those patterns throughout adulthood. Students are also highly networked and trend-setting—care economy practices that spread among students could viral throughout their generation. This demographic is forming adult identities and economic patterns—the protocol can shape what they consider "normal" for household economics, community participation, and value literacy. If millions of students adopt care economy practices, they'll enter adult employment, family formation, and civic life expecting care economy principles—potentially transforming broader culture rapidly. Students are also often politically engaged and idealistic—care economy aligns with their values around sustainability, equity, and community. They could become powerful advocates for systemic care economy transformation.
