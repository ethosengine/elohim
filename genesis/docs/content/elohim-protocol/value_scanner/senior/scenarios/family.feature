Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Senior
  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want my multigenerational care contributions to be visible and valued
  So that family care economy operates on reciprocity and recognition, not invisibility

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the senior user "Margaret" is registered in the system
    And Margaret participates in multigenerational family care
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim coordinates family care economy
    And Margaret has adult children, grandchildren, and an aging mother

  Scenario: Grandchild care contributions made visible to family
    Given Margaret provides 15 hours/week of grandchild care
    And this care has market value of approximately $15k/year
    When the family_elohim tracks Margaret's care contributions
    Then the care labor should be quantified and visible
    And her daughter should see specific care contributions
    And the data should show "Margaret provided 60 hours of childcare this month"
    And the economic value should be calculated and displayed
    And Margaret's care work should be recognized, not taken for granted
    And family care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions
    And genuine appreciation should be enabled through visibility

  Scenario: Reciprocal care flows between Margaret and adult children
    Given Margaret provides childcare for her daughter's family
    And her daughter provides technology help and transportation
    When the family_elohim coordinates these reciprocal care exchanges
    Then all care flows should be tracked in both directions
    And Margaret gives care (grandchildren); daughter gives care (support)
    And reciprocity should be visible to prevent imbalance
    And both generations' contributions should be valued
    And the relationship should feel equitable, not one-sided
    And multigenerational care patterns should be sustainable

  Scenario: Elder care for Margaret's mother made visible and valued
    Given Margaret provides 8 hours/week care coordination for her mother
    And Margaret's nursing background makes her care highly skilled
    When Margaret's elder care contributions are tracked
    Then the sophisticated care labor should be recognized
    And the time, skill, and emotional labor should be quantified
    And Margaret's siblings should see her care contributions
    And family resource allocation should reflect her caregiving
    And elder care should be valued as the skilled work it is
    And Margaret's contributions should give her voice in mother's care decisions

  Scenario: Family care burden monitoring prevents Margaret's burnout
    Given Margaret provides care across three generations
    And she has limited time and energy
    When the family_elohim monitors total care burden
    Then it should track cumulative care hours across all relationships
    And it should flag when burden becomes unsustainable
    And it should surface need for family conversation about distribution
    And Margaret's own needs should be protected
    And the system should prevent exploitation disguised as family care
    And burnout prevention should be built into family coordination

  Scenario: Family decision-making includes Margaret's voice
    Given Margaret makes substantial contributions to family flourishing
    And family decisions affect her care capacity
    When family decisions are being made
    Then Margaret's care contributions should give her legitimate standing
    And her voice should carry weight in family governance
    And decisions should consider impact on her care capacity
    And Margaret should be respected as autonomous adult contributor
    And family governance should be multigenerational and equitable
    And her retirement doesn't diminish her authority in family

  Scenario: Teaching and mentoring grandchildren as valued care work
    Given Margaret provides not just childcare but teaching and mentoring
    And she's passing on knowledge, values, and skills
    When the family_elohim tracks educational care contributions
    Then it should recognize teaching as distinct care category
    And it should track skill-building and mentoring activities
    And the long-term value of grandparent teaching should be recognized
    And Margaret's role in grandchildren's development should be visible
    And intergenerational knowledge transmission should be valued
    And cultural/family traditions taught by Margaret should be tracked

  Scenario: Coordinating Margaret's mother's care among siblings
    Given Margaret has siblings who also have responsibilities to their mother
    And Margaret currently does most hands-on care
    When the family_elohim coordinates elder care among siblings
    Then all siblings' contributions should be visible
    And disparities in care burden should be evident
    And fair distribution conversations should be supported by data
    And Margaret should not bear disproportionate burden invisibly
    And sibling care economy should operate on transparency
    And family equity should be maintained across distance and circumstance

  Scenario: Family food sharing and meal provision as care contribution
    Given Margaret sometimes cooks meals for her daughter's family
    And she hosts family dinners and holiday meals
    When Margaret's food provision is tracked as care
    Then meal preparation and hosting should be recognized as labor
    And the economic value of meals provided should be calculated
    And family food sharing should be visible care contribution
    And Margaret's cooking and hospitality should be valued
    And food as care should be part of family care economy
    And invisible domestic labor should become visible

  Scenario: Supporting adult children through financial constraints
    Given Margaret has very limited resources herself
    And her adult children sometimes face financial challenges
    When Margaret provides non-financial support
    Then her care contributions should be recognized as valuable
    And the family_elohim should show how her labor saves money
    And childcare provided prevents need for paid care
    And her contributions have real economic impact
    And Margaret's value to family doesn't require financial resources
    And care economy should be visible alongside financial economy

  Scenario: Planning for Margaret's own future care needs
    Given Margaret is providing care now but will need care eventually
    And she's watching her mother's care requirements
    When the family_elohim facilitates future care planning
    Then Margaret's current care contributions should build future care security
    And family should understand reciprocal care obligations
    And Margaret's care tokens should represent future care resources
    And conversations about her eventual needs should be normalized
    And family should prepare for role reversal
    And Margaret should have agency in planning her own future care

  Scenario: Protecting Margaret's time for self-care and personal life
    Given Margaret's family depends on her care contributions
    And she needs time for her own health and well-being
    When the family_elohim monitors Margaret's time allocation
    Then it should protect her time for personal needs
    And it should flag when family demands encroach on self-care
    And Margaret should be supported in setting boundaries
    And family should understand that her care capacity requires self-care
    And she should be encouraged to maintain her own friendships and interests
    And the system should prevent family from consuming all her time

  Scenario: Multigenerational family gatherings coordinated with care recognition
    Given Margaret often hosts or coordinates family gatherings
    And these gatherings require significant labor
    When Margaret organizes family events
    Then the planning, preparation, and hosting labor should be tracked
    And other family members should see the work involved
    And equitable distribution of hosting burden should be encouraged
    And Margaret's contributions should be recognized and appreciated
    And family gatherings should not depend on her invisible labor
    And care work that makes family connection possible should be valued
