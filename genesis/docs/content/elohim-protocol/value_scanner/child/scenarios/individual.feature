Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Child
  As a child (ages 8-10) in guided autonomy
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want to make real choices with real consequences
  So that I develop agency and learn that I am a capable steward of resources

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the child user "Emma" is registered in the system
    And Emma is 8 years old
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Emma's personal_agent is configured for guided learning through inquiry
    And Emma has demonstrated capacity for age-appropriate autonomy
    And parental oversight is enabled with expanded boundaries

  Scenario: Child makes genuine autonomous decision with real consequences
    Given Emma is selecting cereal in the store aisle
    And she is using the Value Scanner independently
    And her family will actually eat the cereal she chooses
    When Emma compares store brand and name brand cereals
    Then her personal_agent should present factual information
    And the agent should say "The store brand has the same protein as the name brand, and it's $2 less"
    And Emma should make the final choice herself
    And her choice should be what the family purchases
    And the consequences should be real but age-appropriate
    And Emma should experience the weight of genuine decision-making

  Scenario: Learning value beyond price through multi-dimensional comparison
    Given Emma is evaluating fair-trade chocolate
    And she has capacity for understanding multiple value dimensions
    When Emma scans the chocolate product
    Then her personal_agent should show nutritional value
    And the agent should show environmental impact
    And the agent should explain care labor: "The farmers who grew this were paid fairly for their care work"
    And the agent should show community benefit
    And price should be one factor among many
    And Emma should learn to read the world's complexity, not just price tags
    And value literacy should extend beyond simple cost comparison

  Scenario: Recognition as capable contributor not just cute helper
    Given Emma has made a budget-conscious choice
    And she selected store brand cereal to save money
    When the transaction is complete
    Then the recognition should be specific and substantive
    And her personal_agent should say "Your choice saved $2, which helped the family stay within budget"
    And the feedback should acknowledge real impact
    And Emma should not receive patronizing praise
    And her contribution should be valued as genuine stewardship
    And she should build identity as capable resource manager
    And recognition should reflect that her work actually matters

  Scenario: Guided learning through Socratic questioning not instruction
    Given Emma is comparing two products
    And her personal_agent uses inquiry-based teaching
    When Emma asks for help deciding
    Then the agent should ask "What do you notice about these two options?"
    And the agent should not say "Choose this one"
    And the agent should prompt critical thinking
    And the agent should ask follow-up questions based on Emma's observations
    And Emma should develop her own reasoning capacity
    And she should learn to think, not just follow rules
    And the pedagogical approach should respect her as a thinker

  Scenario: Safe practice environment with age-appropriate mistakes
    Given Emma makes a choice that doesn't align with family needs
    And she selected a more expensive option without considering budget
    When the family experiences the consequence
    Then her personal_agent should guide gentle reflection
    And the agent should ask "How did that work out?"
    And Emma should learn from the mistake without shame
    And consequences should be educational, not punitive
    And she should build judgment through safe practice
    And mistakes should be treated as learning opportunities
    And the stakes should be appropriately low for her age

  Scenario: Individual autonomy expanding based on demonstrated capability
    Given Emma has shown good stewardship decisions over time
    And parents can adjust autonomy levels in the system
    When Emma's decision-making patterns are reviewed
    Then her boundaries should expand to reflect capability
    And she should earn more freedom through demonstrated judgment
    And the system should track maturity indicators
    And Emma should understand that autonomy grows with responsibility
    And her increasing capability should be recognized
    And freedom should be matched to demonstrated stewardship

  Scenario: Personal values forming through conscious choice-making
    Given Emma is making repeated value-based decisions
    And she is old enough to articulate reasons for choices
    When Emma reflects on why she makes certain choices
    Then her personal_agent should help her identify her values
    And the agent should ask "What matters to you about this choice?"
    And Emma should begin to consciously understand her value framework
    And her values should be forming through reflection, not imposition
    And she should develop moral reasoning capacity
    And individual value formation should be supported

  Scenario: Privacy protection with emerging concept of data awareness
    Given Emma's choices and decision patterns are being tracked
    And she is beginning to understand privacy concepts
    When Emma's data is collected
    Then all data must stay encrypted on family devices
    And no commercial exploitation should occur
    And Emma should receive age-appropriate education about privacy
    And she should learn why data protection matters
    And the agent should explain "Your information is private and protected"
    And Emma should begin understanding data as something to steward
    And consent education should begin at this developmental stage

  Scenario: Transparent boundaries that Emma can understand and learn from
    Given Emma operates within parental boundaries
    And she is old enough to understand limits
    When Emma encounters a boundary (allergen, budget, nutrition)
    Then the boundary should be explained transparently
    And the agent should say "This exceeds the family budget we're working within"
    And Emma should see and understand the limits
    And boundaries should be teaching tools, not just restrictions
    And she should learn that all autonomy operates within contexts
    And transparency should build understanding of constraint reasoning

  Scenario: Building neural pathways for care-based economic thinking
    Given Emma's brain is highly plastic during ages 8-10
    And repeated patterns shape lifelong thinking
    When Emma makes value decisions consistently
    Then she should internalize that resources are for stewardship
    And she should learn that choices affect others' flourishing
    And she should understand that care creates value
    And neural pathways around care economy thinking should form
    And these patterns should serve her entire life
    And she should develop alternative to extraction-based economics

  Scenario: Right to genuine autonomy within developmentally appropriate scope
    Given Emma deserves real agency not simulated choice
    And she is capable of meaningful decision-making at age 8
    When Emma uses the Value Scanner
    Then her choices must be genuinely honored
    And she must have actual decision-making power
    And the autonomy must be real within appropriate boundaries
    And she must experience that her agency matters
    And constitutional protections apply to her dignity
    And her humanity requires genuine respect for her capability

  Scenario: Interface designed for developing literacy and numeracy
    Given Emma is building reading and math skills
    And she can handle more complexity than younger children
    When Emma uses the Value Scanner interface
    Then text should be at appropriate reading level for ages 8-10
    And comparison tools should support decision-making
    And basic math support should help with calculating savings
    And visual aids should supplement text
    And the interface should feel helpful, not game-like
    And design should support skill development without frustration
