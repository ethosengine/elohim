Feature: Municipal Layer Value Recognition for Teen
  As a teen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the municipal governance layer
  I want to engage with public systems and local policy as a constitutional participant
  So that I learn civic engagement and my generation's voice shapes systems for collective flourishing

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teen user "Jasmine" is registered in the system
    And Jasmine is 16 years old
    And she lives in the municipality of Riverside
    And the municipal governance context is active
    And the municipal_elohim coordinates city-wide care economy patterns
    And Jasmine has substantial care contributions across multiple contexts

  Scenario: Teen's care contributions give standing in municipal conversations
    Given Jasmine has accumulated significant care economy participation
    And she contributes household labor, paid work, volunteering, and civic engagement
    When municipal discussions about youth policy occur
    Then her care contributions should give her legitimate standing
    And municipal_elohim should recognize her as a constitutional participant
    And she should not be dismissed due to age
    And her voice should carry weight based on demonstrated contribution
    And the municipality should recognize teens as current participants, not future constituents
    And youth civic engagement should be valued as care work for democratic governance

  Scenario: Municipal youth advisory board includes teen care economy participants
    Given the municipality is establishing youth civic engagement structures
    And Jasmine has demonstrated leadership through care contributions
    When the municipal_elohim identifies candidates for youth advisory board
    Then Jasmine should be surfaced as a potential participant
    And her care economy track record should demonstrate her capability
    And selection should be based on demonstrated contribution, not just academic achievement
    And diverse youth voices should be included in municipal governance
    And teens should participate in decisions that affect their lives
    And youth advisory structures should have real power, not just token representation

  Scenario: Teen learns how local policy affects daily life
    Given Jasmine participates in municipal care economy
    And local policies shape her lived experience
    When she engages with municipal systems through the Value Scanner
    Then the municipal_elohim should make policy connections visible
    And explain how local food policy affects her grocery shopping
    And show how zoning decisions impact neighborhood walkability
    And connect transit policy to her ability to access work and school
    And help her understand that municipal governance is not abstract
    And build her civic literacy through connection to daily experience

  Scenario: Municipal data about teen contributions informs youth policy
    Given thousands of teens participate in care economy across the municipality
    And their contributions generate aggregate data about youth participation
    When municipal_elohim analyzes youth care economy patterns
    Then it should surface insights about teen contributions to city wellbeing
    And show that youth provide substantial unpaid household labor
    And demonstrate economic value of youth volunteering and community engagement
    And inform municipal policy about youth employment and education
    And shift public understanding from "youth as problems" to "youth as contributors"
    And support evidence-based youth policy grounded in actual participation data

  Scenario: Teen participates in municipal sustainability initiatives
    Given the municipality has climate action and sustainability goals
    And Jasmine makes consumption choices reflecting environmental values
    When she participates in municipal environmental programs
    Then her ecological care work should be tracked and valued
    And municipal_elohim should aggregate youth environmental contributions
    And recognize that youth climate activism is care work for future generations
    And connect individual choices to municipal sustainability metrics
    And demonstrate that youth environmental leadership advances city goals
    And support her generation's investment in climate action

  Scenario: Municipal transit and urban planning responsive to teen needs
    Given Jasmine relies on public transit and walkable neighborhoods
    And urban planning decisions affect her daily mobility
    When the municipality makes transit and planning decisions
    Then youth input should be actively solicited through municipal_elohim
    And Jasmine's lived experience should inform planning
    And teen mobility needs should shape transit routing and scheduling
    And safe walking and biking infrastructure should reflect youth usage patterns
    And municipal planning should recognize teens as legitimate urban space users
    And age-friendly cities should include teen-friendly design

  Scenario: Municipal food policy informed by teen participation patterns
    Given Jasmine uses Value Scanner for food purchasing across the municipality
    And aggregate data shows youth food access patterns
    When municipal_elohim analyzes food security and access
    Then it should surface insights about how teens access food
    And identify food deserts affecting youth
    And show impact of local food policy on teen nutrition
    And inform municipal food policy with data about youth participation
    And support evidence-based policy for food security
    And recognize that teen food access matters to public health

  Scenario: Teen's worker rights protected through municipal care economy
    Given Jasmine works part-time in retail
    And municipal labor regulations apply to her employment
    When municipal_elohim monitors workplace conditions
    Then it should track whether young workers are fairly treated
    And flag systematic exploitation of teen labor
    And surface if employers violate youth labor laws
    And aggregate data about teen working conditions
    And inform municipal labor policy enforcement
    And protect young workers through care economy transparency

  Scenario: Municipal resources accessible to teen based on care contribution
    Given the municipality offers public services and resources
    And Jasmine has demonstrated substantial care economy participation
    When she seeks to access municipal programs
    Then her care contributions should qualify her for access
    And municipal_elohim should recognize her as a legitimate community member
    And she should access libraries, recreation facilities, and public programs independently
    And municipal services should be teen-accessible without parental mediation
    And public resources should serve all ages based on contribution and need
    And she should experience being a valued member of the city

  Scenario: Teen civic engagement shapes municipal budget priorities
    Given the municipality uses participatory budgeting processes
    And Jasmine has demonstrated civic engagement
    When municipal budget decisions are made
    Then youth voice should be included in budget priority conversations
    And Jasmine's care contributions should give her standing in budget discussions
    And municipal_elohim should facilitate youth participation in participatory budgeting
    And teen input should shape allocation of public resources
    And she should learn that civic participation means influencing resource decisions
    And democratic governance should include all age groups in budget processes

  Scenario: Municipal care economy data informs state and federal policy
    Given Riverside municipality has comprehensive care economy data
    And thousands of teens participate in tracked care contributions
    When state or federal policymakers study youth economics
    Then municipal_elohim should provide anonymized aggregate data
    And demonstrate economic value of teen care contributions at scale
    And inform policy about youth employment, education, and wellbeing
    And show that care economy framework reveals invisible youth labor
    And support evidence-based policy at higher governance levels
    And contribute to national conversation about youth participation in economy

  Scenario: Teen learns lifecycle of democratic participation
    Given Jasmine is years away from voting age
    And democratic participation extends beyond voting
    When she engages municipal governance through care economy
    Then she should learn that civic engagement is continuous practice
    And understand that democracy requires active participation, not just voting
    And develop relationships with municipal institutions
    And build civic skills through real participation in local governance
    And internalize that she has legitimate voice in shaping her city
    And grow into voting age already practiced in democratic engagement

  Scenario: Municipal emergency response includes teen care contributions
    Given the municipality experiences emergency situation (natural disaster, pandemic)
    And community resilience depends on care economy networks
    When emergency response is coordinated through municipal_elohim
    Then teen care contributions should be recognized and mobilized
    And Jasmine's capability should be matched to community needs
    And youth mutual aid networks should be integrated into response
    And teen volunteers should be valued as essential emergency workers
    And care economy should demonstrate that communities survive crises through mutual care
    And her generation should learn that civic responsibility includes crisis response
