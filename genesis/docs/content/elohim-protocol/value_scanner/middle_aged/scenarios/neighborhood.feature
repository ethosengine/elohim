Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult
  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to participate in neighborhood care economy and mutual support
  So that I build local resilience, share resources, and strengthen community ties

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the middle-aged user "Robert" is registered in the system
    And Robert is 52 years old living in established suburban neighborhood
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy
    And the neighborhood has mix of young families, middle-aged adults, and elderly residents

  Scenario: Neighborhood care exchange coordinates mutual support
    Given Robert has skills and resources to share
    And he also needs support managing his care demands
    And neighbors have complementary needs and capacities
    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates care exchange
    Then it should match Robert's capacities with neighborhood needs
    And connect him to neighbors who can provide support
    And recognize his contributions: lawn care help for elderly neighbor, professional mentoring
    And surface opportunities: "Maria can provide backup childcare when your grandchild visits"
    And build reciprocal relationships based on mutual care
    And demonstrate that neighborhood functions through care exchange
    And strengthen local social capital

  Scenario: Elder care support shared across neighborhood
    Given Robert's parents visit regularly and will eventually need local care
    And several neighbors are also managing elder care
    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates elder care support
    Then it should connect neighbors managing similar challenges
    And facilitate sharing of resources, knowledge, and respite
    And surface: "Three neighbors use the same home health agency—could coordinate for better rates"
    And build neighborhood capacity to support aging residents
    And prevent isolation for those managing elder care
    And create mutual support network for common challenges
    And strengthen neighborhood through shared caregiving

  Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces costs and builds connection
    Given Robert has tools, equipment, and skills
    And buying everything individually is expensive and wasteful
    And neighbors have resources that Robert occasionally needs
    When neighborhood_elohim facilitates resource sharing
    Then it should coordinate tool libraries, equipment sharing, and skill exchange
    And track contributions: "Robert has lent tools 12 times, borrowed 8 times"
    And reduce household expenses through sharing
    And build relationships through resource exchange
    And demonstrate care economy principles at neighborhood scale
    And reduce consumption through sharing economy
    And strengthen neighborhood bonds through mutual support

  Scenario: Neighborhood emergency preparedness builds resilience
    Given emergencies and crises happen
    And neighborhoods with strong connections respond better to crisis
    And Robert has professional skills useful in emergencies
    When neighborhood_elohim supports emergency preparedness
    Then it should coordinate neighborhood emergency planning
    And map neighborhood skills and resources
    And recognize Robert's management and coordination capabilities
    And connect neighbors who can support each other in crisis
    And build neighborhood resilience through known relationships
    And ensure isolated residents are included in emergency networks
    And demonstrate that care economy creates crisis resilience

  Scenario: Neighborhood collective action on shared concerns
    Given neighborhood faces shared challenges
    And individual action is less effective than collective action
    And Robert has leadership capacity from professional experience
    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates collective action
    Then it should facilitate neighborhood organizing around shared concerns
    And recognize Robert's leadership capabilities
    And help coordinate neighborhood improvement projects
    And surface opportunities for collective action
    And build neighborhood governance capacity
    And demonstrate that care for place is part of care economy
    And strengthen neighborhood through collaborative problem-solving

  Scenario: Neighborhood care economy includes middle-aged leadership
    Given Robert has decades of life experience
    And he has accumulated professional and personal capabilities
    And he's positioned to contribute neighborhood leadership
    When neighborhood_elohim recognizes his leadership potential
    Then it should surface leadership opportunities appropriate to his capacity
    And connect him to neighborhood governance roles
    And recognize his care contributions as qualifying him for leadership
    And help him balance leadership with his existing demands
    And prevent overcommitment that would overwhelm him
    And channel his capabilities toward neighborhood improvement
    And build neighborhood leadership from accumulated care experience

  Scenario: Neighborhood time bank values all contributions equitably
    Given Robert contributes professional skills and labor
    And neighbors contribute different skills and capacities
    And all contributions have value in care economy
    When neighborhood_elohim manages time bank
    Then it should value Robert's professional mentoring and manual labor equally
    And recognize all neighborhood contributions as care work
    And prevent hierarchy where professional skills are valued more than care labor
    And build neighborhood equity through time bank reciprocity
    And demonstrate care economy principles in practice
    And strengthen neighborhood through mutual recognition
    And create alternative economy based on care rather than market

  Scenario: Neighborhood supports work-life balance for middle-aged adults
    Given Robert manages intense work and care demands
    And neighborhood support could ease his burden
    And he can also provide flexibility support to neighbors
    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates flexible support
    Then it should connect neighbors who can provide backup care
    And help Robert find local support for care emergencies
    And recognize his contributions when he helps neighbors
    And build mutual support networks for managing work-life balance
    And reduce isolation of managing demands alone
    And demonstrate that neighborhoods can support balanced lives
    And strengthen community through practical mutual aid

  Scenario: Neighborhood children and elders connected across generations
    Given Robert's grandchild occasionally visits
    And neighborhood has elderly residents and young families
    And intergenerational connection benefits everyone
    When neighborhood_elohim facilitates intergenerational connection
    Then it should coordinate intergenerational activities
    And connect Robert's visiting grandchild with neighborhood children
    And facilitate connections between neighborhood elders and families
    And build multigenerational neighborhood care networks
    And reduce isolation for elderly residents
    And provide care and enrichment for children
    And demonstrate that neighborhoods thrive through age diversity
    And strengthen community through intergenerational care

  Scenario: Neighborhood care tokens recognize local contributions
    Given Robert contributes to neighborhood care economy
    And his contributions strengthen neighborhood for everyone
    When neighborhood_elohim tracks care tokens
    Then it should recognize his neighborhood care contributions
    And value his help for elderly neighbors, resource sharing, and leadership
    And accumulate tokens that reflect his neighborhood care work
    And connect tokens to neighborhood governance voice
    And demonstrate that care contributions create social capital
    And recognize that neighborhood care is genuine economic contribution
    And build neighborhood through reciprocal care recognition

  Scenario: Neighborhood inclusion ensures isolated residents are connected
    Given some neighbors are isolated due to age, disability, or circumstance
    And Robert has capacity to reach out
    And neighborhood care economy should include everyone
    When neighborhood_elohim identifies isolated residents
    Then it should surface opportunities to connect with isolated neighbors
    And help Robert offer appropriate support
    And recognize his outreach as valuable care contribution
    And build inclusive neighborhood where no one is invisible
    And prevent isolation that harms individual and neighborhood wellbeing
    And demonstrate that care economy includes intentional inclusion
    And strengthen neighborhood by ensuring everyone belongs

  Scenario: Neighborhood boundaries prevent over-commitment
    Given Robert has limited capacity amid other demands
    And neighborhood participation could expand indefinitely
    And sustainable participation requires boundaries
    When neighborhood_elohim monitors Robert's neighborhood engagement
    Then it should recognize when neighborhood demands exceed his capacity
    And help him set healthy boundaries on neighborhood participation
    And surface when he's taking on too much neighborhood responsibility
    And support him in saying no to additional commitments
    And ensure neighborhood participation enhances rather than depletes him
    And protect him from burnout through over-commitment
    And help him maintain sustainable neighborhood engagement
