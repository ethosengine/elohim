Feature: Community Care Economy Participation for Workers
  As a worker serving community through my labor
  I need to participate in community care economy as both contributor and recipient
  So that I receive recognition and support proportional to my care contributions

  Background:
    Given I am a worker providing care labor to community
    And my restaurant work feeds hundreds of people
    And the community operates a care economy system
    And my labor accumulates care tokens reflecting contribution

  Scenario: Recognizing paid work as community care contribution
    Given I work 50+ hours per week preparing food for people
    And my labor serves community nourishment and flourishing
    When the community assesses care contributions
    Then the protocol should recognize my work as care labor
    And accumulate care tokens reflecting my service to community
    And make visible that all work serving others is care economy participation
    And reframe employment from pure extraction to community contribution

  Scenario: Accessing community resources based on care contributions
    Given I contribute significantly to community through my labor
    And community has food banks, meal programs, and mutual aid resources
    When I need support due to low wages or difficult circumstances
    Then the protocol should connect me to community resources
    And help me access support with dignity (not charity but reciprocity)
    And recognize that I have standing based on my care contributions
    And facilitate care economy where workers are supported by the community they serve

  Scenario: Participating in community food systems
    Given I work in food preparation and understand food systems
    And community has food co-ops, gardens, or alternative food access
    When I participate in community food initiatives
    Then the protocol should recognize my expertise and contribution
    And help me access affordable, quality food through community systems
    And accumulate care tokens for food systems participation
    And support building community food sovereignty

  Scenario: Connecting with community mutual aid networks
    Given workers need mutual aid during economic precarity
    And community has mutual aid organizing
    When I participate in mutual aid networks
    Then the protocol should connect me to appropriate networks
    And facilitate giving and receiving support
    And recognize that mutual aid is care economy practice
    And support building community resilience beyond market systems

  Scenario: Advocating for community support of workers
    Given workers are systematically underpaid and overworked
    When I want to advocate for community support of workers
    Then the protocol should help me organize advocacy
    And connect me with other workers for collective action
    And support pushing for living wage campaigns and worker protections
    And build community culture that values worker dignity

  Scenario: Contributing to community education about care work
    Given many people don't recognize labor as care contribution
    When I want to help community understand care economy
    Then the protocol should help me share my perspective as a worker
    And support education about care work embedded in all labor
    And facilitate community consciousness-raising
    And build movement toward care-economy-aligned economics

  Scenario: Accessing community healthcare and support services
    Given my low wages make healthcare and services unaffordable
    And community provides sliding-scale or care-economy-based services
    When I need healthcare, mental health support, or other services
    Then the protocol should connect me to accessible community resources
    And facilitate payment based on my care economy participation
    And recognize that workers deserve healthcare regardless of income
    And support building community care infrastructure

  Scenario: Participating in community governance despite time constraints
    Given community makes decisions affecting workers' lives
    And my work schedule limits participation in governance
    When the community needs worker perspectives in decision-making
    Then the protocol should help me participate when possible
    And amplify worker voices in community governance
    And advocate for accessible participation structures for workers
    And ensure community decisions account for workers' needs

  Scenario: Building community solidarity with other workers
    Given workers across community face similar exploitation
    When we want to organize collective support and advocacy
    Then the protocol should connect workers across industries
    And facilitate worker mutual aid and solidarity networks
    And support collective action for better conditions
    And build worker power through community organization

  Scenario: Accessing community crisis support during emergencies
    Given workers often lack economic buffers for emergencies
    When I experience health crisis, job loss, or other emergency
    Then the protocol should rapidly connect me to community crisis support
    And facilitate emergency mutual aid based on my care contributions
    And provide immediate practical support during crisis
    And ensure community safety net catches workers in need

  Scenario: Contributing care tokens to community initiatives
    Given I accumulate care tokens through my work and participation
    And community initiatives need resource pooling
    When I want to support community projects or people in need
    Then the protocol should enable me to contribute care tokens
    And facilitate care economy resource distribution
    And recognize that even workers with limited money can contribute meaningfully
    And build community care economy beyond cash transactions

  Scenario: Making visible that workers enable community flourishing
    Given community depends on workers' labor for functioning
    And workers are often invisible or undervalued
    When the community assesses what makes life possible
    Then the protocol should make visible workers' essential contributions
    And demonstrate that workers deserve dignity and fair compensation
    And build community consciousness about care labor embedded in all work
    And catalyze community support for worker justice and care economy principles
