Feature: State Policy and Accountability Journalism for Journalist
  As a journalist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer
  I want to connect state policy to local impacts
  So that policy journalism serves communities not just political insiders

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the journalist user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active

  Scenario: Journalist monitors multiple state agencies despite limited capacity
    Given the journalist covers state government
    And must track legislature, education department, environmental agency, and 8 others
    When the Observer monitors all state agencies and legislative committees
    Then the journalist reviews all consequential meetings and decisions
    And receives alerts for newsworthy developments
    And tracks legislation through committee process automatically
    And comprehensive state surveillance becomes sustainable
    And important policy changes don't escape coverage

  Scenario: Journalist grounds state education policy in local school impacts
    Given state legislature debates education funding formula
    And the journalist covers state education policy
    When the Observer shows local impacts across specific districts
    Then the journalist sees how formula change affects 230 individual schools
    And identifies which communities gain or lose funding
    And contacts affected teachers, parents, and students in specific districts
    And publishes story connecting state policy to lived local experiences
    And policy journalism serves communities not just political class

  Scenario: Journalist exposes lobbying influence on environmental regulation
    Given state considers weakening pollution regulations
    And the journalist investigates who benefits
    When the Observer tracks lobbying activity and legislative relationships
    Then the journalist sees industry lobbying expenditures of $4M
    And documents campaign contributions to committee members
    And identifies revolving door between industry and regulatory agency
    And shows pattern of weakened enforcement benefiting donors
    And publishes investigation exposing regulatory capture

  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks governor's claims on economic record
    Given the governor campaigns on economic success claims
    And the journalist provides accountability coverage
    When the Observer analyzes state economic data
    Then the journalist verifies job growth claim (accurate but misleading framing)
    And finds wage growth lags behind neighboring states
    And shows poverty rate increased despite jobs claim
    And identifies tax cut benefits concentrated in top income bracket
    And publishes fact-check grounding rhetoric in evidence

  Scenario: Journalist tracks state promises on infrastructure investment
    Given state announced major infrastructure funding 2 years ago
    And the journalist covered initial announcement
    When the Observer alerts on promise implementation timeline
    Then the journalist investigates actual spending and project completion
    And finds only 18% of promised funding has been allocated
    And sees projects concentrated in politically connected districts
    And documents communities still waiting for promised improvements
    And publishes accountability story on broken infrastructure commitments

  Scenario: Journalist investigates state criminal justice disparities
    Given the journalist covers criminal justice policy
    And data suggests racial disparities in enforcement
    When the Observer analyzes statewide criminal justice data
    Then the journalist sees Black residents arrested at 4x rate for same offenses
    And documents sentencing disparities for similar crimes
    And tracks outcomes showing selective enforcement patterns
    And identifies counties with extreme disparities
    And publishes investigation exposing systemic racism
    And pattern recognition reveals injustice at scale

  Scenario: Journalist collaborates with local reporters on state policy impacts
    Given state budget cuts affect services across all communities
    And the journalist coordinates with local reporters statewide
    When the Observer provides shared state surveillance infrastructure
    Then all journalists access same comprehensive state policy data
    And local reporters show impacts in their specific communities
    And state reporter synthesizes statewide pattern
    And collaborative investigation publishes simultaneously across outlets
    And state policy accountability serves whole state not just capital

  Scenario: Journalist develops whistleblower source in state agency
    Given a state employee witnesses fraud in contract process
    And fears career retaliation for exposing misconduct
    When the Observer provides secure protected channel
    Then the whistleblower shares evidence of fraudulent contracts
    And journalist investigates without exposing source
    And verifies claims through additional reporting and records
    And publishes investigation leading to official inquiry
    And source protection enables accountability journalism
