Feature: Education Accountability Journalism for Journalist
  As a journalist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want comprehensive education governance surveillance
  So that education journalism holds systems accountable for equity

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the journalist user is registered in the system
    And the educational governance context is active

  Scenario: Journalist monitors multiple school districts despite limited capacity
    Given the journalist covers regional education
    And must track 8 school districts plus state education department
    When the Observer monitors all district school boards simultaneously
    Then the journalist reviews all board meetings across districts
    And receives alerts for newsworthy decisions and patterns
    And identifies stories affecting multiple districts
    And comprehensive regional education coverage becomes sustainable
    And no consequential education decision escapes scrutiny

  Scenario: Journalist exposes systematic school resource inequities
    Given the journalist investigates education equity
    And suspects under-resourcing of schools serving students of color
    When the Observer analyzes district resource distribution
    Then the journalist sees experienced teachers concentrate in white affluent schools
    And documents gifted programs and AP courses cluster by race and class
    And finds per-student spending disparities of thousands of dollars
    And shows facility quality varies dramatically by neighborhood
    And publishes investigation exposing structural educational racism

  Scenario: Journalist tracks school board member voting patterns
    Given a board member campaigns on equity platform
    And the journalist investigates whether actions match rhetoric
    When the Observer analyzes 3 years of board voting records
    Then the journalist sees board member voted against equity funding 7 times
    And approved budget cutting programs serving disadvantaged students
    And voted for charter expansion draining district resources
    And identifies pattern of rhetoric contradicting voting record
    And publishes accountability profile exposing hypocrisy

  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks superintendent claims on achievement
    Given the superintendent presents glowing achievement data
    And the journalist provides accountability coverage
    When the Observer analyzes district outcome data
    Then the journalist verifies overall test score increase (true)
    And finds achievement gap between white and Black students widened
    And shows gains concentrated in already-high-performing schools
    And identifies selective data presentation masking inequity
    And publishes fact-check revealing hidden disparities

  Scenario: Journalist investigates school discipline disparities
    Given parents report Black students face harsher discipline
    And the journalist investigates discipline practices
    When the Observer analyzes discipline data by race
    Then the journalist sees Black students suspended at 3.5x rate
    And documents same behaviors leading to suspension for Black students, warnings for white
    And tracks individual administrators with extreme disparity patterns
    And compares to districts using restorative justice successfully
    And publishes investigation exposing discriminatory discipline
    And pattern recognition reveals school-to-prison pipeline

  Scenario: Journalist tracks district promises on equity initiatives
    Given district announced equity plan with specific commitments
    And the journalist covered initial announcement 18 months ago
    When the Observer monitors equity plan implementation
    Then the journalist finds only 2 of 12 commitments implemented
    And sees budget that was supposed to fund initiatives redirected
    And identifies resistance from administrators in board meeting discussions
    And documents continued inequities despite equity rhetoric
    And publishes accountability story on broken equity promises

  Scenario: Journalist develops teacher sources on unsafe conditions
    Given teachers report unsafe building conditions
    And fear retaliation for speaking publicly
    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel
    Then teachers share evidence of mold, failing HVAC, and structural issues
    And journalist investigates without exposing individual sources
    And verifies claims through building inspection records
    And documents district knowledge and inaction
    And publishes investigation forcing accountability
    And source protection enables teachers to speak truth

  Scenario: Journalist investigates charter school performance claims
    Given charter schools claim superior outcomes for disadvantaged students
    And receive public funding based on performance claims
    When the Observer analyzes charter outcomes versus district schools
    Then the journalist sees charters are more racially segregated
    And finds test gains disappear when controlling for selective enrollment
    And documents higher suspension rates for students of color
    And shows charter expansion drains resources from district
    And publishes investigation questioning charter expansion policy
