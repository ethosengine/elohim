Feature: Environmental Accountability Journalism for Journalist
  As a journalist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the ecological governance layer
  I want comprehensive environmental surveillance across jurisdictions
  So that environmental journalism exposes pollution and holds power accountable

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the journalist user is registered in the system
    And the ecological governance context is active

  Scenario: Journalist monitors environmental permits across multiple agencies
    Given the journalist covers regional environmental issues
    And must track city, county, state, and federal environmental agencies
    When the Observer monitors all environmental agencies simultaneously
    Then the journalist reviews all permit applications and approvals
    And receives alerts for controversial permits and violations
    And tracks cumulative environmental impacts across jurisdictions
    And comprehensive environmental surveillance becomes sustainable
    And polluters cannot hide in bureaucratic complexity

  Scenario: Journalist exposes environmental racism through pattern recognition
    Given pollution facilities cluster in certain communities
    And the journalist investigates environmental justice
    When the Observer analyzes environmental permit patterns
    Then the journalist sees industrial permits concentrate in communities of color
    And maps proximity of pollution sources to schools and residences
    And documents health outcome disparities by neighborhood demographics
    And shows pattern persists across decades of permitting decisions
    And publishes investigation exposing systematic environmental racism

  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks industry claims on pollution reduction
    Given a corporation claims environmental leadership
    And the journalist investigates actual environmental record
    When the Observer analyzes company's violations and emissions
    Then the journalist finds 23 violations in past 5 years
    And verifies emissions increased despite efficiency claims
    And shows company lobbied against stronger pollution regulations
    And identifies millions in fines that were never paid
    And publishes investigation exposing greenwashing

  Scenario: Journalist investigates regulatory capture of environmental agency
    Given environmental regulations are weakly enforced
    And the journalist suspects industry influence over regulators
    When the Observer tracks regulatory agency decisions and relationships
    Then the journalist sees violation fines reduced 78% in 3 years
    And documents revolving door between industry and agency leadership
    And identifies campaign contributions from regulated industries
    And shows pattern of violations detected but not penalized
    And publishes investigation exposing regulatory capture

  Scenario: Journalist tracks climate commitments to accountability
    Given city and state announced climate action plans
    And the journalist covered initial announcements
    When the Observer monitors climate policy implementation
    Then the journalist finds emissions reduction targets are not being met
    And sees policies that would reduce emissions remain unimplemented
    And identifies budget cuts to climate programs despite commitments
    And documents gap between climate rhetoric and action
    And publishes accountability story on broken climate promises

  Scenario: Journalist detects pollution pattern across watershed
    Given the journalist investigates water quality concerns
    And pollution affects communities across watershed
    When the Observer tracks environmental data across jurisdictions
    Then the journalist sees contamination pattern from industrial facility upstream
    And maps affected communities downstream across state lines
    And documents regulatory agencies failing to coordinate enforcement
    And shows company violated permits in multiple states
    And publishes regional investigation forcing coordinated response

  Scenario: Journalist develops whistleblower source on environmental violations
    Given an employee witnesses company illegally dumping waste
    And fears job loss for reporting violations
    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel
    Then the whistleblower shares evidence of illegal dumping
    And journalist investigates without exposing source
    And verifies claims through regulatory records and site investigation
    And publishes investigation leading to enforcement action
    And source protection enables environmental accountability

  Scenario: Journalist investigates developer environmental impact claims
    Given a major development project claims environmental sustainability
    And the journalist evaluates environmental impact claims
    When the Observer analyzes developer's environmental track record
    Then the journalist finds developer's past projects harmed ecosystems
    And verifies sustainability claims contradict actual development plans
    And identifies wetland destruction despite mitigation promises
    And shows developer has outstanding violations in other states
    And publishes investigation challenging project approval
    And instant research exposes developer deception
