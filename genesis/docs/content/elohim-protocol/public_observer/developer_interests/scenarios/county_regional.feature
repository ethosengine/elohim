Feature: Regional Development Accountability for Developer Interests
  As a developer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the county_regional governance layer
  I want regional coordination and pattern transparency
  So that responsible regional development creates genuine value not extraction

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the developer_interests user is registered in the system
    And the county_regional governance context is active

  Scenario: Developer coordinates multi-jurisdictional project transparently
    Given a developer is planning development spanning three municipalities
    And wants to navigate regional coordination requirements
    When the Observer provides regional process navigation
    Then the developer sees: county planning requirements affect all three jurisdictions
    And identifies regional coordination bodies and approval pathways
    And understands environmental review at regional scale
    And accesses precedents for similar multi-jurisdictional projects
    And navigates complexity transparently not through manipulation

  Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates regional housing contribution
    Given a developer builds affordable housing across the region
    And wants regional approval bodies to recognize consistent track record
    When the Observer surfaces regional development patterns
    Then the developer shows: 600 affordable units built across five municipalities
    And demonstrates 85% occupancy by local workforce
    And proves commitment to regional affordability not just luxury development
    And regional reputation supports new project approvals
    And consistent value creation becomes visible at scale

  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for regional pattern of extraction
    Given a developer concentrates luxury developments in affluent areas
    And avoids affordable housing obligations through jurisdictional arbitrage
    When the Observer reveals regional development patterns
    Then planning bodies see: 12 luxury projects, zero affordable housing contribution
    And pattern shows developer plays municipalities against each other
    And uses weakest regulations to avoid affordable housing requirements
    And regional coordination can address jurisdictional arbitrage
    And systematic extraction becomes visible and challengeable

  Scenario: Developer receives honest regional impact analysis
    Given a developer claims project creates regional economic benefit
    But analysis omits regional infrastructure burden
    When the Observer provides regional cost-benefit assessment
    Then the developer sees: promised jobs mostly go to workers from outside region
    And traffic impacts affect three counties' transportation networks
    And environmental impacts span watershed affecting six municipalities
    And honest regional accounting reveals actual trade-offs
    And local extraction versus regional benefit becomes clear

  Scenario: Developer negotiates regional community benefits agreement
    Given a developer's project has significant regional impacts
    And multiple communities demand input and benefits
    When the Observer facilitates regional benefit negotiations
    Then the developer engages stakeholders from all affected jurisdictions
    And negotiates benefits addressing regional not just local impacts
    And commits to workforce development benefiting regional residents
    And Observer tracks delivery across jurisdictional boundaries
    And regional accountability prevents divide-and-conquer tactics

  Scenario: Developer track record follows across jurisdictions
    Given a developer broke promises in one municipality
    And now seeks approval in neighboring jurisdiction
    When the Observer provides cross-jurisdictional track record
    Then planning commission sees: developer promised 150 jobs, delivered 18
    And community benefits agreement was not honored
    And pattern shows developer moves to new jurisdiction after burning bridges
    And regional transparency prevents serial extraction
    And developers can't escape accountability through relocation

  Scenario: Responsible developer gains regional competitive advantage
    Given a responsible developer consistently delivers promised benefits
    And has positive track record across multiple jurisdictions
    When the Observer makes regional reputation visible
    Then the developer shows: projects in four counties all met commitments
    And community feedback is consistently positive
    And environmental standards were exceeded not just met
    And regional reputation creates access to better opportunities
    And integrity pays dividends across jurisdictional boundaries
