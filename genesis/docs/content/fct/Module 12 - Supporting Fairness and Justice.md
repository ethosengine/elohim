### Introduction

Justice as Active Participation in God's Kingdom  
In our digital age, the concept of justice takes on new dimensions, yet its core remains rooted in the timeless wisdom of Scripture. As we navigate the complex landscape of technology and its impact on society, we must remember that true justice is not merely an ideal to be discussed, but a reality to be lived and experienced.  
Justice, in its fullest sense, is the degree to which individuals can actively participate in and benefit from the values we hold dear in a democratic society. It's not enough to simply declare rights or espouse lofty principles; justice is realized when people have the genuine capability to exercise those rights and embody those principles in their daily lives. This understanding aligns closely with the "Capability Approach" developed by Professors Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen, which emphasizes that justice requires creating the conditions and capabilities necessary for individuals to truly flourish.  
This perspective resonates deeply with the teachings of Jesus and the broader biblical narrative. Throughout Scripture, we see a consistent emphasis on active faith \- a faith that is lived out in tangible actions rather than mere words. Consider Jesus' words in Matthew 7:16-20: "By their fruit you will recognize them... Every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit... Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them." This principle applies not only to individual believers but also to the systems and technologies we create.  
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus further emphasizes this point: "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven" (Matthew 7:21). This teaching challenges us to move beyond lip service and into active engagement with God's vision of justice and flourishing for all.  
The apostle James echoes this sentiment, declaring that "faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead" (James 2:17). In the context of our digital world, this calls us to examine how our technological creations and online behaviors either enable or hinder the realization of true justice.  
As we delve into this module, we will explore how these biblical principles can guide our approach to technology and digital spaces. We'll examine how we can move beyond simply talking about digital rights and fairness to actively creating systems and practices that empower individuals to fully participate in digital society. We'll consider how our online actions, the algorithms we design, and the platforms we build can bear good fruit \- fruit that nourishes a just and equitable digital world.  
This approach challenges us to think critically about the capabilities our technologies are fostering or hindering. Are we creating digital ecosystems that truly enable all individuals to realize their God-given potential? Are we designing systems that bear the fruit of justice, or are we inadvertently perpetuating inequalities and injustices?  
As we proceed, let us keep in mind the words of the prophet Micah: "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8). In our digital age, acting justly means actively working to create technologies and online spaces that empower all individuals to fully participate in society, to exercise their rights, and to realize their potential as bearers of God's image.  
Through this module, we will explore practical ways to embody these principles, moving from abstract ideals to concrete actions that bear the fruit of justice in our digital world. Let us approach this task with humility, creativity, and a steadfast commitment to doing the will of our Father, recognizing that in this work, we participate in the unfolding of God's kingdom \- a kingdom where justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream (Amos 5:24).

### Bible Reference(s)

#### "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God." (Micah 6:8)  Matthew 12:46-50 For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”  Matthew 15:8 “These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.”.    Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. Ephesians 4:29  Matthew 23:3-4:  " So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. 4 They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.  Matthew 6:1-2 (A Caution) “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. 2 “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.  So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” Acts 10:34‭-‬36‭, ‬43 ESV    **Fill My House: A Divine Imperative for Inclusive Technology**

### Story 

The Path to Justice: Lessons from Post-War Germany  
In the aftermath of World War II, amidst the rubble of defeated Germany, an extraordinary experiment in justice and human dignity began to unfold. This story serves as a powerful reminder that justice is not an abstract concept, but a living reality shaped by our collective choices and actions.  
As the Allied powers worked to rebuild Germany, they faced a monumental challenge: how to create a system that would prevent the horrors of Nazism from ever recurring while still respecting the autonomy and dignity of the German people. The result of their efforts, the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) of 1949, became more than just a constitution—it was a blueprint for a just society that placed human dignity at its core.  
Article 1 of the Basic Law states, "Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority." This wasn't just a lofty ideal; it was a principle that permeated every aspect of the new German society. It influenced policies on healthcare, housing, education, and social welfare, creating a system that sought to ensure every citizen could live with dignity.  
The framers of the Basic Law understood that justice flows from how we choose to live together. They recognized that a just society requires more than just laws—it needs institutions and practices that embody those principles. For instance, they established a robust public broadcasting system, designed to provide citizens with diverse, factual information necessary for democratic participation. This decision reflected an understanding that an informed citizenry is crucial for justice to flourish.  
The Basic Law also enshrined the concept of the "social state" (Sozialstaat), committing Germany to provide for the basic needs of its citizens. This led to the development of a comprehensive healthcare system that treats access to medical care as a fundamental right, not a privilege. It's a living example of the biblical principle that true justice involves caring for the vulnerable and ensuring everyone can participate fully in society.  
Moreover, Germany's approach to criminal justice evolved to emphasize rehabilitation over punishment, reflecting a belief in the potential for human transformation—a deeply Christian concept. This merciful approach to justice has resulted in lower recidivism rates and a more humane prison system.  
The story of post-war Germany reminds us that justice is not something that simply happens. It's the result of intentional choices, of people coming together and deciding to create a society that values every human life. It's about building systems and institutions that don't just pay lip service to human dignity but actively work to uphold it.  
As we consider our digital age, we can draw important lessons from this historical example. Just as the framers of Germany's Basic Law had to reimagine society in the wake of catastrophe, we too are called to reimagine our digital world. How can we design our online spaces, our algorithms, our digital institutions to uphold human dignity? How can we ensure that our technological choices lead to greater justice, not less?  
The story of post-war Germany shows us that it's possible to build systems that enshrine human dignity and promote justice, even in the face of great challenges. It reminds us that our choices matter—that the systems we build and the way we choose to live within them can create a more just world.  
As Christians engaged in technology, we are called to this work of justice. Like the framers of the Basic Law, we must look beyond quick fixes or surface-level solutions. We must consider how our choices in designing and using technology can create digital spaces and systems that truly uphold human dignity and enable all people to flourish.  
This is not easy work, but it is vital. As we navigate the complexities of our digital age, let us remember that true justice flows from how we choose to live—both online and offline. Let our technological choices be guided by the biblical mandate to "act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God" (Micah 6:8). In doing so, we participate in God's ongoing work of redemption, creating digital spaces that reflect His love and justice for all of humanity.

### Discussion Question or Activity

"Let's reflect on our daily lives. Consider your morning routine: the coffee you drink, the car you drive to work, the neighborhood you live in. Now think about the homeless person you passed on your way here. How do our lifestyle choices \- where we live, how we commute, what we consume \- contribute to the economic systems that lead to homelessness? In what ways might our feelings of generosity when we donate to church programs actually insulate us from confronting the real impact of our daily decisions? How can we move beyond 'feeling good' about occasional charity to make choices that promote justice in our everyday lives?"  
This question aims to:

Ground the discussion in familiar, everyday experiences (morning routines, commutes, consumer choices).  
Directly link personal lifestyle choices to broader systemic issues like homelessness.  
Challenge the notion that church donations alone are sufficient to address injustice.  
Encourage critical self-reflection on how our comfortable lifestyles might perpetuate injustice.  
Prompt consideration of how 'feeling good' about charity can sometimes prevent deeper engagement with issues of justice.  
Invite participants to think about concrete ways they can promote justice through their daily choices, not just through church activities.  
Emphasize personal responsibility within systemic injustice, moving away from an 'us vs. them' mentality.

This framing should help participants see themselves as active participants in systems of injustice or justice, rather than passive observers or occasional charitable givers. It challenges them to consider how their everyday choices, not just their church involvement, impact issues of justice in their community.

### Conclusion

Embodying Digital and Lived Justice in God's Kingdom  
As we conclude this module, we find ourselves at the intersection of digital ethics, biblical teaching, and lived reality. We began by exploring the Center for Humane Technology's perspective on justice and fairness in the digital realm, understanding that true justice is not merely about declaring rights, but about creating systems that enable people to fully express their capabilities. This aligns powerfully with the biblical conception of justice as active participation in God's will.  
Jesus consistently emphasized that faith without action is hollow. "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven" (Matthew 7:21). This calls us to move beyond mere digital activism or occasional charitable giving to a lifestyle that consistently embodies God's justice.  
We looked at how post-war Germany's Basic Law enshrined human dignity and social responsibility into the very fabric of their society. This serves as a powerful example of how intentional choices in designing systems – whether legal, social, or digital – can promote justice and human flourishing. As Christians in the digital age, we are called to be equally intentional in how we design and interact with technology, ensuring it upholds human dignity and promotes justice.  
However, our exploration didn't stop at the digital realm or system design. We confronted the uncomfortable truth that our everyday lifestyle choices – where we live, what we consume, how we spend our money – have profound implications for justice in our communities and beyond. We recognized that feeling good about our charitable giving or church programs can sometimes insulate us from confronting the real impact of our daily decisions.  
The challenge before us is significant. It calls for a radical reevaluation of our priorities, a willingness to live below our means, and a commitment to make choices that promote justice, even when they're inconvenient or costly to us personally. This might mean choosing public transportation over a private car, advocating for inclusive zoning in our neighborhoods, or consciously consuming less to free up resources for those in need.  
As we move forward, let us remember that in God's kingdom, justice is not an abstract concept but a lived reality. It's expressed not just in our online behavior or our church attendance, but in every choice we make. Our call is to be do-ers of justice, actively working to create a world where all people can thrive, both online and offline.  
This journey towards embodied justice will not be easy. It will require constant self-reflection, a willingness to confront our own complicity in unjust systems, and the courage to make counter-cultural choices. But as we step out in faith, making daily decisions that prioritize justice over comfort, we participate in God's ongoing work of redemption. We become living testimonies to the transformative power of the gospel, creating ripples of justice that extend far beyond our individual lives.  
May we go forth from this module with renewed commitment to be not just hearers, but doers of God's word. Let us design our digital spaces, shape our communities, and live our daily lives in ways that bear the good fruit of justice, trusting that as we do so, we are co-laborers with Christ in bringing about His kingdom "on earth as it is in heaven."
