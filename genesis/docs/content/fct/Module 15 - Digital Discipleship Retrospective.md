"Digital Discipleship Retrospective"  
Purpose: To reflect on our learning journey, identify key takeaways, and create action plans for implementing humane technology principles in our Christian walk and tech engagement.  
Format: This activity will follow a modified agile retrospective format, adapted for our Christian technology context.  
Time: 60-90 minutes  
Materials: Sticky notes (physical or digital), whiteboard or shared digital workspace  
Steps:

Opening Prayer (5 minutes)  
Begin with a prayer, inviting God's wisdom and guidance as we reflect and plan.  
Set the Stage (5 minutes)  
Briefly recap the course journey and explain the retrospective process.  
Gather Data (15 minutes)  
Prompt participants to write responses to these questions on sticky notes:

What key insights about faith and technology have you gained?  
Where have you seen God at work in your engagement with technology during this course?  
What challenges or areas of tension have you identified in aligning your tech use/development with your faith?

Generate Insights (20 minutes)  
In small groups, share and cluster the sticky notes, looking for patterns. Discuss:

How do these insights reflect our calling as "digital disciples"?  
Where do we see opportunities to be "salt and light" in the tech world?

Decide What to Do (20 minutes)  
Individually, then in pairs, create action plans addressing:

One immediate change you'll make in your personal tech habits  
One initiative you'll start or join in your church/community related to humane technology  
One way you'll advocate for more Christ-centered approaches in your professional tech engagement

Close the Retrospective (15 minutes)

Each person shares their top action item with the larger group  
Collectively, create a "Digital Discipleship Manifesto" – a short list of commitments the group is making to steward technology in a way that honors God and serves humanity

Closing Prayer (5 minutes)  
End with a prayer of commissioning, asking for God's strength and guidance as we go forth to act on our learnings.

Follow-up:  
Encourage participants to share their action plans with an accountability partner from the course. Schedule a follow-up session in 1-3 months to check in on progress and share stories of impact.  
This activity allows participants to synthesize their learning, connect it directly to their faith and daily lives, and create concrete plans for action. It embodies the "Ready to Act" theme while incorporating elements of reflection, community sharing, and forward-looking planning – all crucial components for turning learning into real-world impact.
