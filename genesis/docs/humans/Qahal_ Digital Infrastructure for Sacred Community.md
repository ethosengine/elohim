# Qahal: Digital Infrastructure for Sacred Community

\#\# Abstract

This whitepaper introduces Qahal (קהל), a framework for digital community infrastructure inspired by the Hebrew concept of sacred assembly and the Greek ekklesia. Based on Jesus's prayer for unity in John 17, Qahal provides technological patterns and structures that enable genuine community, mutual care, and collective flourishing. By integrating individual gifts and needs (via Imago Dei profiles) into coherent community struoctures, Qahal creates spaces where genuine reconciliation and mutual edification can flourish.

\#\# 1\. Introduction

Traditional digital platforms often reduce community to shallow interactions and transactional relationships. Qahal proposes a fundamentally different approach – one that recognizes community as a sacred space where genuine relationships, mutual support, and collective growth can flourish. Drawing on deep theological insights about human unity and divine-human partnership, Qahal provides infrastructure for meaningful community life in digital spaces.

\#\# 9\. Conclusion

Qahal represents a fundamental reimagining of digital community infrastructure. By providing patterns and structures that support genuine community life, it enables new forms of human flourishing and collective action. As we continue to develop and refine this framework, we invite collaboration from communities, technologists, and theologians to help realize its full potential for human flourishing.
