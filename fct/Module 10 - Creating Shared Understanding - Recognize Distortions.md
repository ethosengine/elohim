### Foundations of Christians and Technology Learning Objectives

Recognize and articulate how social media and digital technologies are shaping perceptions and potentially distorting reality within Christian communities and the broader society.  
Analyze the role of engagement-driven algorithms in creating distortions and relate this to biblical concepts of truth-seeking and discernment.  
Evaluate the national security implications of fragmented shared understanding from a Christian perspective of peace-making and social responsibility.  
Identify and explain the key distortions in social media (e.g., "engaging content," "moral outrage," "amplification," etc.) and relate them to relevant biblical teachings on communication, community, and love.  
Examine how these distortions may be affecting Christian discourse, both within churches and in the broader public sphere.  
Assess the impact of social media distortions on the church's mission to be a unified body of Christ and its witness to the world.  
Reflect on personal experiences with these distortions and consider how they align or conflict with one's Christian values and practices.  
Analyze the challenges these distortions pose to democratic processes from a Christian ethical standpoint.  
Explore the biblical concept of unity in diversity and how it relates to the increased polarization and tribalism seen in digital spaces.  
Discuss the erosion of cultural trust in light of Christian teachings on community, truthfulness, and bearing false witness.  
Develop a theologically grounded critique of how current digital platforms may be undermining shared understanding within and beyond Christian communities.  
Propose ways that Christians can be "salt and light" in digital spaces, fostering environments of trust, understanding, and reconciliation.

These learning objectives aim to help Christian students understand the technological and social dynamics at play while also encouraging them to engage with these issues from a faith-based perspective. The goal is to equip them to be discerning users of technology and potentially to become creators of more humane digital environments that better align with Christian values.

### Introduction

C.S.Lewis (Mere Christianity) "God can show Himself as He reall is only to real men. And that means not simply t omen who are individually good, but to men who are united together in a body, loving one another, helping one another, show Him to one another. For that is what God ment humanity to be like; like players in one band, or organs in one body. 

Let’s go back to a concept we explored earlier in the course: seeing ourselves and society itself not as fixed entities, but as processes that are continually changing.  
Currently, information technologies like social media are disproportionately influencing how society is changing. The race to extract human attention ends up distorting people and relationships in a myriad ways.  
We mentioned in Module 4 that social media creates distorted images of its users. These technological infrastructures are not neutral observers but rather poke and prod the user to engage in certain behaviors. But beyond the distorted image of the user from the perspective of the system, it is also true that users have a distorted image of one another.  
In fact, instead of social media being a true mirror and reflection of society, it is better thought of as a “funhouse” mirror. The distortions of ourselves and of others are the psycho-social externalities of the ad-revenue driven, engagement-maximizing business models of these platforms.   
Here are some of the most relevant examples of these distortions:

The "Engaging Content" Distrotion  
The "Moral Outrage" Distortion  
The "Ampification" Distortion  
The "Extreme Emotion" Distortion  
The "Microtargeting" Distortion  
The "Othering" Distortion  
The "Disloyalty" Distortion  
The "Information Flooding" Distortion  
The "Anti-Journalism" Distortion

### Bible Reference(s)

Christian Unity & Harmony has a dependency of Christian Humility 

God and Jesus rejoicing in the truth:

John 14:6 \- "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"  
1 Corinthians 13:6 \- "Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth."  
3 John 1:4 \- "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth."

Responsibility to not bear false witness:

Exodus 20:16 \- "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor." (One of the Ten Commandments)  
Proverbs 12:22 \- "Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are his delight."  
Colossians 3:9-10 \- "Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator."

Dangers of lies, slander, and misrepresentation:

Proverbs 6:16-19 \- "There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers."  
Psalm 101:5 \- "Whoever slanders his neighbor secretly I will destroy. Whoever has a haughty look and an arrogant heart I will not endure."  
James 3:5-6 \- "So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire\! And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness."  
Proverbs 26:28 \- "A lying tongue hates its victims, and a flattering mouth works ruin."  
Ephesians 4:25 \- "Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another."

These verses underscore the importance of truth, the joy found in truthfulness, and the serious spiritual and social consequences of falsehood, which are highly relevant to our current digital information landscape.

### Story 

Imagine a bustling digital marketplace of faith. Millions of Christians gather daily, seeking inspiration, connection, and spiritual nourishment. They share prayers, verses, and testimonies. They debate theology and celebrate miracles. This vibrant online community seems to embody the global, interconnected Body of Christ that we've long envisioned.  
But there's a sobering reality behind this facade.  
In 2019, a shocking investigation revealed that 19 out of the top 20 Christian Facebook pages weren't run by devout believers, earnest ministries, or even well-meaning if misguided prosperity preachers. Instead, these pages – reaching tens of millions of faithful followers – were operated by foreign click farms, primarily based in Kosovo and Macedonia.  
Let that sink in. The vast majority of "Christian" content engaging your family, friends, and fellow church members was created not to edify, but to exploit.  
These click farms recognized a lucrative opportunity in the faith community. They understood that Christians are often trusting, eager to engage with spiritual content, and quick to share messages that resonate with their beliefs. By generating and spreading content that appealed to Christian sensibilities – often with a healthy dose of political outrage – these operators could drive massive engagement, translating into substantial advertising revenue.  
The content itself ranged from benign inspirational quotes (often misattributed) to more insidious misinformation designed to stoke fear and division within the Christian community. Regardless of the specific message, the true purpose was always the same: to capture and monetize the attention of believers.  
This revelation should shake us to our core. As Christians, we're called to be people of truth, integrity, and discernment. Yet here we were, unwittingly promoting and spreading content created by those who saw our faith not as a transformative truth, but as a profitable demographic to be exploited.  
Moreover, this situation reveals how our genuine desire for spiritual connection and growth can be weaponized against us in the attention economy. Every share, every comment, every moment spent engaging with this fraudulent content not only lined the pockets of unscrupulous operators but also drowned out authentic Christian voices and ministries trying to make a real impact.  
The implications run deeper still. How many believers have had their understanding of Christianity subtly warped by this steady stream of algorithmically optimized pseudo-faith? How has this distorted the wider world's perception of what Christianity stands for? And how has this contributed to the polarization and tribalism we see both within the Church and in our broader society?  
As followers of Christ, we're called to be "wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16). This situation demands that we reclaim that wisdom, exercising critical discernment in our digital lives. We must recognize that our attention – our most precious resource – is being systematically extracted and exploited, often at the expense of our spiritual well-being and our witness to the world.  
This is not just about being more careful on social media. This is a call to radically reevaluate our relationship with digital platforms and to take an active role in shaping a more authentic, more humane online ecosystem. It's a challenge to create and cultivate digital spaces that truly reflect the values of our faith – spaces that prioritize truth, foster genuine community, and point towards Christ rather than clickbait.  
As we confront this reality, let's allow our righteous anger to fuel positive action. Let's commit to being more discerning consumers and more responsible sharers of content. Let's support authentic Christian voices and ministries in the digital space. And for those of us with the skills and influence to do so, let's lead the charge in creating technology that serves the genuine needs of the faith community rather than exploiting them.  
The integrity of our digital discipleship and the authenticity of our online witness hang in the balance. It's time to reclaim our attention, our platforms, and our very understanding of what it means to be the Church in the digital age.

### Discussion Question or Activity

Think of church "experiences" you have worked on, supported, or participated in. Where might they have contributed to or amplified any of these distortions?

What principles should guide our use of social media and other digital platforms?

### Conclusion

All these distortions have run rampant in society for over a decade, warping our perception of reality and challenging our ability to discern truth. Under these conditions, the unity of the Body of Christ is severely threatened. Today's dominant social media platforms, rather than supporting the nuanced conversations and diverse viewpoints that Christian community requires, instead carve the population into warring tribes.  
The most engaged and influential voices, including many Christians, often become the most extreme and reactionary, losing sight of Christ's call to be peacemakers (Matthew 5:9). Those who refuse to submit to the social media-augmented culture war are frequently shunned and isolated, ending up confused, angry, and disconnected from community \- a stark contrast to the biblical vision of unity in diversity (1 Corinthians 12:12-27).  
The integrity of our digital discipleship is at stake. As we've seen, even our faith can be weaponized against us in the attention economy. The shocking revelation that 19 out of the 20 top Christian Facebook pages were run by foreign click farms should serve as a wake-up call. Our genuine desire for spiritual connection and growth is being exploited, not just undermining our witness but potentially warping our very understanding of Christianity.  
If the church cannot figure out how to create the epistemic commons necessary for the body to be unified under the leadership and direction of Christ as the head, we cannot offer hope to bring truth to the world. We must first take the plank out of our own eye, focusing on how to form disciples and be a truthful and informed people in a post-truth society.  
The Christian community depends on mutual trust and love to function as the Body of Christ. Social media has brought us dangerously close to losing this trust within our church lives. When shared understanding shatters, the witness of the Church is severely compromised.  
However, as followers of Christ, we are called to be agents of reconciliation in this fragmented world (2 Corinthians 5:18-20). We have a unique opportunity \- indeed, a responsibility \- to lead in creating technology that fosters genuine connection and shared understanding. This reflects God's desire for unity among His people and in all of creation, as expressed in Jesus' prayer "that they may all be one" (John 17:21).  
As Christians engaged with technology, we must rise to this challenge. We are called to be "wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16), exercising critical discernment in our digital lives while also working to create spaces that truly reflect the values of our faith. We must reclaim our attention, our platforms, and our very understanding of what it means to be the Church in the digital age.  
Let us commit to being at the forefront of developing humane technology \- technology that honors the imago dei in every user, fosters genuine community, and works towards the unity that Christ desires for His Church. By leveraging our skills and influence, we can create platforms and practices that nurture empathy, promote truthful dialogue, and build bridges across divides.  
In doing so, we embody the reconciling love of Christ in the digital age. This is our call \- to be "salt and light" (Matthew 5:13-16) in the digital realm, preserving truth, illuminating paths to genuine understanding, and ultimately pointing towards the reconciliation and shared understanding found in God's coming Kingdom. Only by addressing these challenges within our own communities can we hope to offer a transformative witness to a world in desperate need of truth and unity.
