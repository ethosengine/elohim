Liberation from Ownership Burden for Small Business Owner\n  As a small_business_owner in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want liberation from crushing ownership burden with dignified exit\n  So that I achieve security without betraying workers or community\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Rosa owns Rosa's Auto Repair, struggling under ownership burden\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And EAE offers acquisition enabling dignified transition\n\n  Scenario: Owner achieves fair compensation for years of sweat equity\n    Given Rosa built business through 15 years of underpaid 60-hour weeks\n    And business is worth $200K but no ethical buyer exists\n    When EAE offers $180K acquisition\n    Then Rosa receives payment reflecting equipment value, customer base, and sweat equity\n    And payment comes from community investment pool, not worker exploitation\n    And Rosa can pay debts, fund retirement, achieve financial breathing room\n    And fair value is recognized without requiring community institution destruction\n\n  Scenario: Owner lifts crushing burden of sole responsibility\n    Given Rosa carries weight of three employees' livelihoods alone\n    And she cannot vacation, get sick, or take breaks without business crisis\n    When EAE acquisition completes\n    Then Rosa is freed from sole responsibility for business survival\n    And employees are protected and elevated to co-owners\n    And Rosa can exit completely or stay as transition steward\n    And crushing weight of individual ownership is distributed democratically\n    And workplace_elohim ensures transition protects all parties\n\n  Scenario: Owner preserves legacy through democratic conversion\n    Given Rosa built community institution over 15 years\n    And selling to corporate chain would destroy what she created\n    When Rosa chooses EAE conversion over extractive sale\n    Then her legacy becomes democratic institution serving neighborhood\n    And her trust relationships are institutionalized, not erased\n    And she becomes founder who chose community over individual wealth\n    And legacy is preserved beyond her personal involvement\n    And community honors her wisdom in transition choice\n\n  Scenario: Owner transitions identity from sole owner to community elder\n    Given Rosa's identity was tied to business ownership\n    And exit could mean loss of meaning and social isolation\n    When EAE offers transition support\n    Then Rosa receives counseling for identity transition\n    And Rosa explores new roles: advisor, retiree, community elder\n    And Rosa's expertise is valued through consulting compensation\n    And transition is honored as life stage, not failure\n    And Rosa discovers purpose beyond ownership burden\n\n  Scenario: Owner chooses transition steward role over complete exit\n    Given Rosa wants to support workers through conversion\n    And she has knowledge essential for smooth transition\n    When Rosa selects two-year transition steward option\n    Then Rosa earns $55K salary for coordination and knowledge transfer\n    And Rosa facilitates workers' growing governance capacity\n    And Rosa's role gradually decreases as workers gain capability\n    And after two years, Rosa exits gracefully or stays as equal participant\n    And workplace_elohim ensures steward role doesn't recreate hierarchy\n\n  Scenario: Owner experiences relief from impossible competitive pressures\n    Given Rosa cannot compete with corporate chains on price alone\n    And she faces slow death by competition or worker exploitation\n    When business converts to EAE network\n    Then competitive pressure eases through distributed ownership eliminating extraction\n    And network provides volume purchasing power Rosa never had\n    And democratic governance enables innovation chains cannot match\n    And Rosa experiences relief from impossible economic trap\n\n  Scenario: Owner receives emotional support for ownership loss grief\n    Given letting go of business is genuine grief and identity crisis\n    And capitalist culture offers no support for this transition\n    When EAE provides transition support\n    Then Rosa accesses peer support groups with other converted owners\n    And Rosa receives therapy for processing ownership loss\n    And Rosa's emotional reality is validated and supported\n    And transition support recognizes this as major life change requiring care\n\n  Scenario: Owner protects workers while achieving own security\n    Given Rosa could sell to buyer who would fire workers and cut quality\n    And she refuses to betray workers despite financial pressure\n    When EAE acquisition enables both worker protection and owner security\n    Then workers gain ownership, higher wages, and governance voice\n    And Rosa achieves financial security without worker exploitation\n    And false choice between owner security and worker dignity is resolved\n    And Rosa's ethical commitments are honored, not punished\n",
