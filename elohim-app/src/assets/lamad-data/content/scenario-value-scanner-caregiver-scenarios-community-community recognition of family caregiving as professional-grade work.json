  "content": "Scenario: Community recognition of family caregiving as professional-grade work\n    Given James provides skilled care equivalent to professional nursing\n    And his work is invisible because he cares for family\n    When the community_elohim evaluates caregiving contributions\n    Then James's care should be valued at professional rates\n    And community should recognize family caregiving as essential infrastructure\n    And care token accumulation should reflect professional-grade value\n    And invisibility of family care should be systematically addressed\n    And community care economy should make family caregiving visible\n",
