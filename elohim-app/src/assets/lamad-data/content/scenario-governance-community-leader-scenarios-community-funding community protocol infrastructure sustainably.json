  "content": "Scenario: Funding community protocol infrastructure sustainably\n    Given Riverside needs resources for community nodes and maintenance\n    And we are relatively poor community\n    When I cobble together funding from multiple sources\n    Then we allocate: municipal budget treating this as public infrastructure\n    And we create: community ownership cooperative with resident investment\n    And we apply: for state and federal grants\n    And we participate: in mutual aid with wealthier communities\n    And we ensure: community retains ownership\n    And we plan: for 10-year sustainability not just pilot\n    And public investment: supports democratic governance tools\n",
