Individual Liberation and Purpose for Manager\n  As a manager in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want liberation from extraction role and meaningful purpose\n  So that I serve rather than dominate, coordinate rather than control\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Marcus has transitioned from corporate manager to democratic coordinator\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And his role has fundamentally transformed from command to facilitation\n\n  Scenario: Manager receives liberation from moral injury of implementing exploitation\n    Given Marcus previously enforced corporate extraction policies\n    And he experienced stress from implementing exploitation he knew was harmful\n    When ChickenMax converts to EAE democratic ownership\n    Then Marcus is offered choice to transition or exit with dignified severance\n    And if he chooses to stay, his role shifts from enforcing extraction to facilitating coordination\n    And he no longer implements policies harming workers he knows\n    And his stress levels decrease measurably (lower cortisol, better sleep)\n    And workplace_elohim documents his transition from extraction to service\n\n  Scenario: Manager's expertise is valued without requiring worker subordination\n    Given Marcus has genuine operational expertise from years of experience\n    And corporate role required worker subordination to exercise that expertise\n    When Marcus transitions to democratic coordinator\n    Then his scheduling knowledge becomes proposals, not commands\n    And his operations expertise is valued through consultation, not authority\n    And workers request his input because it's helpful, not because it's mandated\n    And his compensation ($72K) reflects expertise without extraction premium\n    And his purpose comes from service, not domination\n\n  Scenario: Manager derives legitimacy from consent rather than hierarchical appointment\n    Given Marcus was previously appointed by corporate, not chosen by workers\n    And workers resented his authority as imposed\n    When democratic governance structures are established\n    Then Marcus's coordinator role requires ongoing worker consent\n    And workers evaluate his facilitation effectiveness quarterly\n    And workers can democratically recall him if he fails to serve collective interests\n    And his legitimacy is earned through effective service, not imposed through hierarchy\n    And workplace_elohim ensures fair evaluation process\n\n  Scenario: Manager unlearns corporate extraction training through supported transition\n    Given Marcus was trained by corporate to minimize labor costs and maximize productivity\n    And these extraction skills are actively harmful in democratic context\n    When he begins democratic coordinator role\n    Then he receives training in facilitation, mediation, and collaborative coordination\n    And workplace_elohim provides resources on horizontal organization practices\n    And other democratic coordinators mentor him through transition\n    And he unlearns surveillance instincts and command reflexes\n    And his skill evolution is documented and supported, not demanded instantly\n\n  Scenario: Manager experiences reduced antagonism through structural transformation\n    Given Marcus lived in constant tension between workers and corporate\n    And workers saw him as enemy implementing exploitation\n    When structure changes from extraction to democratic coordination\n    Then worker antagonism dissipates as he stops enforcing extraction\n    And conflicts become collaborative problem-solving, not power struggles\n    And DeShawn's questions become genuine inquiry, not veiled resistance\n    And Marcus experiences relief from structural antagonism\n    And his relationships with workers transform from adversarial to collaborative\n\n  Scenario: Manager's personal growth shifts from extraction efficiency to facilitation effectiveness\n    Given corporate measured Marcus's success by labor cost minimization\n    And his career growth meant managing more extraction at larger scale\n    When he transitions to democratic coordinator\n    Then his growth trajectory shifts to facilitation skill development\n    And he learns consensus-building, conflict mediation, transparent communication\n    And his expertise becomes transferable to human flourishing, not just profit extraction\n    And he can mentor new EAE acquisitions through democratic transition\n    And his skills serve life instead of serving only capital\n\n  Scenario: Manager accesses fair compensation without guilt of extraction\n    Given Marcus earned $65K as corporate manager implementing exploitation\n    And he knew he was paid partly for willingness to harm workers\n    When he becomes democratic coordinator earning $72K\n    Then his compensation reflects genuine coordination expertise\n    And workers democratically approved his salary as fair\n    And he earns more than under corporate while feeling morally justified\n    And he no longer carries guilt of being paid to extract from colleagues\n    And workplace_elohim ensures compensation transparency prevents exploitation\n\n  Scenario: Manager chooses to exit gracefully with dignity and support\n    Given Marcus decides democratic coordination isn't the right fit for him\n    And corporate would have fired him or demanded resignation\n    When he communicates his intention to exit\n    Then workers appreciate his honest self-assessment\n    And he receives six months severance with glowing reference\n    And workplace_elohim facilitates transition support and knowledge transfer\n    And he leaves with dignity and community gratitude for attempting transition\n    And exit support demonstrates democratic values in practice\n",
