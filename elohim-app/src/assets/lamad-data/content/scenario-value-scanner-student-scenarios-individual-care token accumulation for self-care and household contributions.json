  "content": "Scenario: Care token accumulation for self-care and household contributions\n    Given Kenji prepares nutritious meals for himself\n    And he manages his space, does laundry, and maintains basic self-care\n    When the Value Scanner tracks Kenji's individual care contributions\n    Then it should accumulate care tokens for self-care labor\n    And it should recognize that caring for himself is care economy work\n    And it should track his development of adult life skills\n    And self-maintenance should be valued, not invisible\n    And the system should make visible the work of sustaining himself\n    And Kenji should see that taking care of himself is productive\n",
