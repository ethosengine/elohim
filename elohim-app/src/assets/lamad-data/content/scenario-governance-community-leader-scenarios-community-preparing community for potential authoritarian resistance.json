  "content": "Scenario: Preparing community for potential authoritarian resistance\n    Given authoritarian threat to protocol might emerge\n    And I plan for protecting community sovereignty\n    When I establish contingency plans for resistance\n    Then we maintain: encrypted backups of community data\n    And we prepare: mesh networking for internet disruption\n    And we identify: sanctuary partners (university, churches)\n    And we plan: civil disobedience protocols if needed\n    And we retain: community fork option as last resort\n    And we hope: never to use these\n    And we know: community sovereignty matters more than protocol uniformity\n",
