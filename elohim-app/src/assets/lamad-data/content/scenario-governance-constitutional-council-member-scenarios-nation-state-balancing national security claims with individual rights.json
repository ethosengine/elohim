  "content": "Scenario: Balancing national security claims with individual rights\n    Given an appeal challenges agent decision justified by security concerns\n    And I must weigh existential threats against individual dignity\n    When we review the security-rights balance\n    Then we evaluate: if security claim was legitimate or pretext\n    And we examine: if less rights-violating alternatives existed\n    And we consider: transparency appropriate to security context\n    And we establish: constitutional limits on authority even under threat\n    And we prevent: security from becoming excuse for unchecked power\n    And we create: precedent for how democracy functions under danger\n    And we protect: both security and rights through wise judgment\n",
