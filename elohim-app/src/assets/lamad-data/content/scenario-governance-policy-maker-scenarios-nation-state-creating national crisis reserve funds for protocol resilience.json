  "content": "Scenario: Creating national crisis reserve funds for protocol resilience\n    Given crises may threaten protocol infrastructure\n    And rapid response funding is needed\n    When I establish emergency reserves\n    Then I fund: rapid scaling for refugee crises\n    And I support: attack response against corporate or authoritarian threats\n    And I provide: disaster recovery for damaged infrastructure\n    And reserves ensure: protocol survives shocks\n    And resilience: is built into national support\n    And democratic governance: can weather emergencies\n",
