  "content": "Scenario: National longitudinal study tracking 10-year outcomes\n    Given Elohim Protocol has been adopted nationally for a decade\n    And I am conducting comprehensive longitudinal evaluation\n    When I analyze decade-long trajectories across thousands of communities\n    Then I measure: sustained vs transient effects on wellbeing\n    And I track: whether initial trust gains persist or decay\n    And I examine: how children growing up with protocol differ from previous generation\n    And I analyze: whether protocol transforms civic culture over time\n    And I investigate: institutional evolution and adaptation patterns\n    And I assess: whether benefits compound or plateau over time\n    And My research captures: transformative effects that short-term studies miss\n",
