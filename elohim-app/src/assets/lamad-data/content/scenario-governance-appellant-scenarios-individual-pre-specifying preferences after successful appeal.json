  "content": "Scenario: Pre-specifying preferences after successful appeal\n    Given my appeal was resolved and I gained the right to set preferences\n    When I access my preference settings through the interface\n    Then I can specify alert preferences for future interventions\n    And I can set thresholds like \"family alert only after three-day pattern\"\n    And I can balance my privacy needs with care considerations\n    And The agent respects my preferences in future decisions\n    And I feel ownership over my own protection rather than being controlled\n",
