  "content": "Feature: Workplace Care Economy and Worker Advocacy\n  As a worker in an employment relationship\n  I need tools for understanding my rights and advocating for care-aligned workplace conditions\n  So that my workplace respects my dignity and enables my capacity for care and flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am employed at a restaurant with challenging conditions\n    And my workplace_elohim monitors workplace conditions and rights\n    And the protocol recognizes workers' care needs and labor rights\n    And I have access to workplace advocacy tools\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing workplace exploitation patterns\n    Given my employer demands maximum flexibility with minimal compensation\n    And I experience unpredictable scheduling, low wages, and poor conditions\n    When the workplace_elohim analyzes my employment situation\n    Then it should identify exploitation patterns\n    And help me recognize when conditions violate standards or norms\n    And provide information about my legal rights and protections\n    And empower me to name what I am experiencing\n\n  Scenario: Documenting workplace violations\n    Given my workplace may violate labor laws or regulations\n    Including wage theft, unsafe conditions, or scheduling violations\n    When I experience potential violations\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help me document incidents\n    And track patterns of violations over time\n    And provide guidance on reporting mechanisms\n    And preserve evidence for potential enforcement or advocacy\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for predictable scheduling\n    Given unpredictable scheduling destroys my capacity for care work\n    And I cannot manage household, health, or family needs without schedule stability\n    When I want to advocate for predictable scheduling\n    Then the protocol should help me build the case for schedule predictability\n    And provide evidence of how current scheduling harms my well-being\n    And support me in requesting schedule improvements\n    And connect me with co-workers who share this need\n\n  Scenario: Understanding and claiming wage rights\n    Given I am entitled to minimum wage, overtime pay, and tip protections\n    And wage theft is common in food service industry\n    When I track my hours and compensation\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help me verify I am paid correctly\n    And identify potential wage violations\n    And provide guidance on claiming unpaid wages\n    And support me in pursuing wage justice\n\n  Scenario: Organizing with co-workers for collective advocacy\n    Given individual workers have limited power\n    And collective action is more effective for workplace change\n    When I want to organize with co-workers for better conditions\n    Then the protocol should help me connect with co-workers safely\n    And facilitate coordination for collective advocacy\n    And provide information about organizing rights and strategies\n    And support building worker solidarity and collective power\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for care-economy-aligned workplace policies\n    Given my workplace treats me as labor unit without care needs\n    When I want to advocate for care-supportive policies\n    Then the protocol should help me propose specific policies\n    Such as paid sick leave, predictable scheduling, living wages, meal provisions\n    And provide evidence for why these policies support workers' flourishing\n    And help me communicate needs to management\n    And support pushing for workplace transformation\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing my labor as care contribution\n    Given I prepare food that nourishes people and serves community\n    When I view my work through care economy lens\n    Then the protocol should help me understand my work as care labor\n    And accumulate care tokens reflecting my contribution to community well-being\n    And reframe my relationship to work from pure exploitation to meaningful service\n    And build consciousness that my labor deserves dignity and fair compensation\n\n  Scenario: Accessing workplace accommodations for care needs\n    Given I may need accommodations for health, family, or care responsibilities\n    When I need to request workplace accommodations\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help me understand my rights\n    And support me in making formal accommodation requests\n    And provide guidance on documentation and process\n    And advocate for my right to work conditions that don't destroy my capacity for care\n\n  Scenario: Identifying unsafe or harmful workplace conditions\n    Given restaurant work involves physical demands and potential hazards\n    When I experience unsafe conditions or health risks\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help me identify hazards\n    And provide information about workplace safety rights\n    And support me in reporting unsafe conditions\n    And advocate for conditions that protect workers' health\n\n  Scenario: Navigating workplace power dynamics\n    Given employers have significant power over workers\n    And I may fear retaliation for advocating for my needs\n    When I need to navigate workplace advocacy carefully\n    Then the protocol should help me understand my protections\n    And provide strategies for advocacy that minimize retaliation risk\n    And connect me with legal resources if needed\n    And support me in exercising my rights despite power imbalance\n\n  Scenario: Demanding workplace democracy and worker voice\n    Given decisions affecting my life are made without my input\n    When I want to advocate for worker participation in decisions\n    Then the protocol should support advocacy for workplace democracy\n    And help me articulate the case for worker voice in governance\n    And provide information about worker ownership and cooperative models\n    And build consciousness that workers deserve decision-making power\n\n  Scenario: Making visible that current conditions prevent care work\n    Given my 50+ hour work weeks leave no time or energy for self-care or family care\n    When I want to demonstrate that work conditions are unsustainable\n    Then the protocol should help me document how work prevents care\n    And make visible the contradiction between work demands and human needs\n    And provide evidence for advocacy around reduced hours and better conditions\n    And build case that \"labor shortage\" is really \"dignity and compensation shortage\"\n",
