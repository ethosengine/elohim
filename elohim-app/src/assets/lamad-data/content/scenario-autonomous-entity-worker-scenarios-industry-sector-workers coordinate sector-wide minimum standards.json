  "content": "Scenario: Workers coordinate sector-wide minimum standards\n    Given different EAE food entities have varying wage and benefit levels\n    And workers want to prevent race-to-bottom competition\n    When food service sector workers hold coordination meeting\n    Then workers from multiple entities propose sector minimum wage ($18/hour)\n    And workers deliberate on benefits standards (paid sick leave, health insurance)\n    And sector workers vote to adopt coordinated minimums\n    And industry_sector_elohim helps enforce standards across network\n    And local entities can exceed minimums but not undercut them\n",
