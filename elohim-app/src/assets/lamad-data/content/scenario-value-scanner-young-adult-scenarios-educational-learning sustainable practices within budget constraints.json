  "content": "Scenario: Learning sustainable practices within budget constraints\n    Given Aisha wants to be environmentally responsible\n    And she has limited financial resources\n    When the personal_agent teaches sustainability\n    Then education should address real budget limitations\n    And it should teach affordable sustainable practices\n    And it should explain trade-offs between cost and environmental impact\n    And sustainability education should be practical, not preachy\n    And she should learn to make values-aligned choices within constraints\n    And environmental literacy should respect economic reality\n",
