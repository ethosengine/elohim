  "content": "Scenario: Analyzing Regional Constitutional Council decision patterns\n    Given Sarah Martinez's Regional Council has reviewed 500+ appeals\n    And I have anonymized data on appeals, deliberations, and outcomes\n    When I analyze patterns in regional constitutional interpretation\n    Then I examine: which types of appeals succeed vs fail\n    And I track: consistency across different council compositions\n    And I identify: whether councils reach similar conclusions for similar cases\n    And I explore: how precedent influences subsequent decisions\n    And I assess: whether councils defer too much to technical experts\n    And I investigate: demographic patterns in council member influence\n    And My analysis reveals: whether sortition governance produces coherent law\n",
