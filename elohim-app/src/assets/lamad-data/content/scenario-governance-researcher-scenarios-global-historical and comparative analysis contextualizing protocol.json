  "content": "Scenario: Historical and comparative analysis contextualizing protocol\n    Given I want to understand what's genuinely novel vs reinventing wheels\n    And I study governance history and comparative political theory\n    When I contextualize Elohim Protocol in historical perspective\n    Then I compare: to Athenian democracy's sortition practices\n    And I examine: medieval communes' participatory governance\n    And I analyze: modern citizens' assemblies and deliberative innovations\n    And I explore: attempts to govern non-human powerful systems (corporations, markets)\n    And I identify: what ancient wisdom applies and what's unprecedented\n    And I assess: whether humanity has governed comparable complexity before\n    And My historical analysis reveals: patterns and lessons across millennia\n",
