  "content": "Scenario: Maintaining hope for children's thriving despite single-parent family structure\n    Given society often assumes single-parent families are inherently deficient\n    And Maria worries about impact of solo parenting on her children\n    When the family_elohim assesses family well-being\n    Then it should recognize that children can thrive in single-parent families\n    And it should validate Maria's parenting rather than reinforcing deficit narratives\n    And it should help her see her children's actual thriving, not societal stereotypes\n    And it should remind her that she is enough for her children\n    And Maria should feel empowered as parent, not defined by family structure stigma\n",
