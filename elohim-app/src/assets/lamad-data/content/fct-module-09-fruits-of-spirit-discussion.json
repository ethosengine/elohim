    "instructions": "Metrics and Benchmarks\n\n\"If we truly believe that 'by their fruit you will recognize them' (Matthew 7:16), how might we reimagine our measures of success and growth in the church to reflect the Fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)? Consider both personal spiritual development and communal church life in your response.\"  \nThis elevated version:\n\nGrounds the question in scripture, reminding participants of the biblical basis for this approach.  \nDirectly references the Fruits of the Spirit, encouraging participants to consider each one (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control).  \nChallenges the notion of \"metrics\" by using the more holistic term \"measures of success and growth.\"  \nEncourages participants to think beyond just church attendance or giving, which are often default metrics.  \nPrompts consideration of both individual and community aspects of spiritual growth.  \nImplicitly questions current church practices without being confrontational.  \nInvites creative thinking about how abstract spiritual concepts might be practically observed or cultivated.\n\nThis reframed question should lead to a richer discussion about what truly matters in Christian life and how we might realign our focus and practices to nurture the Fruits of the Spirit in ourselves and our communities.",
