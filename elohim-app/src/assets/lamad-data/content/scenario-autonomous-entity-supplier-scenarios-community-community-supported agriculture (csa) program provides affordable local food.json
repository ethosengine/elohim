  "content": "Scenario: Community-supported agriculture (CSA) program provides affordable local food\n    Given fresh, organic produce is often unaffordable for low-income community members\n    And food access inequality creates health disparities\n    When democratic farm implements sliding-scale CSA program\n    Then weekly produce boxes are affordable across income levels\n    And payment flexibility (sliding scale, work-trade, subsidized) ensures access\n    And direct farm-to-community distribution reduces costs increasing affordability\n    And food access improves while supporting fair farmworker wages\n    And community_elohim manages CSA program ensuring equitable food access\n",
