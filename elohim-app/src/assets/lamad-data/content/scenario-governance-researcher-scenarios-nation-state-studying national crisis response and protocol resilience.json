  "content": "Scenario: Studying national crisis response and protocol resilience\n    Given nation experienced major crisis (pandemic, economic collapse, climate disaster)\n    And protocol governance was tested under extreme conditions\n    When I analyze how protocol functioned during and after crisis\n    Then I examine: whether emergency coordination maintained democratic oversight\n    And I assess: whether crisis pressures led to authoritarian drift\n    And I measure: community resilience with protocol vs without\n    And I explore: how Constitutional Councils balanced urgency with deliberation\n    And I identify: protocol vulnerabilities revealed under stress\n    And I analyze: recovery trajectories and institutional learning\n    And My research reveals: whether democratic AI governance is resilient or fragile\n",
