Family Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent\n  As a single parent managing family relationships and decisions alone\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want to serve each child's needs while managing family dynamics without co-parent support\n  So that my children thrive despite having only one actively present parent\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the single parent user \"Maria\" is registered in the system\n    And Maria is the only actively parenting adult for three children\n    And children are ages 6, 9, and 14 with different developmental needs\n    And Maria has no co-parent to consult or share parenting decisions\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim provides family relationship support\n\n  Scenario: Being the only parent relationship for three children simultaneously\n    Given Maria is her children's primary relationship and security\n    And she provides all parental emotional support alone\n    When children need parental attention and connection\n    Then the family_elohim should help Maria serve each child's relationship needs\n    And it should remind her that she's their entire parental support system\n    And it should help her distribute attention across three children fairly\n    And it should validate the weight of being their only secure adult attachment\n    And Maria should have support for impossible emotional labor of solo parenting\n\n  Scenario: Solo parenting decisions without partner consultation or validation\n    Given Maria makes every parenting decision alone\n    And she has no co-parent to discuss, debate, or validate choices\n    When Maria faces difficult parenting decisions\n    Then the family_elohim should provide decision support and perspective\n    And it should help her think through consequences and options\n    And it should partially fill the gap of missing partner consultation\n    And it should validate her decision-making authority\n    And Maria should have AI thinking partner for parenting choices\n\n  Scenario: Managing children's grief and questions about absent co-parent\n    Given children may grieve or question their absent other parent\n    And Maria must handle these emotions while managing her own feelings\n    When children express feelings about family structure\n    Then the family_elohim should help Maria respond appropriately to each child's age\n    And it should remind her to validate their feelings without defensiveness\n    And it should help her maintain healthy narrative about family structure\n    And it should support her in helping children process complicated family reality\n    And Maria should have guidance for emotionally complex parenting situations\n\n  Scenario: Serving 6-year-old's wonder needs while managing two other children\n    Given her youngest child is at peak wonder and exploration stage\n    And this age needs substantial parental engagement and presence\n    When Maria serves her 6-year-old's developmental needs\n    Then the family_elohim should remind her of age-appropriate activities\n    And it should help her protect wonder time despite other demands\n    And it should prevent youngest from being neglected due to older siblings' needs\n    And it should help her be present for this critical developmental stage\n    And Maria should successfully nurture her youngest despite impossible time constraints\n\n  Scenario: Navigating 9-year-old's growing autonomy and competence\n    Given her middle child is developing independence and self-direction\n    And this age needs balance of freedom and parental guidance\n    When Maria parents her 9-year-old\n    Then the family_elohim should help her calibrate appropriate autonomy\n    And it should remind her of developmental milestones to support\n    And it should help her stay connected while allowing necessary independence\n    And it should prevent middle child from being lost between younger and older siblings\n    And Maria should serve this complex developmental stage effectively\n\n  Scenario: Managing 14-year-old's teen complexity and emerging adulthood\n    Given her oldest is navigating adolescence with all its challenges\n    And teens need parent as secure base while pushing for independence\n    When Maria parents her teenager\n    Then the family_elohim should provide teen development guidance\n    And it should help her maintain connection despite natural teen separation\n    And it should remind her to stay engaged even when teen seems not to want her\n    And it should help her navigate discipline, boundaries, and growing autonomy\n    And Maria should successfully parent a teen without co-parent support\n\n  Scenario: Preventing oldest child from becoming surrogate parent to younger siblings\n    Given Maria's 14-year-old may feel responsible for younger siblings\n    And parentification is common and harmful in single-parent families\n    When the family_elohim monitors family dynamics\n    Then it should detect if teen is taking on too much parental responsibility\n    And it should alert Maria to concerning patterns\n    And it should help her accept appropriate help while preventing harmful role-reversal\n    And it should protect her teen's adolescence and development\n    And the protocol should prevent damage from well-intentioned but unhealthy dynamics\n\n  Scenario: Extended family support coordination with maintained boundaries\n    Given Maria may receive support from her own parents or siblings\n    And extended family help can be complicated by distance or family dynamics\n    When extended family contributes to children's care\n    Then the family_elohim should track and coordinate extended family involvement\n    And it should help Maria maintain boundaries around parenting authority\n    And it should recognize extended family contributions without ceding control\n    And it should prevent grandparents or others from overstepping\n    And Maria should retain parental sovereignty while accepting help\n\n  Scenario: Family rituals and traditions maintained by solo parent\n    Given Maria wants to create meaningful family traditions and rituals\n    And she must plan and execute all traditions alone\n    When family traditions and special occasions occur\n    Then the family_elohim should help Maria plan manageable family rituals\n    And it should remind her of important traditions and celebrations\n    And it should help her create meaningful family culture despite time constraints\n    And it should prevent holiday stress from overwhelming solo parent capacity\n    And Maria's family should have rich traditions despite single-parent limitations\n\n  Scenario: Managing sibling conflicts with no co-parent to tag team\n    Given children will conflict with each other\n    And Maria handles all conflict resolution alone with no one to tag in\n    When sibling conflicts arise\n    Then the family_elohim should provide conflict resolution guidance\n    And it should help Maria address conflicts fairly and age-appropriately\n    And it should remind her to stay calm when she's the only adult managing chaos\n    And it should prevent her exhaustion from leading to ineffective responses\n    And Maria should successfully navigate sibling dynamics without co-parent backup\n\n  Scenario: Individual quality time with each child despite impossible schedule\n    Given each child needs one-on-one parent time\n    And Maria must provide all individual attention alone across three children\n    When Maria allocates time with children\n    Then the family_elohim should help her protect individual connection time\n    And it should remind her that each child needs her undivided attention sometimes\n    And it should coordinate schedules to create brief one-on-one moments\n    And it should prevent any child from being consistently neglected\n    And Maria should maintain individual relationships with each child despite constraints\n\n  Scenario: Family care tokens reflect Maria's role as sole active parent\n    Given Maria provides all active parenting for three children\n    And she's performing care work of two parents alone\n    When family care tokens are calculated\n    Then Maria's tokens should reflect solo parenting of multiple children\n    And the protocol should recognize she's providing all emotional support, guidance, and presence\n    And her care contributions should be valued higher than partnered parents\n    And quantified solo parenting work should validate her superhuman efforts\n    And society should see undeniable proof that single parents deserve extraordinary support\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining hope for children's thriving despite single-parent family structure\n    Given society often assumes single-parent families are inherently deficient\n    And Maria worries about impact of solo parenting on her children\n    When the family_elohim assesses family well-being\n    Then it should recognize that children can thrive in single-parent families\n    And it should validate Maria's parenting rather than reinforcing deficit narratives\n    And it should help her see her children's actual thriving, not societal stereotypes\n    And it should remind her that she is enough for her children\n    And Maria should feel empowered as parent, not defined by family structure stigma\n",
