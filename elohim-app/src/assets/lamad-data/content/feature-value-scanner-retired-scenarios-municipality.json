Municipality Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person\n  As a retired person in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the municipality governance layer\n  I want my civic participation valued and elder needs addressed in municipal policy\n  So that retirement is recognized as continued citizenship and municipalities serve all ages\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the retired user \"Frank\" is registered in the system\n    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction\n    And Frank participates actively in municipal civic life\n    And the municipality governance context is active\n    And the municipal_elohim coordinates civic engagement and policy\n    And Frank's volunteer work addresses needs municipal policy should handle\n\n  Scenario: Volunteer labor addressing municipal housing needs quantified\n    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity\n    And Habitat builds affordable housing the municipality fails to provide\n    And his volunteer work substitutes for municipal housing policy\n    When the municipal_elohim tracks housing care economy\n    Then Frank's volunteer construction work should be quantified\n    And aggregate volunteer labor should be calculated municipality-wide\n    And data should reveal that volunteers provide housing infrastructure\n    And municipal housing policy should recognize volunteer contributions\n    And Frank's work should demonstrate need for municipal investment\n    And volunteers should be understood as filling municipal policy gaps\n\n  Scenario: Retired residents as civic engagement resource for municipal governance\n    Given Frank has time freedom enabling substantial civic participation\n    And many retired residents can attend daytime meetings and hearings\n    When the municipal_elohim coordinates civic engagement\n    Then it should recognize retired residents as civic participation resource\n    And facilitate their attendance at municipal meetings and hearings\n    And coordinate testimony and advocacy utilizing their availability\n    And recognize civic engagement as care contribution\n    And retired residents should be understood as democracy infrastructure\n    And Frank should participate meaningfully in municipal governance\n    And elder voice should shape municipal policy\n\n  Scenario: Municipal care economy data informs retirement policy\n    Given Frank's care contributions are tracked through Value Scanner\n    And municipal data reveals aggregate retired resident contributions\n    When the municipal_elohim analyzes retirement care economy\n    Then it should quantify total volunteer labor from retired residents\n    And calculate market value of unpaid care work (~millions annually)\n    And surface that retired residents provide massive municipal value\n    And inform policy recognizing caregiving in benefit calculations\n    And demonstrate that retirement is transition to care work, not exit from contribution\n    And support municipal policy that values and supports retired residents\n\n  Scenario: Municipal services accessibility for aging residents\n    Given Frank is aging and may have mobility or transportation limitations\n    And municipal services should remain accessible to all residents\n    When the municipal_elohim coordinates service accessibility\n    Then it should ensure public buildings are physically accessible\n    And public transit should serve aging residents' mobility needs\n    And municipal services should be available in formats accessible to aging users\n    And digital services should accommodate aging-related changes\n    And Frank should access municipal services with dignity\n    And universal design should serve residents across lifespan\n\n  Scenario: Municipal food security programs recognize retired residents on fixed income\n    Given Frank lives on $28k/year fixed income\n    And food costs are significant portion of limited budget\n    When the municipal_elohim coordinates food security\n    Then Frank should access municipal food programs without stigma\n    And his care contributions should be visible in program eligibility\n    And food assistance should be framed as reciprocity, not charity\n    And municipal programs should recognize his volunteer contributions\n    And care economy should connect to food security infrastructure\n    And Frank should experience dignity in accessing food resources\n\n  Scenario: Municipal public transit serves retired residents without car access\n    Given Frank may not be able to afford car ownership\n    And he relies on public transit and walking\n    When the municipal_elohim coordinates transportation\n    Then public transit should serve Frank's mobility needs effectively\n    And routes and schedules should accommodate non-employment patterns\n    And transit should enable access to medical, social, and civic destinations\n    And affordable transit should support continued community participation\n    And Frank should maintain mobility and independence through public infrastructure\n    And municipal transportation should serve residents across lifespan\n\n  Scenario: Municipal recreation and social programs prevent elder isolation\n    Given Frank needs social connection to maintain wellbeing\n    And isolation increases with age without intentional connection\n    When the municipal_elohim coordinates social infrastructure\n    Then it should provide programs connecting retired residents\n    And senior centers should be framed as community hubs, not warehouses\n    And programs should facilitate continued contribution and purpose\n    And Frank should access social connection through municipal infrastructure\n    And elder isolation should be prevented through public programs\n    And municipal policy should recognize social connection as health infrastructure\n\n  Scenario: Municipal planning includes elder wisdom and long-term perspective\n    Given Frank has lived in the municipality for decades\n    And he's observed long-term patterns and changes\n    When the municipal_elohim facilitates planning processes\n    Then it should actively seek Frank's long-term perspective\n    And elder wisdom should inform infrastructure and policy decisions\n    And decades of observation should guide municipal adaptation\n    And Frank's experience should be valued in planning conversations\n    And municipal governance should benefit from elder knowledge\n    And intergenerational planning should integrate experienced voices\n\n  Scenario: Municipal healthcare coordination supports aging residents\n    Given Frank and his wife both have aging-related healthcare needs\n    And navigating healthcare is increasingly complex\n    When the municipal_elohim coordinates healthcare access\n    Then it should help Frank navigate Medicare and healthcare systems\n    And coordinate with municipal health services\n    And support access to preventive and chronic care\n    And connect healthcare to care economy support systems\n    And Frank should maintain health through accessible municipal infrastructure\n    And municipal health policy should serve aging residents effectively\n\n  Scenario: Municipal emergency preparedness utilizes retired residents' availability\n    Given Frank has daytime availability and construction skills\n    And municipalities need emergency response capacity\n    When the municipal_elohim coordinates emergency preparedness\n    Then it should include retired residents in emergency planning\n    And utilize their skills and availability for emergency response\n    And coordinate community-level resilience with municipal systems\n    And recognize retired residents as municipal emergency resource\n    And Frank should contribute meaningfully to collective safety\n    And municipal preparedness should leverage care economy networks\n\n  Scenario: Municipal recognition of informal care work in economic indicators\n    Given Frank provides substantial unpaid care work\n    And traditional municipal economic indicators ignore care economy\n    When the municipal_elohim tracks economic activity\n    Then it should include care work in municipal economic reporting\n    And Frank's volunteer labor should be counted in economic indicators\n    And municipal GDP should reflect care economy contributions\n    And retirement should be understood as economic participation\n    And policy should be based on complete economic picture\n    And Frank's contributions should be visible in municipal economics\n\n  Scenario: Municipal housing policy supports aging in place\n    Given Frank wants to age in his community\n    And housing costs are significant on fixed income\n    When the municipal_elohim coordinates housing policy\n    Then it should support policies enabling aging in place\n    And affordable housing should serve retired residents on fixed income\n    And Frank should not be displaced by rising housing costs\n    And municipal policy should recognize his decades of community contribution\n    And housing should be treated as right, not commodity\n    And care economy contributions should inform housing access\n",
