  "content": "Scenario: Coordinating family decision-making about major changes\n    Given major decisions affect my children and our whole family\n    And I want children to have age-appropriate voice while I retain authority\n    When we face decisions about housing, location, schooling, or other major changes\n    Then the family_elohim facilitates age-appropriate family discussions\n    And helps children express their needs and preferences\n    And supports me in making final decisions considering everyone's input\n    And tracks family decision-making process\n    And validates children's participation without parentifying them\n    And my personal_agent ensures all voices are heard appropriately\n    And recognizes inclusive decision-making as sophisticated parenting\n    And celebrates family decisions made together\n",
