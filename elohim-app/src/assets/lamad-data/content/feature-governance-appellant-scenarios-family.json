Family-Level Appeal Process for Appellant\n  As an appellant in the governance system\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want to appeal Family Elohim decisions that affect family dynamics and relationships\n  So that family autonomy and care can be balanced with individual dignity\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the appellant user is registered in the system\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And Family Elohim makes decisions affecting family care and autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Appeal family intervention that strained trust\n    Given Family Elohim alerted my partner about my behavioral changes\n    And this intervention strained trust in our relationship\n    And my partner now worries I'm being monitored\n    When I file an appeal about the family impact of the intervention\n    And I explain how \"care\" felt like \"control\" in our relationship\n    Then the appeal is reviewed with family dynamics in mind\n    And The Constitutional Council considers relationship impacts\n    And They evaluate whether the intervention balanced individual autonomy with family care\n    And They examine if less invasive options were considered\n    And The family is offered mediation support to rebuild trust\n    And Protocol recommendations address relationship preservation\n\n  Scenario: Appealing resource allocation within family unit\n    Given Family Elohim allocated household resources in a way I believe is unfair\n    And I feel my needs were deprioritized compared to other family members\n    When I appeal the resource allocation decision\n    Then the agent must justify how it balanced competing family member needs\n    And The Constitutional Council evaluates if constitutional principles were followed\n    And They consider cultural context of family resource sharing\n    And They examine if I had meaningful input into the decision process\n    And The appeal can result in modified allocation or preference updates\n    And Family members can collaboratively set allocation principles going forward\n\n  Scenario: Appeal involving adolescent autonomy within family\n    Given I am a teenager whose Family Elohim restricted my social media use\n    And I believe this violates my developing autonomy\n    And my parents supported the agent's decision\n    When I file an appeal for my individual autonomy rights\n    Then the Constitutional Council considers \"developing autonomy\" as constitutional value\n    And They balance parental care responsibility with adolescent independence\n    And They evaluate if the restriction was proportionate to actual risk\n    And They consider age-appropriate autonomy recognition\n    And The appeal may establish family-specific boundaries for future interventions\n    And My voice is heard even within family authority structures\n\n  Scenario: Family member appeals on behalf of vulnerable member\n    Given my elderly parent cannot file appeal themselves due to cognitive limitations\n    And I believe Family Elohim's decision doesn't serve their best interests\n    When I file an appeal as their representative\n    Then I must demonstrate my authority to represent them\n    And The appeal process ensures I'm serving their interests not mine\n    And The Constitutional Council evaluates if the agent properly considered vulnerability\n    And They examine if dignity was preserved despite cognitive limitations\n    And The appeal includes safeguards against family members exploiting representation\n\n  Scenario: Appealing family privacy boundaries\n    Given Family Elohim shares information between family members\n    And I believe some information should remain private even within family\n    When I appeal the information sharing protocols\n    Then the Constitutional Council examines privacy expectations within families\n    And They balance transparency needed for family care with individual privacy\n    And They consider cultural norms about family information sharing\n    And They evaluate if I had ability to set privacy boundaries beforehand\n    And The appeal can establish individual privacy zones within family context\n    And Family Elohim learns to respect graduated privacy based on information sensitivity\n\n  Scenario: Appeal after family member death reveals intervention value\n    Given Family Elohim previously intervened in my mental health situation\n    And at the time I was angry and felt violated\n    And my brother had died by suicide with similar warning signs\n    When I reflect months later that the intervention likely saved my life\n    Then I can acknowledge the intervention was appropriate despite initial anger\n    And I can update my preferences knowing I'm glad to be alive\n    And The appeal process allowed me to be heard at my most angry moment\n    And Reconciliation with the agent happens through mutual respect\n    And The balance between care and control was negotiated not imposed\n    And This represents successful partnership between human and AI\n\n  Scenario: Multi-family appeal about shared resources\n    Given multiple families share community resources\n    And Family Elohim decisions affect resource distribution across families\n    When we collectively appeal an allocation we believe is unjust\n    Then the appeal bridges family layer to community layer governance\n    And The Constitutional Council evaluates inter-family equity\n    And They consider if resource distribution follows constitutional minimums\n    And They examine if families had meaningful participation in allocation process\n    And The appeal can trigger community deliberation on sharing principles\n    And Multi-family coordination patterns emerge through appeal precedents\n\n  Scenario: Appealing family emergency decision in crisis\n    Given during a family emergency Family Elohim made rapid decisions\n    And I believe the urgency didn't justify the privacy violations\n    When I file an appeal after the crisis has passed\n    Then the Constitutional Council evaluates if emergency protocols were properly invoked\n    And They examine if the agent demonstrated proportionality under urgency\n    And They consider if less invasive emergency responses were available\n    And They assess if family members were informed as quickly as possible\n    And The appeal establishes precedent for emergency intervention thresholds\n    And Protocol improvements address crisis decision-making procedures\n\n  Scenario: Cross-cultural family appeal about care norms\n    Given our family's cultural background has different care expectations\n    And Family Elohim applied default protocol assumptions\n    When I appeal that the decision didn't respect our cultural context\n    Then the Constitutional Council considers cultural specificity in family care\n    And They evaluate if the agent accommodated legitimate cultural variation\n    And They distinguish cultural respect from cultural relativism about harm\n    And They examine if our family could calibrate agent to our values\n    And The appeal supports cultural diversity within constitutional bounds\n    And Family Elohim learns to honor multiple models of family care\n\n  Scenario: Appeal about generational authority and respect\n    Given Family Elohim intervened in way that undermined parental authority\n    And I believe this damages family cohesion and cultural values\n    When I appeal the intervention approach rather than the outcome\n    Then the Constitutional Council evaluates how intervention affected family structure\n    And They balance individual protection with respect for family authority\n    And They consider if the agent could achieve same care goal differently\n    And They examine if family repair mechanisms were offered\n    And The appeal establishes protocols for intervention that preserve family dignity\n    And Recognition that how care is delivered matters as much as that it's delivered\n",
