Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent\n  As a grandparent with traditional knowledge of sustainable living\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want my environmental wisdom and care practices to be recognized\n  So that ecological knowledge is transmitted across generations\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the grandparent user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret grew up with practices of careful resource use\n    And Margaret has knowledge of food preservation, gardening, seasonal patterns\n    And Margaret teaches grandchildren Tommy (5) and Emma (8) ecological practices\n    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active\n    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates environmental care economy\n\n  Scenario: Traditional knowledge of food preservation and storage\n    Given Margaret knows how to preserve food, reduce waste, maximize resources\n    And these skills were essential in her generation\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks traditional ecological knowledge\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's food preservation skills as valuable\n    And it should value her knowledge of canning, freezing, storing food\n    And it should facilitate teaching these skills to grandchildren\n    And traditional knowledge should be documented and transmitted\n    And Margaret's expertise should contribute to food security\n    And ecological wisdom should accumulate care tokens\n    And sustainable food practices should be valued and preserved\n\n  Scenario: Teaching grandchildren sustainable living practices\n    Given Margaret teaches Tommy and Emma to reduce waste and value resources\n    And she models careful use of food, water, energy, materials\n    When Margaret provides ecological education\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize environmental teaching\n    And it should value transmission of sustainable living practices\n    And it should track grandchildren's ecological learning\n    And environmental education should accumulate care tokens\n    And Margaret's teaching should be recognized as essential for sustainability\n    And next generation should learn resource stewardship from elders\n\n  Scenario: Knowledge of seasonal patterns and bioregional ecology\n    Given Margaret has observed local seasons, weather, and ecology for decades\n    And she knows when plants bloom, birds migrate, harvest happens\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks ecological knowledge\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's bioregional expertise\n    And it should value her understanding of local seasonal patterns\n    And it should document traditional ecological knowledge\n    And seasonal wisdom should be shared with grandchildren and community\n    And Margaret's observation should contribute to bioregional understanding\n    And traditional knowledge should inform ecological care\n\n  Scenario: Gardening and local food production with grandchildren\n    Given Margaret gardens and teaches grandchildren about growing food\n    And they learn where food comes from and how to nurture plants\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food production activities\n    Then it should recognize gardening as ecological care work\n    And it should value teaching food production as essential education\n    And it should track local food growing and knowledge transmission\n    And gardening should accumulate care tokens\n    And Margaret's teaching should support food sovereignty\n    And intergenerational food knowledge should be preserved\n\n  Scenario: Practices of frugality and resource conservation\n    Given Margaret's generation learned to waste nothing and maximize resources\n    And these practices are essential for ecological sustainability\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks resource conservation\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's frugal practices as ecological wisdom\n    And it should value conservation skills and waste reduction\n    And it should track resource efficiency and reuse practices\n    And frugality should be reframed as environmental stewardship\n    And Margaret's practices should be recognized as climate action\n    And traditional conservation knowledge should be valued and transmitted\n\n  Scenario: Teaching reciprocal relationship with natural world\n    Given Margaret teaches grandchildren to respect and care for nature\n    And she models reciprocal relationship rather than extractive use\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks ecological values education\n    Then it should recognize teaching reciprocity with nature\n    And it should value relationship-based environmental ethics\n    And it should track development of ecological consciousness\n    And values education should accumulate care tokens\n    And Margaret's teaching should support bioregional care economy\n    And next generation should learn ecological reciprocity\n\n  Scenario: Knowledge of traditional medicinal and useful plants\n    Given Margaret knows traditional uses of local plants\n    And she learned herbal remedies and plant knowledge from her elders\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks traditional plant knowledge\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's ethnobotanical expertise\n    And it should value traditional medicinal plant knowledge\n    And it should facilitate transmission of plant wisdom to grandchildren\n    And traditional knowledge should be documented and preserved\n    And Margaret's expertise should contribute to bioregional health\n    And plant knowledge should be recognized as valuable care economy contribution\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating sustainable practices with family consumption\n    Given Margaret influences family's consumption and waste patterns\n    And she can teach sustainable shopping and resource use\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates family sustainability\n    Then it should help Margaret guide family toward sustainable practices\n    And it should recognize her role in shaping family ecological impact\n    And it should track family's movement toward sustainability\n    And Margaret's influence should reduce family's environmental footprint\n    And intergenerational sustainability should be recognized and valued\n    And family care economy should include ecological care\n\n  Scenario: Participating in community ecological restoration and care\n    Given Margaret has time and commitment for environmental stewardship\n    And community needs participants in ecological restoration\n    When Margaret participates in community environmental work\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize ecological care contributions\n    And it should value restoration work, cleanup, and stewardship\n    And it should track community environmental participation\n    And ecological care should accumulate care tokens\n    And Margaret's environmental service should be recognized\n    And community ecological health should benefit from elder participation\n\n  Scenario: Teaching food sovereignty through kitchen skills\n    Given Margaret knows how to cook from scratch and make nutritious meals\n    And kitchen skills support food sovereignty and health\n    When Margaret teaches grandchildren cooking and food preparation\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize cooking as care work\n    And it should value food sovereignty education\n    And it should track kitchen skills transmission\n    And cooking should accumulate care tokens\n    And Margaret's teaching should support family and community food security\n    And traditional food knowledge should be preserved and valued\n\n  Scenario: Modeling low-consumption lifestyle for next generation\n    Given Margaret lives simply on retirement income\n    And her low-consumption lifestyle has low environmental impact\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks consumption patterns\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's low-impact lifestyle as ecological contribution\n    And it should value simple living as environmental stewardship\n    And it should show grandchildren that fulfillment doesn't require high consumption\n    And low-impact living should be recognized as climate action\n    And Margaret's lifestyle should model sustainable living\n    And intergenerational value transmission should support sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Traditional weather knowledge and climate adaptation\n    Given Margaret has observed local weather patterns for decades\n    And traditional weather knowledge supports climate adaptation\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks traditional climate knowledge\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's weather wisdom\n    And it should value traditional ecological forecasting\n    And it should document climate observation across decades\n    And Margaret's knowledge should inform community climate adaptation\n    And traditional knowledge should complement scientific understanding\n    And elder wisdom should support bioregional resilience\n",
