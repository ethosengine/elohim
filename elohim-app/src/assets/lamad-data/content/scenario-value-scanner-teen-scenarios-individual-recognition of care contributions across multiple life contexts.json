  "content": "Scenario: Recognition of care contributions across multiple life contexts\n    Given Jasmine contributes care work in multiple domains\n    And she works 15 hours/week at her part-time job\n    And she does substantial household labor\n    And she volunteers 4 hours/week at community center\n    When her personal_agent aggregates her care contributions\n    Then all contexts should be recognized: household, paid work, volunteering, civic engagement\n    And care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions\n    And her work should be made visible as genuine economic participation\n    And she should see herself as a productive member of society\n    And her care contributions should give her standing in care economy discussions\n",
