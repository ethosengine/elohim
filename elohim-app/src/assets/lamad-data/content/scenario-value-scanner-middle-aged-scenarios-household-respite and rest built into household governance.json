  "content": "Scenario: Respite and rest built into household governance\n    Given Robert and Jennifer both experience care burden\n    And sustainable care requires rest and renewal\n    And they may deprioritize their own rest\n    When household_elohim monitors wellbeing\n    Then it should recognize when both partners need respite\n    And prompt: \"Neither of you has had break from care responsibilities in 6 weeks\"\n    And help them plan respite care for parents\n    And coordinate breaks from care demands\n    And validate that rest is essential, not selfish\n    And support them in maintaining capacity for sustainable care\n    And prevent burnout that would harm all family members\n",
