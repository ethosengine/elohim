Democratic Workplace Governance for Worker\n  As a worker in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer\n  I want democratic control over my workplace operations\n  So that we collectively shape our working conditions and value distribution\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And ChickenMax #247 has converted to EAE democratic ownership\n    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active\n    And workers have transitioned from corporate hierarchy to democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Workers democratically decide on operational schedules\n    Given scheduling was previously dictated by management\n    And workers had no input on shift assignments\n    When the democratic workplace holds a scheduling governance session\n    Then Maria proposes a schedule balancing operational needs with worker life needs\n    And DeShawn suggests modifications for his college class schedule\n    And workers vote on the proposed schedule with governance weight based on seniority and contribution\n    And the approved schedule is implemented immediately\n    And no manager can override the democratic decision\n\n  Scenario: Democratic value distribution replaces hierarchical extraction\n    Given ChickenMax generates $100K monthly revenue\n    And elimination of franchise fees freed $48K annually\n    When workers hold their quarterly value distribution governance meeting\n    Then transparent REA accounting shows complete revenue and cost breakdown\n    And workers democratically decide wage allocation ($60K to wages)\n    And workers vote on community program funding ($10K to senior meals)\n    And workers approve environmental sustainability investment ($8K to regenerative sourcing)\n    And every worker sees exactly how value flows and why\n    And workers can modify distribution algorithms democratically\n\n  Scenario: Workers recall underperforming coordinator through democratic process\n    Given Marcus transitioned from manager to democratic coordinator\n    And workers have expressed concerns about his facilitation effectiveness\n    When workers initiate a recall process\n    Then workplace_elohim facilitates a fair evaluation process\n    And Marcus receives specific feedback on coordination failures\n    And workers vote on recall with 2/3 supermajority required\n    And if recalled, Marcus transitions gracefully with support for next role\n    And democratic accountability prevents hierarchical abuse\n\n  Scenario: Worker council makes strategic decisions about business direction\n    Given corporate previously mandated menu, pricing, and suppliers\n    And workers now govern these strategic decisions democratically\n    When Emma proposes direct relationships with local farmers\n    Then worker council deliberates on supply chain transition\n    And workers analyze cost/benefit of local vs. corporate sourcing\n    And workers vote on adopting Johnson Farm as primary vegetable supplier\n    And the decision is implemented immediately\n    And menu adapts to seasonal availability from democratic supplier relationships\n\n  Scenario: Conflict resolution through democratic process, not managerial fiat\n    Given DeShawn and another worker have a scheduling disagreement\n    And corporate model would have manager impose solution\n    When the conflict is brought to worker council\n    Then workplace_elohim facilitates mediated discussion\n    And both workers express their perspectives and needs\n    And council members propose compromise solutions\n    And workers reach consensus on fair schedule accommodation\n    And conflict is resolved through transparency and democratic process\n\n  Scenario: Workers democratically hire new team members\n    Given ChickenMax needs to hire an additional worker\n    And hiring was previously manager's unilateral decision\n    When the hiring process begins\n    Then workers collectively develop job description and qualifications\n    And multiple workers participate in interviewing candidates\n    And workers evaluate candidates based on skill fit and values alignment\n    And final hiring decision requires worker council approval\n    And new hires integrate into democratic culture from day one\n\n  Scenario: Democratic workplace implements innovation suggested by worker\n    Given Emma has identified a workflow optimization\n    And corporate system previously prohibited worker-initiated changes\n    When Emma proposes the optimization at worker council meeting\n    Then workers deliberate on implementation feasibility\n    And workers vote to pilot Emma's optimization for two weeks\n    And results are measured and shared transparently\n    And if successful, Emma's innovation is permanently adopted\n    And Emma receives recognition and compensation for the contribution\n\n  Scenario: Workers set quality standards democratically, not corporate mandates\n    Given corporate enforced speed metrics that eroded quality\n    And workers value quality and customer satisfaction over transaction speed\n    When workers establish their own quality standards\n    Then worker council defines quality metrics emphasizing care and excellence\n    And workers reject corporate-style speedup pressure\n    And customer feedback is incorporated through democratic review\n    And workers balance efficiency with dignity and quality\n    And workplace_elohim ensures standards maintain business sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Workers exercise governance voice weighted by documented contribution\n    Given REA accounting documents each worker's contributions over time\n    And democratic governance weights votes by contribution and seniority\n    When workers vote on major strategic decisions\n    Then Maria's 8 years of documented expertise weights her vote higher\n    And newer workers have proportional but meaningful voice\n    And weighting is transparent and democratically adjustable\n    And workplace_elohim ensures weighting doesn't become oligarchic\n    And all workers maintain baseline voice protecting their dignity\n\n  Scenario: Workers transition from corporate extraction to democratic ownership progressively\n    Given ChickenMax has just converted to EAE ownership\n    And workers are learning democratic governance practices\n    When workers hold their first month of democratic operations\n    Then early decisions are worker-proposed, coordinator-advised, worker-approved\n    And workers gradually take on more complex governance decisions\n    And training is provided for business operations, bookkeeping, and strategy\n    And workplace_elohim facilitates learning democratic skills\n    And after 6 months, workers govern fully with coordinator in support role only\n\n  Scenario: Workers access transparent financial information previously hidden by corporate\n    Given corporate kept financial information opaque to workers\n    And workers now have complete financial transparency\n    When workers access the financial dashboard\n    Then they see real-time revenue, costs, and profit\n    And they see exactly how much was previously extracted by franchise fees\n    And they see supplier costs and markup comparisons\n    And they see complete compensation breakdown for all workers\n    And they can audit any financial transaction\n    And workplace_elohim ensures financial literacy support for all workers\n",
