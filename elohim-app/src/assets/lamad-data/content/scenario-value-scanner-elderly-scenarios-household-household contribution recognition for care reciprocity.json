  "content": "Scenario: Household contribution recognition for care reciprocity\n    Given Helen has lived in this home for 40 years\n    And she raised family and contributed to community from this household\n    When household care economy is tracked\n    Then her lifetime of household labor should be visible\n    And her decades of contribution should create legitimate claims\n    And current care receipt should be framed as reciprocity\n    And she should not feel like a burden in her own home\n    And the household_elohim should surface her contribution history\n    And care flowing to her should be recognized as earned through lifetime of giving\n",
