Individual Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver\n  As a caregiver for dependent adults\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want my personal well-being and identity maintained amid intensive caregiving\n  So that I can sustain care work without losing myself or collapsing from burnout\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the caregiver user \"James\" is registered in the system\n    And James cares for his husband David (52) who has early-onset Alzheimer's\n    And James also coordinates care for his mother (76)\n    And James works part-time (~20 hours/week) as IT contractor\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And James's personal_agent monitors his well-being constantly\n    And care intensity is high and progressive\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver's own identity preserved amid intensive care work\n    Given James's life is consumed by caregiving responsibilities\n    And he risks losing his identity as caregiving intensifies\n    When the personal_agent monitors James's individual well-being\n    Then it should protect tiny spaces for his own identity\n    And it should remind him that his flourishing matters too\n    And it should recognize when caregiving threatens his sense of self\n    And it should prompt activities that sustain his individual identity\n    And caregiving should not erase who James is as a person\n\n  Scenario: Professional-grade care labor quantified and made visible\n    Given James provides skilled care equivalent to professional nursing\n    And he manages medications with precision\n    And he provides cognitive support and emotional care\n    And this work would be valued at $50k+/year for a stranger\n    When the personal_agent tracks James's care contributions\n    Then his care labor should be quantified as professional-grade work\n    And care tokens should reflect the true value of his skills\n    And his contributions should be valued at professional nursing rates\n    And invisible care work should become economically visible\n    And society should see he's performing skilled professional care\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver burnout detection and prevention\n    Given caregiver burnout is real and dangerous\n    And James is at risk of physical and emotional collapse\n    When the personal_agent monitors for burnout warning signs\n    Then it should detect declining nutrition in James\n    And it should recognize sleep deprivation patterns\n    And it should notice increasing social isolation\n    And it should identify health problems emerging\n    And it should alert James before burnout becomes crisis\n    And it should proactively connect him to respite resources\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver's emotional labor recognized as valuable work\n    Given James grieves David's progressive decline daily\n    And he manages profound emotional labor constantly\n    And he maintains David's dignity through devastating loss\n    When the personal_agent tracks James's emotional work\n    Then this labor should be recognized as skilled care work\n    And emotional support should be valued alongside physical care\n    And the weight of ongoing grief should be acknowledged\n    And emotional caregiving should accumulate care tokens\n    And society should see that caregiving is emotionally devastating work\n\n  Scenario: Individual autonomy maintained within caregiving constraints\n    Given caregiving severely limits James's choices\n    And he cannot leave David for extended periods\n    And his schedule revolves entirely around care needs\n    When James makes personal decisions\n    Then the personal_agent should protect his autonomy\n    And it should identify opportunities for individual agency\n    And it should help James maintain some life beyond caregiving\n    And constraints should be acknowledged but not completely controlling\n    And James should retain some sphere of personal freedom\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver's own health monitoring and protection\n    Given James neglects his own health amid caregiving\n    And caregiver health decline creates cascading crisis\n    When the personal_agent monitors James's health\n    Then it should ensure he attends his own medical appointments\n    And it should prompt him to take prescribed medications\n    And it should recognize when his health is declining\n    And it should insist on self-care when necessary\n    And James's health should be protected as essential infrastructure\n\n  Scenario: Personal nutrition maintained despite overwhelming demands\n    Given James often skips meals while caring for David\n    And his nutrition suffers under caregiving pressure\n    When the personal_agent monitors James's eating patterns\n    Then it should recognize inadequate nutrition\n    And it should prompt meal planning that includes James\n    And it should ensure James maintains basic nutrition\n    And his well-being should be prioritized alongside David's\n    And the protocol should prevent James's health decline\n\n  Scenario: Social connection preserved against isolation\n    Given intensive caregiving creates profound isolation\n    And James loses social connections as care intensifies\n    When the personal_agent monitors social isolation\n    Then it should recognize dangerous isolation patterns\n    And it should prompt James to maintain key relationships\n    And it should suggest respite opportunities for social connection\n    And it should connect him to other caregivers who understand\n    And social isolation should be actively prevented\n\n  Scenario: Individual care token accumulation reflects care work value\n    Given James provides care worth $50k+/year professionally\n    And his work is invisible because he cares for his spouse\n    When care tokens are calculated for James\n    Then tokens should reflect professional-grade care value\n    And his care work should accumulate significant tokens\n    And tokens should give him standing in care economy\n    And invisible spousal care should become economically visible\n    And care economy should recognize family caregiving at professional value\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver's sleep protected as essential resource\n    Given James is often awakened by David's nighttime needs\n    And chronic sleep deprivation threatens his ability to provide care\n    When the personal_agent monitors James's sleep patterns\n    Then it should recognize dangerous sleep deprivation\n    And it should prompt solutions for better sleep\n    And it should suggest respite care for nighttime support\n    And it should treat sleep as essential care infrastructure\n    And James's rest should be protected for sustainable caregiving\n\n  Scenario: Individual grief processing supported amid ongoing loss\n    Given James experiences anticipatory grief constantly\n    And he's losing David slowly while providing daily care\n    When the personal_agent recognizes James's grief\n    Then it should connect him to grief support resources\n    And it should acknowledge the unique pain of progressive loss\n    And it should support his emotional processing\n    And grief should be recognized as ongoing burden, not one-time event\n    And the protocol should hold space for James's devastating loss\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver's own future planning despite uncertainty\n    Given James faces uncertain future as David's condition progresses\n    And he needs to plan for multiple scenarios\n    When James considers his own future needs\n    Then the personal_agent should help him plan for scenarios\n    And it should recognize his vulnerability as caregiver\n    And his care token accumulation should build toward future security\n    And his own aging and care needs should be part of planning\n    And the protocol should help James prepare for his own vulnerability\n",
