  "content": "Scenario: Developer prevailing wage compliance gains monitoring\n    Given a developer receives public subsidy requiring prevailing wage\n    And claims compliance with wage requirements\n    When the Observer monitors wage compliance\n    Then analysis shows: certified payroll reports show prevailing wage\n    But worker interviews reveal unpaid overtime and deductions\n    And actual take-home pay is below prevailing wage requirements\n    And compliance on paper differs from worker reality\n    And enforcement mechanisms need worker-centered monitoring\n",
