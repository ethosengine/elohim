  "content": "Scenario: Acknowledging uncertainty in technical analysis\n    Given appellant questions agent's 85% confidence in suicide risk pattern\n    And council asks if the confidence level is reliable\n    When I provide honest uncertainty assessment\n    Then I explain: we don't have validated ground truth for this prediction type\n    And I acknowledge: the 85% might be overconfident or underconfident\n    And I clarify: what we know and what we don't know\n    And I avoid: hiding behind expert authority to eliminate uncertainty\n    And I enable: council to make decision under acknowledged uncertainty\n    And I demonstrate: that honesty about limits builds trust\n    And citizens know: when they're governing despite deep uncertainty\n",
