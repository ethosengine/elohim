  "content": "Scenario: Appeal contributes to constitutional evolution\n    Given my appeal revealed a fundamental gap in the constitutional framework\n    And the Constitutional Council identified this as a recurring issue\n    When the council documents recommendations for protocol improvement\n    Then my case becomes input for the next 7-year Constitutional Convention\n    And My lived experience of feeling violated despite life-saving intervention\n    And This helps shape how care and autonomy are balanced at constitutional level\n    And I can see the long-term impact of my appeal beyond my individual case\n    And My suffering wasn't wasted\u2014it made the system better for everyone\n",
