Industry Sector Coordination and Solidarity for Worker\n  As a worker in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the industry_sector governance layer\n  I want to coordinate with workers across businesses for collective power\n  So that we build sector-wide solidarity and resist race-to-bottom pressures\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And multiple food service EAE entities exist across the region\n    And the industry_sector governance context is active\n    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates cross-business collaboration\n\n  Scenario: Workers share best practices across EAE food service entities\n    Given Maria has developed effective training methods at ChickenMax\n    And Garden Bowl Express is onboarding new workers\n    When Maria's training patterns are documented by REA system\n    Then industry_sector_elohim identifies the transferable practice\n    And Garden Bowl workers are notified of Maria's successful training approach\n    And Maria is invited to conduct cross-entity training session\n    And her expertise benefits the entire food service sector\n    And Maria receives compensation for sector contribution\n\n  Scenario: Workers coordinate sector-wide minimum standards\n    Given different EAE food entities have varying wage and benefit levels\n    And workers want to prevent race-to-bottom competition\n    When food service sector workers hold coordination meeting\n    Then workers from multiple entities propose sector minimum wage ($18/hour)\n    And workers deliberate on benefits standards (paid sick leave, health insurance)\n    And sector workers vote to adopt coordinated minimums\n    And industry_sector_elohim helps enforce standards across network\n    And local entities can exceed minimums but not undercut them\n\n  Scenario: Workers provide mutual aid across businesses during crisis\n    Given ChickenMax experiences unexpected staffing shortage\n    And Garden Bowl Express has capacity to help\n    When ChickenMax requests temporary worker support\n    Then industry_sector_elohim coordinates cross-entity worker loan\n    And Garden Bowl workers volunteer to help ChickenMax for two weeks\n    And compensation is shared fairly between entities\n    And Maria trains Garden Bowl workers on ChickenMax operations\n    And sector solidarity prevents individual business failures\n\n  Scenario: Workers collectively negotiate with suppliers for better terms\n    Given individual EAE entities have limited purchasing power\n    And workers want fair prices and quality ingredients\n    When sector workers coordinate procurement\n    Then industry_sector_elohim aggregates demand across food entities\n    And workers collectively negotiate with Johnson Farm for volume pricing\n    And sector workers secure better prices than individual entities could\n    And all participating entities benefit from collective bargaining\n    And sector purchasing power rivals corporate chains without exploitation\n\n  Scenario: Workers share customer demand patterns for collective benefit\n    Given Emma notices increasing demand for vegan options at ChickenMax\n    And other food entities are also seeing this trend\n    When REA systems document customer preference patterns\n    Then industry_sector_elohim aggregates sector-wide demand data\n    And workers across entities learn of vegan demand trend\n    And sector coordinates with suppliers for plant-based ingredients\n    And workers collaborate on vegan menu development\n    And sector responds to customer needs faster than corporate competitors\n\n  Scenario: Workers coordinate sector response to corporate competitive pressure\n    Given a corporate chain attempts to undercut EAE entities on price\n    And individual entities cannot match corporate predatory pricing alone\n    When workers detect the competitive threat\n    Then industry_sector_elohim alerts all sector workers\n    And workers coordinate response emphasizing quality and values\n    And workers develop public narrative about democratic vs. extractive business\n    And sector pools marketing resources to compete collectively\n    And coordinated response succeeds where isolated entities would fail\n\n  Scenario: Workers transfer between EAE entities with portable expertise recognition\n    Given DeShawn has accumulated 3 years of documented expertise at ChickenMax\n    And he wants to move to Garden Bowl Express for career growth\n    When DeShawn applies for position at Garden Bowl\n    Then his ChickenMax REA profile is recognized across network\n    And his skill tokens are valid at Garden Bowl\n    And his seniority partially transfers based on sector contribution\n    And Garden Bowl workers welcome him as proven contributor\n    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates fair transition for both entities\n\n  Scenario: Workers build sector-wide safety standards exceeding legal minimums\n    Given different entities have varying safety protocols\n    And workers prioritize safety over corporate-style speedup\n    When sector workers establish safety working group\n    Then workers from multiple entities share safety best practices\n    And workers collectively develop sector safety standards\n    And standards exceed legal minimums in key areas\n    And industry_sector_elohim monitors compliance across sector\n    And sector reputation for safety becomes competitive advantage\n\n  Scenario: Workers coordinate political advocacy for democratic business policies\n    Given municipal government is considering economic development policies\n    And workers want policies supporting democratic ownership\n    When sector workers organize advocacy campaign\n    Then workers from multiple EAE entities testify at city council\n    And workers present data on democratic business benefits\n    And workers advocate for procurement preferences and tax incentives\n    And coordinated worker voice influences policy more than isolated entities\n    And sector political power protects and expands democratic economy\n\n  Scenario: Workers learn specialized skills through sector apprenticeship program\n    Given different EAE entities have different specialty expertise\n    And Emma wants to learn about grain milling at Garden Bowl\n    When Emma applies for sector cross-training opportunity\n    Then industry_sector_elohim matches her interest with Garden Bowl capacity\n    And Emma spends two weeks learning grain milling alongside ChickenMax work\n    And both entities benefit from cross-pollination of expertise\n    And Emma returns with new skills enhancing ChickenMax operations\n    And sector-wide learning builds collective capability\n\n  Scenario: Workers coordinate industry response to supply chain disruption\n    Given tomato blight affects regional supply from Johnson Farm\n    And individual entities would struggle with ingredient shortage\n    When industry_sector_elohim detects the disruption\n    Then sector workers coordinate menu adjustments across all entities\n    And workers share alternative supplier relationships\n    And entities with surplus inventory support those with shortages\n    And sector responds collectively to minimize customer impact\n    And coordinated resilience prevents business failures and worker layoffs\n",
