  "content": "Scenario: Defending legislation against corporate capture testimony\n    Given corporate lobbyists testify against my legislation\n    And they claim it \"stifles innovation\"\n    When I respond in committee hearing\n    Then I present: evidence from Riverside and research\n    And I show: protocol improves community outcomes\n    And I demonstrate: constitutional oversight working\n    And I compare: to corporate AI failures (surveillance, discrimination, no recourse)\n    And I argue: we're stifling extraction, enabling flourishing\n    And I maintain: that democracy deserves support\n    And committee votes: 8-5 in favor despite lobbying\n",
