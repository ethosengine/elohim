  "content": "Scenario: Managing household privacy and safety boundaries\n    Given I have safety concerns about my abuser finding me\n    And household information could compromise our safety\n    When I manage household information sharing\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me control what information exists about household location\n    And supports necessary anonymity with service providers\n    And helps me teach children appropriate privacy practices\n    And tracks who has what information about our household\n    And alerts me to potential privacy/safety breaches\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of safety protocols\n    And recognizes that managing safety is constant cognitive and emotional labor\n    And validates that my vigilance is appropriate and necessary\n",
