  "content": "Scenario: Journalist fact-checks mayor's budget claims in real-time\n    Given the mayor gives state of city address with budget claims\n    And the journalist watches speech with deadline pressure\n    When the Observer provides instant fact-checking against city records\n    Then the journalist verifies mayor claims crime is down (true by 3%)\n    And fact-checks claim of record affordable housing investment (false - down 12%)\n    And checks police budget claim against actual spending (misleading framing)\n    And publishes real-time fact-check during speech\n    And rhetoric meets evidence-based accountability immediately\n",
