  "content": "Scenario: Connecting with peer support from others experiencing similar vulnerability\n    Given I need connection with people who understand domestic violence, housing crisis, or similar challenges\n    And peer support reduces isolation and provides practical wisdom\n    When I seek peer support through community network\n    Then the community_elohim connects me to peer support groups\n    And identifies others with shared experiences willing to connect\n    And facilitates mutual support relationships\n    And validates that peer support is different from professional services\n    And protects privacy while enabling genuine connection\n    And my personal_agent helps me participate in peer community\n    And recognizes peer support relationships as care economy contribution\n    And celebrates mutual understanding and solidarity\n",
