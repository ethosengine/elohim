  "content": "Scenario: Teacher understanding of single-parent household stress on children\n    Given children in single-parent families may experience unique stressors\n    And teachers should understand these realities without stigmatizing\n    When teachers work with Maria's children\n    Then the educational_elohim should help educators understand single-parent contexts\n    And teachers should recognize potential impacts on children without deficit framing\n    And children should receive appropriate support without being labeled as \"at-risk\" due to family structure\n    And schools should support thriving despite different family structures\n    And Maria's children should be seen as individuals, not stereotyped by single-parent status\n",
