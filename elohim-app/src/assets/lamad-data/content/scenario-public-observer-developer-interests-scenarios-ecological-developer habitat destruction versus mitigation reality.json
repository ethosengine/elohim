  "content": "Scenario: Developer habitat destruction versus mitigation reality\n    Given a developer destroys 40 acres of forest for development\n    And promises habitat mitigation will offset ecological loss\n    When the Observer tracks mitigation outcomes over five years\n    Then analysis shows: mitigation site has 40% native species survival\n    And ecological function is fraction of destroyed habitat\n    And offset calculation was based on optimistic assumptions not reality\n    And net ecological loss is substantial despite mitigation promises\n    And honest accounting informs better environmental protection policy\n",
