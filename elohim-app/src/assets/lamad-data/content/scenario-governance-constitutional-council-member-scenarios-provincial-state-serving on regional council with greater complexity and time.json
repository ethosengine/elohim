  "content": "Scenario: Serving on Regional Council with greater complexity and time\n    Given I was selected for Regional Constitutional Council\n    And this layer handles escalated appeals and novel situations\n    When I begin my 4-month term meeting twice weekly\n    Then I review: cases that couldn't be resolved at community layer\n    And I deliberate: complex constitutional questions affecting region\n    And I create: precedent influencing multiple communities\n    And I work with: citizens from diverse communities across region\n    And I receive: enhanced training for greater responsibility\n    And I am compensated: for significant time commitment\n    And I feel: weight of creating regional constitutional law\n",
