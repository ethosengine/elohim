  "content": "Scenario: Sustainable protein choices within budget\n    Given protein production has varied environmental impact\n    And Aisha wants to make sustainable choices\n    When Aisha selects protein sources\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should show environmental impact differences\n    And it should highlight lower-impact protein options\n    And it should help her access affordable sustainable proteins\n    And plant-based options should be presented when cheaper\n    And environmental impact should inform protein decisions\n    And sustainable nutrition should be achievable on her budget\n",
