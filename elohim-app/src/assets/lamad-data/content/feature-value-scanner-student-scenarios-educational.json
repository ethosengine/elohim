Educational Layer Value Recognition for Student\n  As a student whose primary work is learning and development\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want my learning recognized as valuable work and care economy participation\n  So that education is understood as mutual care investment rather than mere credential acquisition\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the student user \"Kenji\" is registered in the system\n    And Kenji is studying environmental science full-time\n    And Kenji's primary \"work\" is learning and development\n    And Kenji also teaches peers informally and contributes to learning community\n    And the educational governance context is active\n    And the educational_elohim could coordinate learning relationships\n    And education requires substantial unpaid labor from students\n\n  Scenario: Learning recognized as valuable work, not just credential pursuit\n    Given Kenji spends 40+ hours per week on academic work\n    And traditional economics treats student labor as non-productive\n    When the educational_elohim tracks Kenji's educational work\n    Then it should recognize studying as labor that creates value\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for learning work\n    And it should validate \"You invested 45 hours in learning this week\"\n    And student intellectual labor should be valued, not invisible\n    And the system should recognize education as work toward capability development\n    And learning should be understood as care economy investment\n\n  Scenario: Student contribution to peer learning community\n    Given Kenji helps classmates understand difficult concepts\n    And peer teaching strengthens everyone's learning\n    When the educational_elohim tracks peer teaching\n    Then it should recognize Kenji's teaching labor as care contribution\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for tutoring peers\n    And it should value \"Kenji explained organic chemistry to 3 struggling classmates\"\n    And peer education should be recognized as community care work\n    And the system should make student teaching labor visible\n    And intellectual generosity should be valued and encouraged\n\n  Scenario: Connecting academic learning to care economy values\n    Given Kenji studies environmental science\n    And his field directly relates to planetary care economy\n    When the educational_elohim connects learning to care principles\n    Then it should help Kenji see environmental science as care work\n    And it should link his academic study to ecological stewardship\n    And it should show how his education prepares him for care contributions\n    And learning should be framed as developing capacity to serve flourishing\n    And the system should integrate academic work with care economy purpose\n    And Kenji should understand his education as care economy investment\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing educational institution care economy failures\n    Given Kenji's college charges high tuition while many students face food insecurity\n    And educational institutions can exploit student labor\n    When the educational_elohim helps Kenji analyze institutional practices\n    Then it should teach him to recognize extractive vs. care-based institutions\n    And it should help him see when colleges fail care economy principles\n    And it should validate his critique of exploitative educational models\n    And the system should build critical awareness of institutional care failures\n    And Kenji should learn to evaluate institutions through care economy lens\n    And educational institutions should be accountable to care economy standards\n\n  Scenario: Study group coordination as care economy practice\n    Given Kenji participates in study groups with peers\n    And study groups require coordination, hosting, and emotional labor\n    When the educational_elohim tracks study group participation\n    Then it should recognize hosting study group as care contribution\n    And it should value coordinating schedules and managing group dynamics\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for creating learning spaces\n    And study group labor should be visible and valued\n    And the system should recognize collective learning as care economy\n    And academic collaboration should be understood as mutual care\n\n  Scenario: Balancing learning work with survival work\n    Given Kenji must work 15 hours/week to afford basic expenses\n    And work hours compete with study time\n    When the educational_elohim helps Kenji balance competing demands\n    Then it should recognize the impossible tension between learning and survival\n    And it should help him optimize limited time across demands\n    And it should validate that he cannot do everything perfectly\n    And it should advocate for better institutional support for working students\n    And the system should recognize structural unfairness in student economics\n    And Kenji should not be blamed for constraints created by inadequate support\n\n  Scenario: Student labor contributions to educational institutions\n    Given Kenji might do research work, TA work, or other academic labor\n    And universities benefit from student labor beyond tuition\n    When the educational_elohim tracks student labor\n    Then it should recognize unpaid or underpaid student work for institution\n    And it should help Kenji understand fair compensation for academic labor\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for labor that benefits university\n    And student labor should be recognized and fairly compensated\n    And the system should help students identify labor exploitation\n    And educational institutions should not extract uncompensated labor\n\n  Scenario: Learning disabilities and accommodations as care economy\n    Given some students need educational accommodations\n    And accommodations require advocacy and coordination\n    When students access disability services\n    Then the educational_elohim should support accommodation advocacy\n    And it should recognize student labor of managing accommodations\n    And it should value disability services as institutional care work\n    And accommodation should be understood as educational care economy\n    And the system should support equitable access to education\n    And disability justice should be core to educational care economy\n\n  Scenario: Connecting classroom learning to lived experience\n    Given Kenji learns economic theory in classes\n    And he lives care economy reality daily in his household\n    When the educational_elohim bridges theory and practice\n    Then it should help Kenji see connections between academic concepts and daily life\n    And it should validate his experiential knowledge as real learning\n    And it should show how his household management applies economic principles\n    And lived experience should be recognized as legitimate knowledge source\n    And the system should integrate academic and experiential learning\n    And Kenji's practical care economy work should inform his academic understanding\n\n  Scenario: Student mental health support as educational care infrastructure\n    Given academic pressure threatens student mental health\n    And learning requires emotional and psychological well-being\n    When educational institutions provide mental health support\n    Then the educational_elohim should recognize counseling as educational care\n    And it should value mental health services as essential to learning\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for peer emotional support\n    And mental health work should be understood as educational infrastructure\n    And the system should recognize that learning requires whole-person care\n    And educational care economy includes psychological and emotional support\n\n  Scenario: Alternative education models aligned with care economy\n    Given traditional higher education often fails care economy principles\n    And alternative models exist (cooperative education, free universities, community learning)\n    When Kenji explores educational alternatives\n    Then the educational_elohim should inform him of care-aligned options\n    And it should help him evaluate educational models against care principles\n    And it should recognize diverse pathways for learning and development\n    And the system should support student exploration of alternative education\n    And education should serve flourishing, not just credential accumulation\n    And care economy education should be accessible and diverse\n\n  Scenario: Lifelong learning beyond formal education\n    Given Kenji's learning will continue after graduation\n    And education is lifelong process, not just college phase\n    When the educational_elohim supports ongoing learning\n    Then it should help Kenji develop self-directed learning capabilities\n    And it should recognize informal learning as valuable as formal coursework\n    And it should encourage learning from community, work, and life experience\n    And lifelong learning should be valued as care economy participation\n    And the system should support learning as continuous development\n    And education should be understood as lifelong care economy investment\n\n  Scenario: Student voice in educational governance and policy\n    Given students are primary stakeholders in education\n    And educational policies directly affect student well-being\n    When students participate in educational governance\n    Then the educational_elohim should recognize advocacy as care contribution\n    And it should value student organizing for better policies\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for participating in governance\n    And student voice should be central to educational decision-making\n    And the system should amplify student participation in education policy\n    And students should govern their educational institutions democratically\n",
