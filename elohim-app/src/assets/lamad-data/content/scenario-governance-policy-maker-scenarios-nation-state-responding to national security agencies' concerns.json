  "content": "Scenario: Responding to national security agencies' concerns\n    Given intelligence agencies claim protocol creates vulnerabilities\n    And they request backdoors or monitoring capabilities\n    When I evaluate security claims critically\n    Then I consult: cryptographers about technical impossibility\n    And I examine: whether concerns are legitimate or pretext\n    And I compare: risks of backdoors vs risks they claim to address\n    And I consider: historical abuse of security exceptions\n    And I establish: oversight mechanisms if special provisions needed\n    And I resist: security becoming excuse for unaccountable power\n    And I protect: democracy even under security claims\n",
