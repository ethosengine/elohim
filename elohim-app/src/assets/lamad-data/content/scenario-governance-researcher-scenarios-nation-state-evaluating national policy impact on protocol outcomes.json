  "content": "Scenario: Evaluating national policy impact on protocol outcomes\n    Given Senator Ruiz passed legislation supporting protocol adoption\n    And I want to assess whether policy actually improved outcomes\n    When I analyze communities before and after policy implementation\n    Then I examine: whether funding increased adoption rates\n    And I assess: whether legal recognition improved legitimacy\n    And I measure: whether infrastructure support reduced access barriers\n    And I explore: whether regulatory protection prevented capture\n    And I identify: which policy mechanisms worked and which didn't\n    And My evaluation provides: evidence for continued funding and policy refinement\n    And Research serves: accountability and improvement of democratic policy\n",
