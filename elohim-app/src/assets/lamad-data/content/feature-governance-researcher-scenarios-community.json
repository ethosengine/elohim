Community-Level Governance Research for Researcher\n  As a researcher in the governance system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want to conduct intensive case studies of how sortition governance works in practice\n  So that I can understand lived experience and inform democratic AI governance theory\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the researcher user is registered in the system\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And Dr. James Chen is studying democratic innovation and AI governance\n\n  Scenario: Conducting ethnographic research in Riverside community\n    Given I have selected Riverside (population 45,000) for intensive case study\n    And I have secured ethical approval and community consent\n    When I begin multi-month observation of protocol implementation\n    Then I can attend Constitutional Council meetings as observer\n    And I can interview appellants like Marcus about their appeal experience\n    And I can participate in community deliberations about protocol\n    And I can track resource flows and wellbeing indicators\n    And I can document challenges and successes as they emerge\n    And The community retains ownership of data about themselves\n    And My research serves community improvement not just academic publication\n\n  Scenario: Observing Constitutional Council deliberation in real-time\n    Given Community Constitutional Council is reviewing Marcus's mental health appeal\n    And I have permission to observe their deliberation\n    When I document how the council works through the case\n    Then I capture: argument patterns, member interactions, uncertainty navigation\n    And I analyze: how expertise influences judgment, how dissent gets resolved\n    And I examine: quality of deliberation, constitutional reasoning depth\n    And I observe: what enables effective citizen governance\n    And I document: dynamics that retrospective analysis would miss\n    And My research reveals how sortition democracy actually works\n    And Findings feed back to improve council support and training\n\n  Scenario: Interviewing appellant about appeal experience and recourse\n    Given Marcus appealed his Family Elohim's mental health intervention\n    And he has consented to research interview\n    When I ask about his experience of the appeal process\n    Then he shares: emotional impact of feeling violated then heard\n    And he describes: accessibility of appeal interface, dignity of process\n    And he explains: how explanation changed his understanding\n    And he reflects: reconciliation with agent through meaningful recourse\n    And I learn: what made the process feel legitimate despite initial anger\n    And I understand: lived experience that statistics cannot capture\n    And His story humanizes governance mechanisms for research audience\n\n  Scenario: Tracking community wellbeing indicators over time\n    Given Riverside adopted Elohim Protocol three years ago\n    And I am measuring community outcomes longitudinally\n    When I analyze wellbeing data before and after adoption\n    Then I examine: loneliness rates (down 12%), life satisfaction (up 8%)\n    And I track: crisis response effectiveness, economic resilience\n    And I monitor: social cohesion, trust in institutions, civic participation\n    And I conduct: comparison with similar communities without protocol\n    And I use: difference-in-differences analysis to isolate protocol effects\n    And I distinguish: what's protocol impact vs what's secular trend\n    And I provide: evidence about whether democratic AI governance works\n\n  Scenario: Identifying implementation challenges through participant observation\n    Given I am embedded in Riverside for six months\n    And I observe daily reality of protocol implementation\n    When I encounter challenges residents and leaders face\n    Then I document: elderly residents struggling with technology\n    And I note: three Constitutional Council decisions that residents opposed\n    And I observe: recurring tension around adolescent autonomy\n    And I identify: gaps between theory and practice\n    And I analyze: what enables some communities to thrive while others struggle\n    And My research reveals: practical wisdom about implementation\n    And Findings help other communities avoid pitfalls Riverside encountered\n\n  Scenario: Collaborating with Mayor Jamal on participatory action research\n    Given I want research to serve community not just extract data\n    And Mayor Jamal wants evidence to improve local governance\n    When we co-design research questions and methods\n    Then community priorities shape what we study\n    And Local residents participate in data collection\n    And We jointly interpret findings considering context I might miss\n    And Research addresses actual needs not just academic curiosity\n    And Riverside learns from comparative findings across communities\n    And Results improve local implementation immediately\n    And Research relationship respects community autonomy and knowledge\n\n  Scenario: Analyzing appeal patterns to understand constitutional interpretation\n    Given Riverside's Constitutional Council has reviewed 150 appeals over three years\n    And I have access to anonymized appeal data\n    When I analyze patterns in appeal types, outcomes, and reasoning\n    Then I identify: which decisions generate most appeals (adolescent autonomy)\n    And I examine: what predicts appeal success (constitutional strength, evidence quality)\n    And I track: how constitutional interpretation evolves through precedent\n    And I discover: whether marginalized communities have equal access to recourse\n    And I assess: if appeal process functions as democratic accountability mechanism\n    And My analysis reveals: how procedural justice works in practice\n    And Findings inform improvements to appeal accessibility and council training\n\n  Scenario: Studying trust building through transparent governance\n    Given trust in institutions is central question for democratic AI\n    And Riverside provides natural experiment in transparency effects\n    When I measure trust over time and mechanisms that build it\n    Then I examine: whether seeing agent reasoning increases confidence\n    And I explore: if meaningful recourse builds trust more than perfect decisions\n    And I analyze: role of local Constitutional Council in legitimacy\n    And I investigate: whether transparency enables manipulation or builds confidence\n    And I track: how trust relationships between residents and agents evolve\n    And My research tests: whether democratic governance of AI creates sustainable trust\n    And Evidence informs: design of governance systems elsewhere\n\n  Scenario: Documenting community-specific calibration process\n    Given Riverside calibrated privacy thresholds higher than protocol default\n    And this reflected community values and history\n    When I document how community calibration happened\n    Then I capture: deliberation process that led to calibration decision\n    And I analyze: how community exercised sovereignty within constitutional bounds\n    And I examine: role of community leader in facilitating values discussion\n    And I track: whether calibration actually served community better\n    And I study: how local diversity strengthens rather than fragments protocol\n    And My research demonstrates: subsidiarity in practice\n    And Findings support: community autonomy as democratic AI principle\n\n  Scenario: Ethical data practices respecting community sovereignty\n    Given I am studying Riverside residents and their governance\n    And I have access to sensitive information about their lives\n    When I conduct research following ethical protocols\n    Then I obtain: informed consent from all research participants\n    And I ensure: anonymization and privacy protection in publications\n    And I provide: community review of findings before publication (for accuracy)\n    And I share: research benefits with Riverside (payments support community fund)\n    And I respect: community right to revoke access if research becomes harmful\n    And I practice: research ethics aligned with dignity principles protocol embodies\n    And My methodology demonstrates: how to study communities without extracting from them\n\n  Scenario: Research findings immediately improve local governance\n    Given my research identified that Constitutional Council deliberations improve with certain information tools\n    And I shared findings with Mayor Jamal and council members\n    When community decides to implement recommended improvements\n    Then research serves practical improvement not just academic knowledge\n    And Rapid feedback loop connects insight to implementation\n    And Community sees research benefiting them directly\n    And Researcher-community trust strengthens through mutual value\n    And Knowledge serves flourishing not just publication\n    And Research demonstrates: scholarship in service of democracy\n",
