  "content": "Scenario: Learning that contributes to community knowledge without exploitation\n    Given Tommy's learning patterns generate educational data\n    And this data could improve pedagogy for other children\n    When Tommy's anonymized learning data is collected\n    Then it must only be used to improve educational outcomes\n    And Tommy's privacy must be absolutely protected\n    And no commercial exploitation of learning data should occur\n    And data should serve collective learning, not surveillance capitalism\n    And Tommy's education must never be monetized\n",
