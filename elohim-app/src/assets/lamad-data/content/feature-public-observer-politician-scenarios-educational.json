Education Policy Governance for Elected Representative\n  As a politician in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want to make informed education policy decisions\n  So that I can serve student wellbeing despite technical complexity and ideological pressure\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the politician user is registered in the system\n    And the educational governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Politician understands education outcome patterns across demographics\n    Given the politician governs education policy at state or district level\n    And achievement gaps persist across racial and economic lines\n    When the Observer analyzes outcome patterns systemically\n    Then they see which student populations are underserved\n    And identify specific schools with equitable outcomes despite demographics\n    And learn what successful schools do differently\n    And understand resource and practice patterns that drive equity\n    And champion evidence-based policies for all students\n\n  Scenario: Politician evaluates curriculum controversy with evidence beyond ideology\n    Given vocal activists demand curriculum changes on ideological grounds\n    And both sides present culture war framing\n    When the Observer provides evidence-based curriculum analysis\n    Then they see what's actually taught in classrooms versus political claims\n    And review curriculum outcomes in student learning and engagement\n    And identify teacher and parent perspectives beyond activist voices\n    And compare curriculum to best practices in high-performing districts\n    And make decision based on educational merit not political pressure\n\n  Scenario: Politician tracks accountability for education reform implementation\n    Given the politician championed reading improvement initiative\n    And allocated funding for evidence-based interventions\n    When the Observer monitors implementation and outcomes\n    Then they see which schools implement reforms with fidelity\n    And track reading proficiency changes after intervention\n    And identify schools where implementation stalled or failed\n    And understand barriers to effective implementation\n    And intervene to ensure funding translates to student outcomes\n\n  Scenario: Politician surfaces teacher and parent priorities at scale\n    Given the politician hears from organized advocacy groups\n    But suspects classroom realities differ from political narratives\n    When the Observer aggregates teacher and parent input\n    Then they see teachers prioritize classroom resources and planning time\n    And learn parents want smaller class sizes and mental health support\n    And identify disconnect between political fights and family priorities\n    And understand professional educator perspectives on policy proposals\n    And align education policy with teaching and learning needs\n\n  Scenario: Politician evaluates charter school expansion with comprehensive analysis\n    Given charter advocates push for expansion with achievement promises\n    And traditional public school advocates warn of harmful impacts\n    When the Observer analyzes charter performance and impacts\n    Then they see charter outcomes controlling for selective enrollment\n    And understand fiscal impacts on district school budgets\n    And identify which students benefit from charters versus harmed\n    And review discipline and expulsion patterns for vulnerable students\n    And make informed decision balancing innovation with equity\n\n  Scenario: Politician builds coalition for education funding increase\n    Given the politician champions education investment\n    And needs public support for tax increase\n    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities\n    Then they see parents across political spectrum support smaller class sizes\n    And identify business community concern about workforce preparation\n    And connect with educators who can explain funding impacts\n    And facilitate coalition across traditional political divides\n    And build broad-based campaign for education investment\n\n  Scenario: Politician exposes education funding inequities across schools\n    Given the politician suspects resource distribution creates outcome gaps\n    When the Observer analyzes education funding patterns\n    Then they see experienced teachers concentrated in affluent schools\n    And identify per-student spending disparities within districts\n    And understand how funding formulas create systematic inequities\n    And calculate impact of equitable funding on underserved schools\n    And champion funding reforms with evidence of current harms\n\n  Scenario: Politician distinguishes education reform evidence from ideology\n    Given competing reform proposals claim research support\n    And ideological advocacy masks as evidence-based policy\n    When the Observer evaluates education research rigorously\n    Then they see which reforms have strong evidence base\n    And identify advocacy research versus peer-reviewed findings\n    And understand limitations and contexts of research claims\n    And compare reform outcomes across diverse implementation sites\n    And make evidence-based policy decisions beyond ideological fights\n\n  Scenario: Politician monitors special education compliance and outcomes\n    Given the politician has legal obligation to serve students with disabilities\n    And families report barriers to appropriate services\n    When the Observer tracks special education implementation\n    Then they see evaluation and IEP compliance rates by school\n    And identify which students wait longest for evaluations\n    And understand resource allocation for special education services\n    And learn where families face pushback on service requests\n    And ensure legal obligations and student needs are met\n\n  Scenario: Politician navigates high-stakes testing debate with outcome focus\n    Given testing requirements create political controversy\n    And both supporters and critics make competing claims\n    When the Observer analyzes testing data and educational impacts\n    Then they see how much instructional time testing consumes\n    And understand what testing reveals versus distorts about learning\n    And identify schools where testing drives harmful practices\n    And review alternative assessment models in other states\n    And balance accountability needs with teaching and learning quality\n",
