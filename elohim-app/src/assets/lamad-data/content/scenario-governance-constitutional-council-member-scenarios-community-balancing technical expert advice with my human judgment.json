  "content": "Scenario: Balancing technical expert advice with my human judgment\n    Given Marcus's case involves complex pattern detection algorithms\n    And I don't understand the technical details\n    When technical expert Dr. Okonkwo explains the agent's reasoning\n    Then she translates: cryptographic proofs into accessible language\n    And she clarifies: what confidence levels mean and their limitations\n    And she acknowledges: uncertainties and competing interpretations\n    And she informs: but doesn't tell us what decision is right\n    And I weigh: her technical knowledge alongside my human wisdom\n    And I judge: whether constitutional principles were honored\n    And I respect: expertise without surrendering my judgment authority\n",
