Household Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent\n  As a single parent managing solo household operations\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want efficient household management with AI support replacing missing co-parent\n  So that my household thrives despite having only one adult making all decisions\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the single parent user \"Maria\" is registered in the system\n    And Maria manages a household of four (herself and three children ages 6, 9, and 14)\n    And Maria has no co-parent to share decision-making or household labor\n    And household income is $42k/year from Maria's sole employment\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And the household_elohim coordinates household operations\n\n  Scenario: Household governance as necessary autocracy with age-appropriate child input\n    Given Maria is the only adult making every household decision\n    And children need appropriate voice based on developmental stage\n    When household decisions are made\n    Then the household_elohim should support Maria's final authority\n    And it should help her gather age-appropriate input from children\n    And her 14-year-old should have more voice than younger children\n    And her 6-year-old should have simple choices within boundaries\n    And household governance should be efficient while respecting all members\n    And Maria should maintain control without becoming authoritarian\n\n  Scenario: Extreme budget management with $42k for four people\n    Given Maria supports four people on $42k annual income\n    And this requires maximizing every dollar\n    When Maria makes purchasing decisions\n    Then the household_elohim should track spending against severe constraints\n    And it should help her find the efficiency frontier for every category\n    And it should identify savings opportunities across housing, food, utilities, necessities\n    And it should help her make informed trade-offs between competing needs\n    And Maria should have sophisticated support for household economics under constraint\n\n  Scenario: Grocery management with $175 per week for four people\n    Given Maria feeds four people on $175/week budget\n    And this requires strategic planning and waste prevention\n    When Maria plans grocery shopping\n    Then the household_elohim should optimize for maximum nutrition per dollar\n    And it should coordinate strategic shopping across stores based on sales\n    And it should plan meals that stretch ingredients efficiently\n    And it should prevent food waste she cannot afford\n    And Maria should achieve remarkable efficiency with AI support\n\n  Scenario: Solo household labor tracking shows work of two parents\n    Given Maria performs all household labor alone\n    And she does cooking, cleaning, laundry, maintenance, logistics, planning\n    When household labor is tracked\n    Then the household_elohim should quantify all of Maria's work\n    And it should make visible that she's doing work normally split between two adults\n    And tracking should validate that solo parenting is literally double the labor\n    And Maria's care token accumulation should reflect superhuman household contribution\n    And society should see quantified proof of single parents' extraordinary work\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating three children's different developmental needs simultaneously\n    Given Maria parents a 6-year-old, 9-year-old, and 14-year-old alone\n    And each child has completely different needs, schedules, and emotional requirements\n    When Maria manages children's needs\n    Then the household_elohim should help her track each child's developmental stage\n    And it should coordinate different school schedules and activities\n    And it should remind her of each child's unique needs\n    And it should prevent younger children from being neglected due to teen's demands\n    And Maria should have AI support for impossible multi-child coordination\n\n  Scenario: Emergency household backup when Maria is sick or overwhelmed\n    Given Maria has no co-parent to tag in during crisis\n    And she must parent even when sick or exhausted\n    When Maria faces personal emergency or is at breaking point\n    Then the household_elohim should detect crisis situation\n    And it should activate emergency backup networks\n    And it should connect to neighbors who can provide temporary support\n    And it should help coordinate emergency meal provision or childcare\n    And Maria should have safety net for the inevitable times she cannot function alone\n\n  Scenario: Oldest child becoming household partner without losing childhood\n    Given Maria's 14-year-old is becoming a genuine household contributor\n    And this is necessary given their circumstances\n    When the household_elohim tracks the teen's contributions\n    Then it should recognize his age-appropriate household help\n    And it should warn if he's taking on too much adult responsibility\n    And it should help Maria preserve his childhood while accepting necessary help\n    And it should prevent parentification while valuing legitimate contribution\n    And the protocol should navigate this concerning but realistic dynamic carefully\n\n  Scenario: Household maintenance with no partner to share repairs and tasks\n    Given Maria handles all household repairs, maintenance, and problem-solving alone\n    And she has limited time, money, and often limited technical knowledge\n    When household maintenance needs arise\n    Then the household_elohim should provide decision support for repairs\n    And it should help her evaluate DIY versus hiring professionals\n    And it should connect her to affordable service providers when needed\n    And it should coordinate with neighbors for skill-sharing and tool-borrowing\n    And Maria should have support for household maintenance without a partner\n\n  Scenario: Logistics coordination nightmare with three children's schedules\n    Given Maria coordinates school, after-school care, activities, appointments for three children\n    And she manages this alone while working full-time\n    When daily logistics need coordination\n    Then the household_elohim should integrate all schedules\n    And it should identify conflicts before they become crises\n    And it should suggest solutions for impossible timing situations\n    And it should coordinate with other parents for pickup/dropoff sharing\n    And Maria should have AI co-parent for logistical complexity\n\n  Scenario: Household resilience planning for single-adult vulnerability\n    Given Maria's household depends entirely on her continued functioning\n    And there's no backup adult if something happens to her\n    When the household_elohim assesses resilience\n    Then it should help Maria create emergency plans for if she's incapacitated\n    And it should identify emergency contacts for children\n    And it should coordinate with extended family or community for backup care\n    And it should ensure children know what to do in various emergencies\n    And Maria should have peace of mind that children will be cared for if she can't\n\n  Scenario: Bedtime routine for three different ages managed solo\n    Given Maria manages three different bedtime routines alone\n    And she handles 6-year-old's needs, 9-year-old's independence, and teen's later schedule\n    When evening household operations occur\n    Then the household_elohim should coordinate efficient bedtime sequences\n    And it should help Maria provide age-appropriate attention to each child\n    And it should prevent exhaustion from serial one-on-one bedtime needs\n    And it should preserve connection time with each child despite time constraints\n    And Maria should manage impossible evening demands with better coordination\n\n  Scenario: Household care tokens include supplements for single-parent resource constraints\n    Given Maria's household operates on severely limited income\n    And the Value Scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status\n    When household care tokens are calculated\n    Then Maria should receive care token supplements based on income level\n    And her single-parent status should qualify for enhanced support\n    And supplements should enable continued participation without financial barrier\n    And care economy should function as economic support system\n    And access should be dignified, never requiring means-tested humiliation\n",
