  "content": "Scenario: Preventing social isolation through neighborhood integration\n    Given solo parenting is profoundly isolating\n    And Maria has limited time and energy for social connection\n    When the neighborhood_elohim monitors Maria's social engagement\n    Then it should facilitate low-effort neighborhood social integration\n    And it should connect her to neighborhood gatherings and events\n    And it should enable participation without requiring excessive time or energy\n    And neighborhood should provide adult social connection Maria lacks from co-parent\n    And Maria should have accessible pathways to community membership despite constraints\n",
