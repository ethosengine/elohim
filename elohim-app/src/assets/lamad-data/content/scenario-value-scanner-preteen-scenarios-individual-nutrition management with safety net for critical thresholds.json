  "content": "Scenario: Nutrition management with safety net for critical thresholds\n    Given Marcus is responsible for his and Keisha's nutrition\n    And inadequate nutrition has serious consequences\n    When Marcus makes food choices over time\n    Then the personal_agent should track nutrition across meals and weeks\n    And the system should watch for nutrition falling below safe levels\n    And if nutrition drops below critical thresholds, adult intervention should be triggered\n    And Marcus should be supported in meeting nutritional needs\n    And the agent should proactively suggest nutritious affordable options\n    And safety nets should protect without undermining autonomy\n",
