  "content": "Scenario: Community recognizes preteen caregivers without exploitation\n    Given Marcus represents many young people with household responsibilities\n    And community should support rather than exploit young caregivers\n    When the community_elohim identifies preteen caregivers\n    Then it should channel appropriate support to these families\n    And it should prevent exploitation of children's labor\n    And it should work to reduce excessive burden on young people\n    And it should advocate for family support that makes Marcus's work unnecessary\n    And paradoxically, while recognizing his work, it should work toward making it optional\n    And care economy should support children while addressing systemic issues\n",
