Municipal Parent Advocacy for Children's Needs\n  As a parent in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the municipal governance layer\n  I want to influence municipal decisions affecting my children's wellbeing\n  So that city policies support children's safety, health, development, and opportunity\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the parent user is registered in the system\n    And the parent has linked their children's schools, routes, and activities\n    And the municipal governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Parent connects municipal budget to school funding\n    Given the municipality is finalizing annual budget priorities\n    And the parent doesn't understand how city budget affects schools\n    When the parent reviews Observer's municipal-education analysis\n    Then they see how city tax decisions impact school district funding\n    And understand library budget cuts reduce children's book access\n    And learn recreation spending affects afterschool program availability\n    And municipal decisions connect to children's educational resources\n    And parent advocacy expands to city-level budget priorities\n\n  Scenario: Parent challenges development affecting school capacity\n    Given a developer proposes 300-unit residential development\n    And claims it will \"strengthen the community and tax base\"\n    When the parent reviews Observer's school capacity analysis\n    Then they see 180 new students projected from the development\n    And learn the nearest elementary school is already over capacity\n    And understand no new school facilities are planned\n    And view developer's track record on past school impact promises\n    And can challenge development approval with child-impact data\n\n  Scenario: Parent advocates for safe routes to school infrastructure\n    Given the parent's child walks to school along unsafe streets\n    And lacks sidewalks and safe crossings for two blocks\n    When the parent reviews municipal transportation budget\n    Then they see $4M allocated for downtown streetscape improvements\n    And learn zero dollars budgeted for school route safety\n    And connect with other parents whose children walk same routes\n    And present coordinated testimony at city council meeting\n    And municipal infrastructure priorities include children's safety\n\n  Scenario: Parent tracks municipal library service commitments\n    Given the city council promised to restore library weekend hours\n    And the parent's children depend on library for homework and programs\n    When three months pass without weekend hours being restored\n    Then the Observer alerts parent about the broken commitment\n    And provides evidence from the original council promise\n    And shows which council members voted for the restoration\n    And parent can demand accountability for family-serving commitments\n    And municipal promises to families persist despite turnover\n\n  Scenario: Parent evaluates city's childcare infrastructure crisis\n    Given the parent struggles to find affordable childcare\n    And municipal zoning rules restrict home-based childcare\n    When the parent reviews Observer's childcare access analysis\n    Then they see municipality has 1 childcare slot per 4 children\n    And understand zoning restrictions reduce supply\n    And learn neighboring cities changed zoning to expand access\n    And discover other parents facing same childcare crisis\n    And parent advocacy targets municipal policy barriers\n\n  Scenario: Parent opposes park closure affecting children's play space\n    Given the municipality proposes closing neighborhood park\n    And selling land to developer \"to increase tax revenue\"\n    When the parent reviews Observer's park access analysis\n    Then they see this eliminates closest play space for 400 children\n    And understand remaining parks are across dangerous intersections\n    And view data on child physical activity and green space access\n    And connect with pediatricians concerned about children's health\n    And parent advocacy preserves children's play infrastructure\n\n  Scenario: Parent discovers coalition for youth recreation programs\n    Given municipal budget cuts threaten youth sports and rec programs\n    And the parent's child participates in city soccer league\n    When the Observer detects 180 parents whose children use these programs\n    Then parents form rapid coalition to defend youth programs\n    And present coordinated data on program participation and benefits\n    And show economic value of city programs vs private alternatives\n    And municipal budget priorities respond to organized parent power\n    And youth recreation programs are preserved\n\n  Scenario: Parent challenges traffic safety near schools\n    Given traffic speeds and volume near the school create danger\n    And the parent has witnessed multiple near-miss incidents\n    When the parent reviews Observer's traffic safety data\n    Then they see documented speeding violations near school hours\n    And learn which other schools have traffic calming measures\n    And understand city transportation department can install measures\n    And coordinate with school principal and other parents\n    And municipal traffic safety includes school zone protection\n\n  Scenario: Parent connects development pattern to school overcrowding\n    Given the parent's child attends chronically overcrowded school\n    And wonders why enrollment keeps increasing\n    When the parent reviews Observer's municipal development history\n    Then they see 5 major residential developments approved in 3 years\n    And learn developers paid minimal school impact fees\n    And understand city approved housing without ensuring school capacity\n    And systematic pattern of municipal decisions harming education becomes visible\n    And parent advocacy targets growth management policies\n\n  Scenario: Parent advocates for municipal climate action affecting children\n    Given extreme heat days close schools and cancel outdoor activities\n    And the parent worries about children's future climate impacts\n    When the parent reviews municipal climate adaptation plans\n    Then they see schools lack air conditioning for heat waves\n    And learn city has no strategy for protecting children's health\n    And understand children are most vulnerable to climate impacts\n    And connect with other parents concerned about children's futures\n    And municipal climate policy centers children's wellbeing and safety\n",
