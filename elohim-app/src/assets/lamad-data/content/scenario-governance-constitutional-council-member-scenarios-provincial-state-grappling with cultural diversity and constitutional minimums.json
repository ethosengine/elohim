  "content": "Scenario: Grappling with cultural diversity and constitutional minimums\n    Given appeal involves community with different cultural practices\n    And tension exists between cultural values and constitutional principles\n    When we deliberate on cultural context and universal minimums\n    Then we honor: legitimate cultural diversity\n    And we distinguish: variation from violations of human dignity\n    And we examine: if protocol accommodates cultural specificity\n    And we balance: universal minimums with cultural respect\n    And we avoid: both cultural imperialism and harmful relativism\n    And we create: precedent protecting pluralism within constitutional bounds\n    And we demonstrate: wisdom ordinary citizens bring to complex questions\n",
