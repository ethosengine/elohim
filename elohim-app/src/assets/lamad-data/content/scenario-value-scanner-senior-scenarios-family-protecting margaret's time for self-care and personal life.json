  "content": "Scenario: Protecting Margaret's time for self-care and personal life\n    Given Margaret's family depends on her care contributions\n    And she needs time for her own health and well-being\n    When the family_elohim monitors Margaret's time allocation\n    Then it should protect her time for personal needs\n    And it should flag when family demands encroach on self-care\n    And Margaret should be supported in setting boundaries\n    And family should understand that her care capacity requires self-care\n    And she should be encouraged to maintain her own friendships and interests\n    And the system should prevent family from consuming all her time\n",
