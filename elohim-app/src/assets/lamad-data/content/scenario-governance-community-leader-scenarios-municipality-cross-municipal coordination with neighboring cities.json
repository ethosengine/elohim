  "content": "Scenario: Cross-municipal coordination with neighboring cities\n    Given some challenges extend beyond Riverside boundaries\n    And watershed management affects multiple municipalities\n    When I coordinate with neighboring community leaders\n    Then we convene: inter-municipal deliberative assemblies\n    And agents from: different municipalities share analysis\n    And we negotiate: agreements serving all communities\n    And we respect: each municipality's sovereignty\n    And we find: synthesis through democratic deliberation\n    And lateral coordination: addresses problems that don't respect boundaries\n    And we demonstrate: governance working across jurisdictions\n",
