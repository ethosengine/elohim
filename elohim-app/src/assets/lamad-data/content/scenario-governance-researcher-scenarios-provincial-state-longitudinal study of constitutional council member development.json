  "content": "Scenario: Longitudinal study of Constitutional Council member development\n    Given I am tracking council members like Sarah over time\n    And I want to understand how service affects them\n    When I study council members before, during, and after service\n    Then I measure: constitutional literacy development\n    And I assess: deliberative skill acquisition\n    And I examine: civic confidence and participation changes\n    And I track: whether capabilities persist after service ends\n    And I explore: whether service affects children's civic development\n    And I analyze: whether sortition creates democratic capacity at population scale\n    And My research tests: whether citizen governance transforms citizens\n",
