  "content": "Scenario: Funding state grants for community protocol adoption\n    Given poor communities cannot afford protocol infrastructure\n    And equitable access requires public investment\n    When I secure state budget allocation for protocol support\n    Then I fund: grants for community nodes and maintenance\n    And I support: accessibility enhancements and education\n    And I provide: technical assistance for implementation\n    And I ensure: sliding scale and cross-subsidization\n    And I treat: protocol as democracy infrastructure deserving investment\n    And I prevent: digital divide excluding marginalized communities\n    And public funding: enables universal access to democratic governance tools\n",
