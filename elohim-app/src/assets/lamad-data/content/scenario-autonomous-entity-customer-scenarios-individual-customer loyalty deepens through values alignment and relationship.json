  "content": "Scenario: Customer loyalty deepens through values alignment and relationship\n    Given corporate loyalty was transactional (rewards programs) or habitual (convenience)\n    And Ms. Johnson's loyalty to ChickenMax was weak and circumstantial\n    When democratic ownership creates genuine basis for loyalty\n    Then loyalty comes from values alignment (supporting worker ownership)\n    And relationships with workers create emotional connection\n    And community commitment makes leaving feel like betraying neighbors\n    And loyalty is authentic, not manufactured through manipulation\n    And community_elohim tracks loyalty through retention, not surveillance rewards programs\n",
