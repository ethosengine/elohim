  "content": "Scenario: Contributing to aging parent care from distance\n    Given my parents are aging and need increasing support\n    And I work full-time with unpredictable schedule\n    And I cannot provide hands-on daily care\n    When the family coordinates parent care\n    Then the protocol should help me contribute within my capacity\n    And identify non-time-intensive ways I can support\n    And coordinate with siblings who may have different availability\n    And recognize my contributions even when limited by employment\n",
