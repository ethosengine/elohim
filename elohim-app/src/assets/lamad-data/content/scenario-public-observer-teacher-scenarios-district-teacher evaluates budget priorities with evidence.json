  "content": "Scenario: Teacher evaluates budget priorities with evidence\n    Given the district approved $2M for new administration positions\n    But rejected $800K for reducing class sizes\n    When the Observer makes budget trade-offs transparent\n    Then teachers see value priorities (administration vs instruction)\n    And calculate that rejected proposal would fund 16 teaching positions\n    And document that administrative overhead increased 40% in five years\n    And organize parents and community around budget priorities\n    And fiscal policy becomes professional accountability issue\n",
