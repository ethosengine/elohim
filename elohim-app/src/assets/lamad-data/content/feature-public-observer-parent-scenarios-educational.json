Education Policy Parent Advocacy\n  As a parent in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want to engage with education policy and school board decisions\n  So that my children's education serves their learning not bureaucratic convenience\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the parent user is registered in the system\n    And the parent has linked their children's schools and grade levels\n    And the educational governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Parent translates education-ese to real child impacts\n    Given the school board discusses \"instructional efficiency optimization\"\n    And the parent reviews meeting while child does homework\n    When the Observer translates the education jargon\n    Then the parent learns this means eliminating teaching assistants\n    And understands impact is class size increases from 24 to 32 students\n    And sees real effect on their child's individual attention\n    And can respond to actual impacts vs bureaucratic language\n    And education policy becomes accessible to working parents\n\n  Scenario: Parent participates in 15 minutes not 3 hours\n    Given the school board meets Tuesday at 7 PM for 3+ hours\n    And the parent has work shift, dinner, and bedtime routines\n    When the parent cannot attend the meeting in person\n    Then they receive 3-minute morning summary of decisions\n    And can submit questions and positions via mobile app\n    And get alert if their child's school is specifically affected\n    And review post-meeting summary with action items\n    And democracy fits into parent's actual available time\n\n  Scenario: Parent discovers teacher coalition on class size\n    Given the board proposes increasing class sizes to save money\n    And the parent opposes this for their child's learning\n    When the Observer shows teacher union position on class sizes\n    Then the parent sees teachers oppose increase for same reasons\n    And understands research on class size impacts on learning\n    And natural parent-teacher alliance against harmful policy becomes visible\n    And coordinated parent-teacher testimony defeats the proposal\n    And board cannot divide parents and teachers\n\n  Scenario: Parent tracks curriculum policy transparency\n    Given the school board discusses curriculum changes\n    And the parent wants to understand what their child will learn\n    When the parent reviews Observer's curriculum analysis\n    Then they see specific content being added or removed\n    And understand pedagogical approaches and their evidence base\n    And view teacher professional perspectives on the curriculum\n    And can evaluate changes based on child's learning needs\n    And curriculum decisions include parent informed input\n\n  Scenario: Parent challenges harmful discipline policies\n    Given the school implements zero-tolerance discipline policy\n    And the parent's child has been suspended for minor incident\n    When the parent reviews Observer's discipline data\n    Then they see suspension rates and disparate racial impacts\n    And learn about restorative justice alternatives\n    And discover other parents whose children face similar treatment\n    And understand policy alternatives from other districts\n    And parent coalition advocates for evidence-based discipline reform\n\n  Scenario: Parent exposes school resource inequities\n    Given the parent suspects their child's school gets fewer resources\n    And neighboring school seems to have more programs and facilities\n    When the parent reviews Observer's district equity analysis\n    Then they see per-student spending varies by thousands of dollars\n    And westside schools have gifted programs and experienced teachers\n    And their child's school lacks arts, music, and advanced courses\n    And systematic inequity pattern becomes documented evidence\n    And parent advocacy shifts to structural equity demands\n\n  Scenario: Parent evaluates school board candidate positions\n    Given school board election is approaching\n    And three candidates claim to \"support children and families\"\n    When the parent reviews Observer's candidate comparison\n    Then they see each candidate's voting record on key issues\n    And understand positions on class sizes, teacher pay, program funding\n    And view candidates' funding sources and potential conflicts\n    And can make informed vote in 15 minutes during lunch break\n    And parent participation strengthens education democracy\n\n  Scenario: Parent coordinates opposition to program cuts\n    Given the board proposes eliminating elementary music programs\n    And the parent's child participates in school band\n    When the Observer connects parents across district whose children affected\n    Then 230 families from 8 schools form coordinated coalition\n    And present unified testimony on music education benefits\n    And propose alternative budget cuts that preserve student programs\n    And district-wide parent power prevents program elimination\n    And children's enrichment programs are preserved\n\n  Scenario: Parent challenges state funding formula\n    Given the parent learns state funding shortchanges their district\n    And wonders why their child's school lacks basic resources\n    When the parent reviews Observer's state funding analysis\n    Then they see their district receives $3,000 less per student\n    And understand state formula creates massive inequities\n    And learn this explains overcrowded classes and cut programs\n    And connect with parents in other underfunded districts statewide\n    And parent advocacy expands to state-level funding reform\n\n  Scenario: Parent tracks special education compliance\n    Given the parent's child has IEP for learning disability\n    And required support services aren't being provided\n    When the parent reviews Observer's special education tracking\n    Then they see federal law mandates these services\n    And understand district is violating child's legal rights\n    And learn process for filing compliance complaint\n    And connect with other special education parents\n    And district cannot quietly violate disability rights\n\n  Scenario: Parent advocates for school safety investments\n    Given the parent worries about school safety and emergency preparedness\n    And board discusses \"safety measures\" in vague terms\n    When the parent reviews Observer's safety policy analysis\n    Then they see which safety measures are evidence-based vs security theater\n    And understand budget allocations for counselors vs surveillance\n    And learn about trauma-informed approaches to school safety\n    And can advocate for measures that actually protect children\n    And school safety policy centers student wellbeing not punishment\n\n  Scenario: Parent opposes standardized testing overload\n    Given the parent's child faces excessive standardized testing\n    And tests create stress without improving learning\n    When the parent reviews Observer's testing policy context\n    Then they see how many instructional days lost to testing\n    And understand which tests are federally required vs optional\n    And learn about opt-out policies and parent rights\n    And discover other parents concerned about testing burden\n    And parent coalition advocates for reducing unnecessary testing\n\n  Scenario: Parent tracks board accountability for promises\n    Given the school board promised to address transportation by Q2\n    And the parent's child still has unreliable dangerous bus service\n    When three months pass without action on the commitment\n    Then the Observer alerts parent about broken promise\n    And provides exact quote from February board meeting\n    And shows which board members made the commitment\n    And parent raises specific accountability question publicly\n    And board commitments to families persist despite turnover\n",
