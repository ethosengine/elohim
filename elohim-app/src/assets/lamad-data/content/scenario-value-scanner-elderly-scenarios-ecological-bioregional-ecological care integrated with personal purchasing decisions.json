  "content": "Scenario: Ecological care integrated with personal purchasing decisions\n    Given Helen uses Value Scanner for shopping\n    And her choices have environmental impact\n    When Helen makes purchasing decisions\n    Then ecological impact should be surfaced at appropriate cognitive level\n    And her personal_agent should support environmentally conscious choices\n    And information should be presented simply: \"Local tomatoes from nearby farm\"\n    And ecological care should be framed as care for community\n    And Helen should be supported in environmental stewardship within her capabilities\n    And the protocol should enable ecological values in daily decisions\n    And sustainability should be accessible regardless of cognitive limitations\n",
