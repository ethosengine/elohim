Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Preteen\n  As a preteen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want to understand how my food choices connect to ecological systems and care labor\n  So that I develop stewardship extending beyond my household to the land and people who feed us\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the preteen user \"Marcus\" is registered in the system\n    And Marcus is developing abstract thinking about systems\n    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active\n    And Marcus makes food decisions with real consequences\n    And care economy extends to ecological relationships\n\n  Scenario: Understanding food systems complexity through shopping\n    Given Marcus shops regularly and makes food choices\n    And food connects to complex agricultural and distribution systems\n    When Marcus scans food items\n    Then the personal_agent should surface information about food origins\n    And it should show where food comes from and who grows it\n    And it should explain care labor embedded in food production\n    And Marcus should learn that his choices connect to larger systems\n    And food system awareness should develop through practice\n    And ecological consciousness should build on care economy foundation\n\n  Scenario: Learning connection between budget constraints and farm labor\n    Given Marcus experiences severe budget constraints\n    And cheap food often reflects exploited farm labor\n    When Marcus chooses affordable foods\n    Then the personal_agent should help him understand pricing\n    And it should explain that low prices often mean low wages for workers\n    And it should build empathy for farm workers' care labor\n    And Marcus should understand his scarcity connects to their scarcity\n    And economic justice awareness should develop\n    And care economy should include care for food system workers\n\n  Scenario: Seasonal eating aligned with bioregional food production\n    Given seasonal local food is often more affordable\n    And Marcus needs to maximize his limited budget\n    When Marcus plans meals\n    Then the personal_agent should highlight seasonal options\n    And it should explain what grows locally in current season\n    And it should help him choose foods aligned with bioregional production\n    And economic and ecological goals should align\n    And he should learn that eating seasonally reduces costs and environmental impact\n    And bioregional awareness should develop through practical benefit\n\n  Scenario: Local food systems provide better value and freshness\n    Given Marcus shops in specific geographic region\n    And locally grown food can be cheaper and fresher\n    When Marcus compares food options\n    Then the personal_agent should identify local sources\n    And it should help him access farmers' markets and local growers\n    And it should explain benefits of shorter supply chains\n    And local food should be framed as both economic and ecological win\n    And he should learn that bioregional food systems serve his needs\n    And connection to local land and farmers should develop\n\n  Scenario: Understanding environmental impact of food choices\n    Given Marcus is developing capacity for abstract thinking\n    And environmental sustainability connects to care economy\n    When Marcus makes food choices\n    Then the personal_agent should provide age-appropriate environmental information\n    And it should explain ecological impact in concrete terms\n    And it should not overwhelm him with climate anxiety\n    And it should frame environmental care as extension of household care\n    And ecological literacy should develop alongside care economy principles\n    And stewardship should extend from family to bioregion\n\n  Scenario: Food waste reduction serves both budget and ecology\n    Given Marcus must maximize value from $75 budget\n    And food waste represents economic and ecological loss\n    When Marcus manages food inventory\n    Then the personal_agent should help him minimize waste\n    And it should track what gets used and what spoils\n    And it should suggest meal planning that uses ingredients completely\n    And waste reduction should serve both his budget and environment\n    And ecological stewardship should align with economic necessity\n    And care for resources should extend to caring for earth\n\n  Scenario: Connection to land through understanding food origins\n    Given Marcus eats food grown in soil by farmers\n    And connection to land is part of ecological literacy\n    When Marcus learns about his food sources\n    Then the personal_agent should teach bioregional geography\n    And it should help him understand local agricultural landscape\n    And it should build relationship between Marcus and the land feeding him\n    And he should develop sense of place and bioregional identity\n    And care economy should include care for ecological systems\n    And stewardship should extend beyond human relationships\n\n  Scenario: Learning sustainable farming practices benefit everyone\n    Given Marcus is developing systems thinking\n    And agricultural practices affect long-term food security\n    When Marcus learns about food production methods\n    Then the personal_agent should explain sustainable vs. extractive farming\n    And it should teach that care for soil creates long-term abundance\n    And it should connect farm stewardship to household stewardship\n    And he should understand that ecological care serves human flourishing\n    And sustainable agriculture should be framed through care economy\n    And his generation should expect farming that cares for land\n\n  Scenario: Urban food deserts as ecological and economic justice issue\n    Given Marcus may live in urban food desert\n    And food access connects to land use and economic systems\n    When Marcus experiences difficulty accessing fresh food\n    Then he should understand food deserts as systemic failure\n    And the personal_agent should explain how urban planning affects food access\n    And he should learn that food justice requires ecological and economic change\n    And his lived experience should inform political consciousness\n    And care economy should include bioregional food sovereignty\n    And his struggles should fuel commitment to food system transformation\n\n  Scenario: Water systems and food production understanding\n    Given food production requires water resources\n    And Marcus is learning about ecological systems\n    When Marcus learns about food origins\n    Then the personal_agent should teach about water in agriculture\n    And it should explain water footprint of different foods\n    And it should connect food choices to watershed health\n    And bioregional water systems should be part of his literacy\n    And he should understand water as precious resource\n    And care economy should include stewardship of water\n\n  Scenario: Future orientation toward food system transformation\n    Given Marcus experiences food system failures personally\n    And he is developing values and political consciousness\n    When Marcus reflects on food systems\n    Then he should envision better alternatives\n    And the personal_agent should present possibilities for transformation\n    And it should explain food sovereignty and community agriculture\n    And his generation should expect fundamental food system change\n    And care economy should provide framework for reimagining food systems\n    And his current struggles should fuel commitment to creating just alternatives\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional food networks could serve families like Marcus's\n    Given Marcus's family struggles with food budget\n    And bioregional food networks could provide affordable access\n    When the community_elohim identifies bioregional opportunities\n    Then it should connect Marcus to local food networks\n    And it should help him access CSA programs, food cooperatives, gleaning\n    And bioregional connection should reduce his economic burden\n    And local food systems should serve food security goals\n    And care economy should operate at bioregional scale\n    And connection to land and farmers should benefit all parties\n\n  Scenario: Climate change impacts on food systems understood concretely\n    Given climate change affects food production and prices\n    And Marcus experiences food cost volatility\n    When Marcus encounters price fluctuations\n    Then the personal_agent should explain climate impacts on agriculture\n    And it should connect extreme weather to food availability\n    And climate education should be grounded in lived experience\n    And he should understand climate as care economy issue\n    And ecological crisis should be framed as requiring care-based response\n    And his generation should be prepared to steward through climate chaos\n",
