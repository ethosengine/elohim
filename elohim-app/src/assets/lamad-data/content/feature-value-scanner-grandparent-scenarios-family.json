Family Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent\n  As a grandparent coordinating care across three generations\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want multigenerational care relationships to be visible and reciprocal\n  So that family care economy flows equitably across generations\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the grandparent user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret's family includes her daughter Sarah and grandchildren Tommy (5) and Emma (8)\n    And Margaret's family also includes her 92-year-old mother\n    And Margaret provides 25 hours/week childcare for Sarah's children\n    And Margaret also coordinates care for her elderly mother\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy\n\n  Scenario: Grandparent care contributions visible to entire family\n    Given Margaret provides substantial childcare for Sarah's family\n    And her care work saves Sarah ~$1,500/month in childcare costs\n    When the family_elohim tracks Margaret's care contributions\n    Then Sarah should see quantified value of Margaret's labor\n    And the grandchildren should learn that grandma provides valuable work\n    And the full family should recognize Margaret's contributions\n    And visibility should enable family-wide appreciation\n    And Margaret's labor should be valued, not taken for granted\n    And care tokens should accumulate for her substantial work\n    And family should understand her economic and developmental contribution\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating with parental authority while maintaining grandparent role\n    Given Sarah is the parent with primary authority over children\n    And Margaret needs to honor Sarah's parenting choices\n    When the family_elohim coordinates care boundaries\n    Then it should help Margaret align with Sarah's values and rules\n    And it should preserve Margaret's unique grandparent identity\n    And it should navigate between parental authority and grandparent autonomy\n    And Margaret should not be subordinate (taking orders) or superior (overriding choices)\n    And family_elohim should help them work as partners in child-rearing\n    And relationship should be mutually respectful and collaborative\n    And complex multigenerational dynamics should be coordinated skillfully\n\n  Scenario: Teaching grandchildren care economy values and principles\n    Given Margaret is modeling care economy through her actions\n    And Tommy and Emma are learning from her example\n    When Margaret provides care and teaches family values\n    Then the family_elohim should support intergenerational value transmission\n    And children should learn that care creates value\n    And they should see that elders have wisdom and worth\n    And they should understand families are reciprocal care networks\n    And Margaret's care teaching should be recognized as developmental work\n    And next generation should internalize care economy principles\n    And family culture should be transformed through children's learning\n\n  Scenario: Margaret's own elder care work made visible to family\n    Given Margaret coordinates care for her 92-year-old mother\n    And she navigates \"sandwich generation\" care obligations\n    When the family_elohim tracks Margaret's elder care\n    Then it should recognize this as substantial care labor\n    And it should show Margaret is caring across three generations\n    And Sarah should see Margaret's total care burden\n    And grandchildren should see Margaret modeling elder care\n    And elder care should accumulate care tokens alongside grandparenting\n    And family should understand Margaret's comprehensive care work\n    And her care for her own mother should be visible and valued\n\n  Scenario: Reciprocal care flows across three generations\n    Given Margaret receives some support from Sarah as she ages\n    And Margaret provides childcare for Sarah's children\n    And Margaret provides elder care for her own mother\n    When the family_elohim analyzes multigenerational care patterns\n    Then it should show care flowing in multiple directions\n    And it should ensure care is not unidirectionally extractive\n    And it should recognize reciprocity across time and generations\n    And family relationships should be based on mutual support\n    And care economy should be sustainable across generations\n    And the system should enable healthy multigenerational care patterns\n\n  Scenario: Family decision-making about care arrangements and boundaries\n    Given care arrangements affect multiple family members\n    And boundaries need to be negotiated and maintained\n    When the family discusses care commitments and changes\n    Then the family_elohim should facilitate clear communication\n    And it should help family make decisions that respect all members\n    And Margaret's capacity and boundaries should be honored\n    And Sarah's parenting authority should be respected\n    And care arrangements should be mutually agreed upon\n    And family governance should be participatory and equitable\n    And decisions should serve the flourishing of all generations\n\n  Scenario: Grandchildren learning to value elders through relationship\n    Given Margaret's care work builds deep bonds with grandchildren\n    And she teaches them to respect and value older adults\n    When Tommy and Emma interact with Margaret over years\n    Then the family_elohim should track relationship development\n    And it should recognize Margaret's role in shaping their attitudes toward elders\n    And children should learn that aging doesn't diminish worth\n    And they should see Margaret as capable, wise, and valuable\n    And this learning will matter when Margaret needs care herself\n    And next generation is being prepared to value and care for elders\n    And intergenerational relationships should be mutually enriching\n\n  Scenario: Preventing exploitation of grandparent care labor\n    Given Margaret provides substantial unpaid care\n    And she could potentially be taken advantage of\n    When the family_elohim monitors care economy equity\n    Then it should flag if Margaret's contributions are excessive relative to reciprocity\n    And it should prevent family from treating her as \"free childcare\"\n    And it should ensure her care work is appreciated and valued\n    And it should help family recognize when to compensate or reciprocate\n    And Margaret should have standing to set boundaries\n    And care economy should protect grandparents from exploitation\n    And family relationships should be equitable, not extractive\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating between Margaret's household and Sarah's household\n    Given Margaret has her own household with Robert\n    And Sarah has her household with her own governance\n    When the family_elohim coordinates across households\n    Then it should respect both household autonomies\n    And it should help negotiate care arrangements between households\n    And it should coordinate schedules, logistics, and expectations\n    And boundaries between households should be clear and respected\n    And neither household should dominate the other\n    And care coordination should serve both households' needs\n    And multigenerational care should work across household boundaries\n\n  Scenario: Family cultural and value transmission through grandparenting\n    Given Margaret carries family history, traditions, and values\n    And she teaches these to grandchildren through care relationship\n    When the family_elohim tracks cultural transmission\n    Then it should recognize this as valuable family work\n    And it should support Margaret's role as family culture keeper\n    And it should value intergenerational wisdom sharing\n    And cultural education should be recognized as care labor\n    And family identity should be strengthened across generations\n    And Margaret's teaching should be appreciated and supported\n\n  Scenario: Supporting Sarah's work and life through care provision\n    Given Margaret's childcare enables Sarah to work and thrive\n    And this support is essential to Sarah's economic security\n    When the family_elohim tracks how care enables flourishing\n    Then it should show that Margaret's care supports Sarah's career\n    And it should recognize care as infrastructure for Sarah's life\n    And it should make visible that Margaret enables Sarah's economic participation\n    And multigenerational care should enable all generations to thrive\n    And Margaret's contribution to Sarah's flourishing should be recognized\n    And care economy should show how generations support each other\n\n  Scenario: Family care legacy and preparing for Margaret's own aging\n    Given Margaret is building care economy capital through current contributions\n    And she will need increasing care as she ages\n    When the family_elohim tracks care patterns across time\n    Then it should show Margaret's accumulated care contributions\n    And it should recognize she is building reciprocal relationships\n    And it should help family understand care flows across life stages\n    And grandchildren learning now will be caregivers later\n    And Sarah will reciprocate care as Margaret ages\n    And family care economy should be sustainable across time\n    And Margaret's current care should create future care security\n",
