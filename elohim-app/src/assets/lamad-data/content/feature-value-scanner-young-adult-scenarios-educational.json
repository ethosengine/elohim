Educational Layer Value Literacy for Young Adult\n  As a young adult continuing my education and development\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want to learn practical life skills and develop capabilities\n  So that I build competence for lifelong flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the young_adult user \"Aisha\" is registered in the system\n    And Aisha is 23 years old in early independence\n    And formal education didn't teach household management skills\n    And the educational governance context is active\n    And lifelong learning is essential for adult life\n    And the Value Scanner serves as practical education system\n\n  Scenario: Learning household management skills not taught in formal education\n    Given Aisha's college education didn't include life skills\n    And she needs practical household management capabilities\n    When Aisha uses the Value Scanner educational features\n    Then the personal_agent should teach grocery shopping efficiency\n    And it should provide meal planning education\n    And it should teach nutrition basics within budget constraints\n    And it should explain waste reduction strategies\n    And practical life skills should be taught through direct application\n    And education should fill gaps from formal schooling\n\n  Scenario: Building financial literacy through practice with support\n    Given Aisha received minimal financial education\n    And she's learning money management with real stakes\n    When Aisha makes financial decisions in the scanner\n    Then the personal_agent should provide contextual financial education\n    And it should teach budgeting through actual practice\n    And it should explain concepts like opportunity cost\n    And it should help her understand efficiency frontiers\n    And financial literacy should build through supported real-world decisions\n    And mistakes should be learning opportunities, not catastrophes\n\n  Scenario: Nutrition education integrated with shopping decisions\n    Given Aisha wants to eat healthfully\n    And she has limited nutrition knowledge\n    When Aisha selects food items\n    Then the personal_agent should provide nutrition education\n    And it should explain nutritional value of options\n    And it should teach balancing nutrition with budget\n    And it should help her understand dietary needs\n    And learning should integrate seamlessly with decision-making\n    And nutrition literacy should develop through practice\n\n  Scenario: Learning cooking skills progressively through recipe suggestions\n    Given Aisha has minimal cooking experience\n    And she wants to develop culinary capability\n    When the personal_agent suggests recipes\n    Then recommendations should match her current skill level\n    And difficulty should increase gradually as she learns\n    And it should teach techniques through practice\n    And it should explain why certain methods work\n    And cooking education should be progressive and achievable\n    And she should build confidence and competence incrementally\n\n  Scenario: Understanding value creation through care economy education\n    Given traditional economics education emphasizes market transactions\n    And Aisha is learning care economy principles\n    When the personal_agent teaches value concepts\n    Then it should explain how care creates value\n    And it should teach that invisible work is valuable\n    And it should explain care token economics\n    And it should help her understand reciprocal care systems\n    And care economy literacy should provide alternative to market capitalism\n    And foundational economic understanding should center care\n\n  Scenario: Learning from mistakes without shame or judgment\n    Given Aisha will make errors as she learns\n    And learning requires safe failure\n    When Aisha makes suboptimal decisions\n    Then the personal_agent should provide constructive feedback\n    And it should explain what happened and why\n    And it should suggest better approaches for future\n    And feedback should be educational, never judgmental\n    And mistakes should be treated as learning opportunities\n    And the system should create psychologically safe learning environment\n\n  Scenario: Developing critical thinking about consumption and marketing\n    Given consumer marketing targets young adults intensively\n    And Aisha needs media literacy\n    When Aisha encounters marketing messages\n    Then the personal_agent should help her think critically\n    And it should explain marketing tactics and manipulation\n    And it should teach distinguishing needs from manufactured wants\n    And consumer education should support autonomous decision-making\n    And she should learn to resist exploitative marketing\n    And critical consumption literacy should be developed\n\n  Scenario: Educational resources for continuing professional development\n    Given adult learning is lifelong\n    And Aisha wants professional skill development\n    When Aisha seeks professional education\n    Then the personal_agent should surface relevant learning resources\n    And it should connect her to workshops, courses, or certifications\n    And it should help her plan skill development trajectory\n    And professional education should be accessible and affordable\n    And the system should support continuous capability building\n    And career growth should be facilitated through education access\n\n  Scenario: Learning sustainable practices within budget constraints\n    Given Aisha wants to be environmentally responsible\n    And she has limited financial resources\n    When the personal_agent teaches sustainability\n    Then education should address real budget limitations\n    And it should teach affordable sustainable practices\n    And it should explain trade-offs between cost and environmental impact\n    And sustainability education should be practical, not preachy\n    And she should learn to make values-aligned choices within constraints\n    And environmental literacy should respect economic reality\n\n  Scenario: Peer learning networks facilitated through care economy\n    Given young adults learn effectively from peers\n    And Aisha's peers face similar challenges\n    When Aisha connects with peers through the system\n    Then the personal_agent should facilitate peer learning\n    And it should enable knowledge exchange among young adults\n    And it should coordinate peer teaching and support\n    And collective learning should be more effective than isolated struggle\n    And peer networks should be educational resources\n    And mutual learning should strengthen community\n\n  Scenario: Teaching healthy boundary-setting and self-advocacy\n    Given Aisha needs to learn professional and personal boundaries\n    And boundary-setting is rarely taught explicitly\n    When the personal_agent provides guidance\n    Then it should teach how to set healthy boundaries\n    And it should model self-advocacy language and approaches\n    And it should help her recognize when boundaries are needed\n    And the system should educate about sustainable capacity management\n    And she should learn that boundaries enable sustainable care\n    And self-advocacy should be taught as essential life skill\n\n  Scenario: Learning value literacy through concrete application\n    Given abstract economic theory is less effective than practice\n    And Aisha learns best through direct experience\n    When Aisha uses the Value Scanner\n    Then value education should happen through application\n    And concepts should be taught in context of real decisions\n    And theory should emerge from practice\n    And learning should be concrete and immediately applicable\n    And value literacy should develop through lived experience\n    And education should be embodied, not abstract\n\n  Scenario: Access to mentoring and guidance from experienced adults\n    Given Aisha can benefit from elder wisdom\n    And mentoring relationships support development\n    When Aisha seeks guidance\n    Then the system should connect her to mentors\n    And it should facilitate intergenerational knowledge transfer\n    And experienced adults should share practical wisdom\n    And mentoring should be valued as care work\n    And the educational layer should include relationship-based learning\n    And she should have access to guidance beyond peer knowledge\n\n  Scenario: Educational privacy protects learning data from exploitation\n    Given Aisha's learning patterns generate valuable data\n    And educational data is often exploited commercially\n    When educational data is collected\n    Then it must be used only to improve educational outcomes\n    And Aisha's privacy must be absolutely protected\n    And no commercial exploitation of learning data should occur\n    And data should serve her learning, not surveillance capitalism\n    And educational privacy must be maintained\n    And learning should never be monetized\n",
