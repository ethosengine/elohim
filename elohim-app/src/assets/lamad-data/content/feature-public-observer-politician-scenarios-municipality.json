Municipal Governance for Elected Representative\n  As a politician in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the municipality governance layer\n  I want to understand constituent needs and make informed decisions\n  So that I can genuinely represent my community despite information asymmetry and capture pressures\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the politician user is registered in the system\n    And the municipality governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Council member surfaces constituent intelligence at scale\n    Given the politician represents 50,000 residents\n    And only 20 constituents typically attend council meetings\n    When the Observer aggregates constituent patterns from civic engagement\n    Then the politician sees 230 families losing 90 minutes daily to bus delays\n    And identifies senior centers underutilized due to access barriers\n    And learns small businesses struggle with permit complexity\n    And hears from working parents and shift workers who can't attend meetings\n    And understands actual constituent needs beyond loudest voices\n\n  Scenario: Mayor evaluates development proposal with comprehensive impact analysis\n    Given a developer proposes mixed-use project with rosy projections\n    And activists present worst-case scenarios in opposition\n    When the politician requests Observer impact analysis\n    Then they see developer's track record on past projects in other cities\n    And review infrastructure capacity data (traffic, water, schools)\n    And understand economic benefits distribution (jobs for whom, tax revenue timing)\n    And identify community costs and trade-offs objectively\n    And make informed decision beyond political calculations\n\n  Scenario: Council member tracks accountability commitments systematically\n    Given the politician made campaign promises to constituents\n    And committed to specific actions in community meetings\n    When the Observer monitors commitment tracking\n    Then they receive alerts when deadlines approach\n    And see status of all promises made across forums\n    And get nudges to follow through on community pledges\n    And build constituent trust through documented delivery\n    And maintain integrity against overwhelming office demands\n\n  Scenario: Council member distinguishes grassroots from astroturf campaign\n    Given the politician receives flood of emails opposing rent control\n    And campaigns look like authentic constituent concern\n    When the Observer analyzes communication patterns\n    Then they see template messages from industry lobbying firm\n    And identify coordinated timing and identical language\n    And distinguish 5 genuine constituent concerns from 200 manufactured messages\n    And understand actual constituent sentiment versus manipulation\n    And make decisions based on real community needs\n\n  Scenario: Mayor builds coalition for affordable housing initiative\n    Given the politician champions affordable housing policy\n    And needs support from diverse stakeholders\n    When the Observer surfaces coalition potential\n    Then they see tenant organizations share policy interest\n    And identify labor unions, faith communities, and senior advocates as allies\n    And facilitate bringing stakeholders to table for policy design\n    And track negotiation positions and evolution\n    And build multi-stakeholder coalition for policy passage\n\n  Scenario: Council member exposes budget priorities misaligned with constituent needs\n    Given the politician suspects budget doesn't reflect community priorities\n    When the Observer analyzes municipal spending patterns\n    Then they see infrastructure investment concentrated in affluent neighborhoods\n    And identify underinvestment in working-class areas\n    And calculate service delivery disparities by district\n    And present evidence-based budget amendments\n    And advocate for equitable resource distribution\n\n  Scenario: Mayor verifies lobbyist claims with independent evidence\n    Given business lobbyists claim regulations will kill jobs\n    And present alarming economic projections\n    When the Observer fact-checks lobbying claims\n    Then they see similar regulations in comparable cities\n    And review actual economic impacts versus predicted disasters\n    And identify which lobbyist projections proved accurate historically\n    And evaluate claims against track record\n    And resist manipulation through evidence-based analysis\n\n  Scenario: Council member understands constituent priorities across diverse neighborhoods\n    Given the politician represents economically and ethnically diverse district\n    And different communities have different needs\n    When the Observer aggregates constituent sentiment\n    Then they see working parents prioritize after-school programs\n    And learn seniors need meal delivery and transit access\n    And understand immigrant communities face language barriers in services\n    And identify disabled residents struggle with accessibility\n    And balance diverse constituent needs in policy positions\n\n  Scenario: Mayor monitors policy implementation against intended outcomes\n    Given the politician voted for homelessness intervention program\n    And expected specific outcomes from policy\n    When the Observer tracks implementation\n    Then they see which programs launched versus stalled\n    And learn actual outcomes compared to projections\n    And identify bureaucratic barriers to implementation\n    And intervene to align execution with legislative intent\n    And ensure votes translate to real community impact\n\n  Scenario: Council member faces developer donation pressure with transparency\n    Given the politician received campaign contributions from developers\n    And developer seeks vote on controversial project\n    When the Observer documents the relationship publicly\n    Then they see their campaign finance connections made visible\n    And understand constituents can track voting patterns\n    And face accountability for aligning votes with donors versus community\n    And navigate pressure with transparent decision-making\n    And explain vote rationale with evidence regardless of decision\n",
