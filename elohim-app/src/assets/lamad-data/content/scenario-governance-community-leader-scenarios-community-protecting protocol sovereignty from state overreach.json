  "content": "Scenario: Protecting protocol sovereignty from state overreach\n    Given state government attempts regulation compromising protocol\n    And I believe this violates community sovereignty\n    When I advocate for protecting local autonomy\n    Then I testify: at state legislative hearings\n    And I coalition: with other community leaders\n    And I present: evidence that regulation would harm local governance\n    And I defend: subsidiarity principle and community choice\n    And I resist: one-size-fits-all mandates from higher layers\n    And I maintain: that communities adopted protocol voluntarily\n    And I protect: democratic self-governance\n",
