Educational Layer Value Literacy for Adult\n  As an adult educator and parent\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want to teach value literacy to the next generation\n  So that children grow up understanding care creates value\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the adult user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah works as a teacher professionally\n    And Sarah is mother to Tommy (5) and Emma (8)\n    And the educational governance context is active\n    And the educational_elohim coordinates value literacy education\n    And Sarah operates as both professional educator and parent educator\n\n  Scenario: Professional teaching work recognized as care labor\n    Given Sarah works full-time as a teacher\n    And education is one of society's most important care functions\n    When Sarah's professional work is tracked in care economy\n    Then teaching should be recognized as care labor\n    And the educational_elohim should quantify Sarah's care contributions to students\n    And professional education should be valued alongside household care\n    And Sarah should see her career as care work, not separate from care economy\n    And teaching should be explicitly valued as caring for next generation\n\n  Scenario: Teaching value literacy to own children through Value Scanner\n    Given Sarah is raising Tommy (5) and Emma (8)\n    And she wants them to learn care economy principles\n    When Sarah uses the Value Scanner with her children\n    Then she should model value literacy through her actions\n    And Tommy should learn at developmentally appropriate level (wonder-preservation)\n    And Emma should learn at her developmental stage (guided autonomy)\n    And the educational_elohim should support Sarah's teaching\n    And children should internalize care creates value through family practice\n\n  Scenario: Integrating care economy principles into classroom teaching\n    Given Sarah teaches in a traditional school system\n    And she wants to bring care economy into curriculum\n    When Sarah designs lessons for her students\n    Then the educational_elohim should provide age-appropriate resources\n    And she should teach that care work creates value\n    And students should learn through concrete experiences\n    And classroom should become care economy learning environment\n    And Sarah should spread care economy principles to hundreds of children\n\n  Scenario: Educational policy shaped by teacher care work advocacy\n    Given Sarah has deep knowledge of educational needs from professional experience\n    And education policy affects her capacity to care for students\n    When educational policy decisions are made\n    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her voice\n    And teacher advocacy should be strengthened by care economy data\n    And policy should reflect actual educator experiences\n    And care economy should empower teacher voice in education governance\n    And those who do care work should shape care work policy\n\n  Scenario: Preventing teacher burnout through care economy recognition\n    Given Sarah faces high burnout risk as teacher\n    And teacher care work is undervalued and underpaid\n    When the educational_elohim tracks Sarah's teaching labor\n    Then her care contributions should be quantified and visible\n    And she should gain language to advocate for fair compensation\n    And recognition should support her professional sustainability\n    And care economy should help prevent teacher burnout\n    And visibility should enable Sarah to maintain teaching career\n\n  Scenario: Adult learning about care economy through practice and reflection\n    Given Sarah is learning care economy principles while teaching them\n    And adult learning happens through experience and reflection\n    When Sarah uses the Value Scanner over time\n    Then she should deepen her own value literacy continuously\n    And the educational_elohim should support her learning journey\n    And she should gain insights from teaching children\n    And her understanding should evolve through practice\n    And adults should learn care economy alongside children\n\n  Scenario: Educational resources for parents teaching value literacy\n    Given Sarah wants to teach value literacy effectively\n    And she needs pedagogical support for home education\n    When Sarah accesses educational resources\n    Then the educational_elohim should provide parent education materials\n    And resources should be developmentally appropriate for different ages\n    And guidance should help Sarah teach Tommy differently than Emma\n    And Sarah should have tools to be effective value literacy educator\n    And parent education should be supported systematically\n\n  Scenario: Multigenerational value literacy education within families\n    Given Sarah is teaching her children\n    And she's learning from her parents' care wisdom\n    And multiple generations participate in value education\n    When family engages in value literacy learning\n    Then the educational_elohim should coordinate across generations\n    And grandparents' care knowledge should be honored\n    And parents should teach children while still learning themselves\n    And value literacy should be transmitted across generations\n    And family should be primary educational site for care economy\n\n  Scenario: Educational assessment measures value literacy development\n    Given Sarah wants to know if children are learning value literacy\n    And assessment can support or undermine learning\n    When children's value literacy is assessed\n    Then the educational_elohim should measure care-based decision making\n    And assessment should observe whether children see care as valuable\n    And it should track development of care economy principles\n    And assessment should support learning, not create anxiety\n    And Sarah should see children's value literacy growth over time\n\n  Scenario: Professional development for educators in care economy teaching\n    Given Sarah wants to bring care economy into classroom\n    And she needs professional development support\n    When Sarah seeks educator training\n    Then the educational_elohim should provide professional development\n    And training should help teachers integrate care economy into curriculum\n    And it should respect existing teaching expertise\n    And it should provide practical classroom strategies\n    And Sarah should be equipped to teach care economy effectively\n\n  Scenario: Educational materials culturally responsive to diverse families\n    Given Sarah teaches students from diverse cultural backgrounds\n    And her own children are learning family cultural values\n    When educational materials are designed\n    Then the educational_elohim should provide culturally diverse resources\n    And materials should respect different care economy traditions\n    And Sarah should be able to adapt to cultural contexts\n    And value literacy should be taught in culturally responsive ways\n    And diverse approaches to care should be honored in education\n\n  Scenario: Educational governance includes parent and teacher voices\n    Given Sarah is both parent and teacher\n    And educational governance affects her professionally and personally\n    When educational policy decisions are made\n    Then Sarah should have voice from both perspectives\n    And parent care contributions should influence school policy\n    And teacher care contributions should shape education governance\n    And educational democracy should include those who do education care work\n    And Sarah's dual perspective should be valued in governance\n\n  Scenario: Next generation grows up assuming care economy is normal\n    Given Sarah is teaching value literacy to many children\n    And children form baseline expectations from early experience\n    When children who learn care economy reach adulthood\n    Then they should assume care work creates value\n    And they should expect care to be visible and recognized\n    And they should see care economy as normal, not alternative\n    And Sarah's teaching should transform next generation's economic understanding\n    And cultural transformation should happen through education\n",
