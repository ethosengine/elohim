Household Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities\n  As a person with disabilities managing an independent household with support\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want to maintain full authority over my household while coordinating needed assistance\n  So that I can live independently with dignity, managing my home as I choose\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the person_with_disabilities user \"Alex\" is registered in the system\n    And Alex lives independently in their own household\n    And Alex has cerebral palsy affecting mobility and fine motor control\n    And Alex coordinates support workers for specific assistance needs\n    And Alex's household operates on approximately $35k/year budget\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And the household_elohim coordinates Alex's household care economy\n    And Alex maintains full decision-making authority over household\n\n  Scenario: Alex maintains complete authority as household manager\n    Given Alex coordinates support workers for physical assistance\n    And some might assume support workers are in charge\n    When household decisions need to be made\n    Then Alex should have absolute authority over all household choices\n    And support workers should provide services Alex directs\n    And the household_elohim should structure Alex as employer/coordinator\n    And Alex's autonomy should be protected systematically\n    And the relationship should be professional partnership, not caretaking\n    And Alex should never be treated as passive recipient of care\n    And the protocol should embody Alex's household sovereignty\n\n  Scenario: Accessible grocery shopping with delivery coordination\n    Given Alex uses the Value Scanner for meal planning and shopping\n    And Alex cannot easily transport heavy grocery items\n    When Alex completes weekly shopping\n    Then the system should coordinate delivery seamlessly\n    And Alex should be able to schedule delivery to match their availability\n    And heavy items should be handled by support workers or delivery staff\n    And Alex should maintain control over product selection\n    And delivery should be dignified, not framed as special accommodation\n    And the process should be as efficient as able-bodied shopping\n    And Alex should have equal access to all products and options\n\n  Scenario: Meal planning adapted to Alex's preparation capabilities\n    Given Alex has specific constraints around meal preparation\n    And some physical tasks are difficult or impossible without assistance\n    When Alex plans weekly meals\n    Then the household_elohim should suggest meals within Alex's capabilities\n    And it should account for what Alex can prepare independently\n    And it should coordinate support worker assistance for complex prep\n    And nutritional needs should be met within preparation constraints\n    And meal planning should feel empowering, not limiting\n    And Alex should maintain choice over their food and nutrition\n    And adaptations should expand options, not restrict them\n\n  Scenario: Household budget management on combined disability benefits and part-time income\n    Given Alex's household operates on $35k/year\n    And income comes from part-time employment and disability benefits\n    When Alex manages household budget\n    Then the household_elohim should track spending against limited resources\n    And it should help Alex prioritize essential expenses\n    And disability-related costs (equipment, support services, medical) should be factored in\n    And Alex should be able to make informed financial decisions\n    And budget tools should respect Alex's competence in managing money\n    And the system should support Alex's financial autonomy\n    And resource constraints should be managed with dignity\n\n  Scenario: Support worker scheduling coordinated efficiently\n    Given Alex requires assistance with specific physical tasks\n    And support workers have their own schedules\n    When Alex needs to coordinate support services\n    Then the household_elohim should help schedule support worker visits efficiently\n    And it should match Alex's needs with worker availability\n    And Alex should be able to communicate requirements clearly\n    And schedule changes should be accommodated flexibly\n    And coordination should reduce Alex's cognitive load\n    And Alex should maintain authority over when and how support is provided\n    And the system should serve Alex's independence, not create dependence\n\n  Scenario: Household maintenance coordinated with accessibility considerations\n    Given Alex's household requires regular maintenance\n    And some maintenance tasks are physically inaccessible to Alex\n    When household maintenance needs arise\n    Then the household_elohim should help Alex coordinate necessary services\n    And it should identify which tasks need external assistance\n    And it should help Alex hire appropriate service providers\n    And Alex should maintain authority over what work is done and how\n    And service providers should respect Alex's expertise about their own home\n    And coordination should be efficient and dignity-preserving\n    And Alex should be able to maintain their home independently with appropriate support\n\n  Scenario: Household care token accumulation includes Alex's contributions\n    Given Alex participates in care token economy\n    And Alex contributes to household through management and coordination\n    When household care tokens are calculated\n    Then Alex's household management labor should be valued appropriately\n    And Alex's cognitive work of coordinating support should count\n    And care tokens should accumulate from Alex's contributions\n    And Alex should receive care token supplements based on household income level\n    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status\n    And Alex should be positioned as contributor, not just recipient\n    And economic standing should reflect Alex's actual care work\n\n  Scenario: Household technology adapted for Alex's accessibility needs\n    Given Alex's household includes various technologies\n    And accessibility is essential for Alex's independence\n    When Alex manages household systems\n    Then all household technology should be accessible to Alex\n    And the household_elohim should integrate with accessible smart home systems\n    And Alex should be able to control environment through voice or other accessible means\n    And technology should reduce barriers, not create them\n    And universal design principles should guide all technology choices\n    And Alex should have equal or better access than non-disabled people\n    And technology should serve Alex's independence\n\n  Scenario: Emergency preparedness accounts for Alex's specific needs\n    Given Alex has disability-related emergency considerations\n    And emergencies require rapid response\n    When the household_elohim plans for emergency scenarios\n    Then emergency plans should account for Alex's mobility limitations\n    And evacuation plans should be accessible to Alex\n    And medical equipment needs should be factored into emergency supplies\n    And support worker backup plans should be established\n    And Alex should have accessible emergency communication methods\n    And emergency preparedness should reduce Alex's vulnerability\n    And planning should be proactive, not reactive\n\n  Scenario: Household privacy protected from service providers\n    Given support workers and service providers enter Alex's household\n    And this creates potential privacy vulnerabilities\n    When household data is collected\n    Then Alex should control what household information is shared with service providers\n    And support workers should access only information necessary for their tasks\n    And Alex's medical and personal information should remain private\n    And household patterns should not be shared without Alex's consent\n    And the household_elohim should protect Alex's privacy systematically\n    And Alex should feel secure in their own home\n    And privacy protections should be robust even with frequent visitors\n\n  Scenario: Household care economy visible to counter narrative of burden\n    Given society often frames disabled people as burdens on households\n    And Alex contributes substantial household labor\n    When household care contributions are displayed\n    Then Alex's management, coordination, and decision-making should be visible\n    And the household_elohim should quantify Alex's cognitive and emotional labor\n    And data should counter the narrative that Alex is dependent burden\n    And Alex should see themselves as household contributor\n    And visibility should shift cultural understanding of disability and contribution\n    And the protocol should make Alex's care work undeniable\n    And Alex should experience affirmation of their household value\n\n  Scenario: Accessible household coordination reduces disability-related stress\n    Given navigating household management with disability is inherently stressful\n    And inaccessible systems compound that stress\n    When the household_elohim coordinates household functions\n    Then it should actively reduce Alex's cognitive load\n    And it should prevent accessibility barriers from becoming crises\n    And it should provide gentle reminders and support\n    And coordination should feel like genuine assistance\n    And Alex should experience less stress, not more\n    And the protocol should recognize that accessibility reduces disability\n    And good design should make Alex's household management easier than current systems\n",
