  "content": "Scenario: Building cross-disability solidarity across different disability communities\n    Given disability community includes diverse disabilities and experiences\n    And Alex works to build solidarity across different disability groups\n    When Alex bridges different disability communities\n    Then coalition-building should be recognized as sophisticated care work\n    And the community_elohim should value solidarity-building labor\n    And connecting different disability experiences strengthens whole community\n    And Alex's bridge-building accumulates care tokens\n    And the protocol should recognize that unity requires intentional work\n    And cross-community organizing should be appropriately valued\n    And Alex's solidarity work strengthens collective power for justice\n",
