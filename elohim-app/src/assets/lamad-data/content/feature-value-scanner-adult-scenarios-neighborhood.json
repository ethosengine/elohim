Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Adult\n  As an adult participating in neighborhood care economy\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want to engage in resource sharing and mutual aid\n  So that neighborhood resilience is built through visible care contributions\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the adult user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah lives in a defined neighborhood\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy\n    And multiple households participate in neighborhood care network\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces individual household costs\n    Given Sarah's household operates on limited budget\n    And neighbors have complementary resources and needs\n    When Sarah participates in neighborhood resource sharing\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate bulk buying\n    And it should facilitate tool lending among neighbors\n    And it should enable childcare exchanges\n    And it should reduce costs through collective purchasing\n    And neighborhood cooperation should improve household economics\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood mutual aid network provides crisis support\n    Given Sarah or her neighbors may face crises\n    And traditional systems often fail to provide timely support\n    When a household experiences emergency\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should activate mutual aid network\n    And neighbors with capacity should be prompted to help\n    And support should be immediate and community-based\n    And neighborhood should function as first-line safety net\n    And mutual aid should be coordinated effectively\n\n  Scenario: Sarah's care contributions give her standing in neighborhood decisions\n    Given Sarah participates actively in neighborhood care economy\n    And she contributes to collective well-being\n    When neighborhood governance decisions are made\n    Then Sarah's care contributions should be visible and valued\n    And her accumulated care work should give her voice\n    And neighborhood leadership should reflect actual contributions\n    And care economy participation should create legitimate standing\n    And neighborhood democracy should be based on demonstrated care\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood childcare coordination supports working parents\n    Given Sarah works full-time as a teacher\n    And childcare is expensive and inflexible\n    When neighborhood coordinates childcare sharing\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should match schedules and needs\n    And it should track reciprocal childcare exchanges\n    And it should help parents like Sarah support each other\n    And childcare costs should be reduced through cooperation\n    And quality care should be accessible to working families\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood food cooperative reduces costs and improves access\n    Given Sarah needs to feed family on budget\n    And food costs are significant household expense\n    When neighborhood organizes food cooperative\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate bulk purchasing\n    And it should manage cooperative logistics\n    And it should track members' contributions and access\n    And food should be more affordable through collective action\n    And Sarah's family should have better food security\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care economy builds social capital and relationships\n    Given Sarah is new to neighborhood\n    And social isolation is common in modern life\n    When Sarah participates in neighborhood care economy\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect her to other parents\n    And it should facilitate relationship-building through care exchanges\n    And it should help Sarah build local support network\n    And social capital should grow through care participation\n    And neighborhood should become genuine community, not just proximity\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care contributions visible across households\n    Given Sarah contributes to neighborhood care economy\n    And neighbors also contribute in various ways\n    When neighborhood care patterns are tracked\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should make contributions visible\n    And it should show who's contributing what\n    And it should identify imbalances in participation\n    And it should prompt recognition of neighbors' care work\n    And visibility should enable fair neighborhood participation\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood environmental initiatives coordinate care for place\n    Given neighborhood shares common environmental interests\n    And ecological care is part of care economy\n    When neighborhood organizes environmental initiatives\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate collective action\n    And it should track contributions to neighborhood environment\n    And it should organize community gardens, clean-ups, sustainability efforts\n    And care for place should be recognized as care work\n    And neighborhood should steward shared environment\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood conflict resolution supported by care economy data\n    Given neighbors sometimes have conflicts\n    And disputes can damage neighborhood cohesion\n    When neighborhood conflicts arise\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should provide context from care patterns\n    And it should show each party's contributions to neighborhood\n    And it should facilitate resolution based on mutual care\n    And conflicts should be addressed before they escalate\n    And care economy should support neighborhood harmony\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood privacy balanced with coordination needs\n    Given neighborhood care economy requires some data sharing\n    And Sarah values her household privacy\n    When Sarah participates in neighborhood coordination\n    Then she should control what information neighbors see\n    And household details should remain private unless shared\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should only share aggregated patterns\n    And Sarah's privacy should be protected while enabling coordination\n    And participation should not require sacrificing privacy\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care economy scales to municipal level\n    Given Sarah's neighborhood successfully implements care economy\n    And multiple neighborhoods could coordinate similarly\n    When neighborhood care patterns are established\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect to municipal systems\n    And it should enable scaling of successful practices\n    And neighborhood should serve as building block for municipal care economy\n    And local success should inform broader policy\n    And care economy should grow from neighborhood up, not top-down\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood resilience built through care economy practices\n    Given traditional economic systems leave neighborhoods vulnerable\n    And Sarah wants her neighborhood to be resilient\n    When neighborhood adopts care economy practices\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate resource sharing\n    And it should build mutual aid capacity\n    And it should create social capital through care exchanges\n    And neighborhood should become more resilient to crises\n    And care economy should strengthen community fabric\n",
