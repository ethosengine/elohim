Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Parent\n  As a parent balancing full-time professional work with intensive care labor\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want workplace policies that recognize my parenting responsibilities\n  So that I can perform both professional and care work sustainably\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the parent user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah works full-time as a teacher\n    And Sarah also manages 75% of household care labor\n    And Sarah is mother to Tommy (5) and Emma (8)\n    And the workplace governance context is active\n    And the workplace_elohim could coordinate organizational care economy\n    And Sarah is trying to balance professional and parenting work\n\n  Scenario: Workplace recognition that parenting is parallel full-time work\n    Given Sarah works 40 hours weekly as teacher\n    And she also performs 60+ hours weekly of parenting labor\n    When the workplace_elohim analyzes Sarah's total work\n    Then it should recognize she's working two full-time jobs\n    And it should make visible the dual burden she carries\n    And workplace should understand why flexibility is essential\n    And the system should demonstrate that working parents need support\n    And professional expectations should account for parenting responsibilities\n    And Sarah's full workload should be undeniably visible\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for family-friendly workplace policies\n    Given Sarah needs flexible scheduling to manage children's needs\n    And current workplace policies assume workers have no care responsibilities\n    When Sarah advocates for policy change\n    Then the workplace_elohim should provide supporting data\n    And it should show that working parents need flexibility\n    And it should help Sarah make evidence-based case for change\n    And advocacy labor should accumulate care tokens\n    And the system should amplify parent voices in workplace governance\n    And workplace should adopt policies that enable sustainable parenting\n\n  Scenario: Parenting skills recognized as professional capabilities\n    Given Sarah has professional-grade skills from parenting\n    And she manages complex logistics, conflict resolution, developmental psychology\n    When the workplace_elohim assesses Sarah's capabilities\n    Then it should recognize parenting skills as professional assets\n    And it should translate care skills to workplace context\n    And Sarah's parenting should enhance her professional value\n    And the system should make invisible skills visible to employers\n    And parenting experience should be recognized as professional development\n    And care work should be valued as capability-building\n\n  Scenario: Workplace boundaries protect time for parenting responsibilities\n    Given Sarah has legitimate parenting obligations\n    And work often encroaches on family time\n    When the workplace_elohim monitors work-life boundaries\n    Then it should flag when work is consuming family time\n    And it should help Sarah protect necessary parenting time\n    And it should validate that parenting obligations are real constraints\n    And the system should support boundary-setting with employer\n    And workplace demands should not be allowed to destroy family care\n    And Sarah should be empowered to say no to overwork\n\n  Scenario: Professional schedule coordination with children's needs\n    Given Tommy and Emma have school schedules, activities, appointments\n    And Sarah's work schedule must coordinate with family needs\n    When the workplace_elohim helps coordinate scheduling\n    Then it should integrate work and family calendars\n    And it should surface conflicts between professional and parenting obligations\n    And it should help Sarah negotiate necessary flexibility\n    And the system should recognize scheduling as complex coordination work\n    And workplace should accommodate parent scheduling needs\n    And Sarah should have tools to manage impossible complexity\n\n  Scenario: Workplace privacy from family care data\n    Given Sarah's parenting data should not be accessible to employer\n    And strict privacy boundaries are essential\n    When workplace and personal systems interact\n    Then the workplace must have zero access to family care data\n    And Sarah's personal_agent should protect her privacy absolutely\n    And the workplace_elohim should respect complete privacy boundaries\n    And the system should prevent workplace surveillance of personal life\n    And professional and family spheres should remain separate\n    And Sarah's care data should be her sovereign information\n\n  Scenario: Fair compensation accounting for care work burden\n    Given Sarah performs enormous unpaid care labor\n    And this work subsidizes employer by enabling her professional work\n    When Sarah negotiates compensation\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help her articulate fair pay\n    And it should recognize that low wages force families into poverty\n    And it should support advocacy for family-sustaining compensation\n    And the system should help Sarah argue that fair pay enables family care\n    And workplace should pay wages that support household flourishing\n    And compensation should reflect total value of human labor\n\n  Scenario: Parental leave recognized as essential workplace benefit\n    Given parents need time for infant care, adoption, family crisis\n    And parental leave is essential for child well-being\n    When the workplace_elohim assesses workplace policies\n    Then it should flag inadequate parental leave as care economy violation\n    And it should help Sarah advocate for better leave policies\n    And the system should recognize parental leave as basic necessity\n    And workplace should provide substantial paid parental leave\n    And care economy principles should require workplace support for new parents\n    And Sarah should have support for advocating for family leave\n\n  Scenario: Managing professional identity alongside parent identity\n    Given Sarah is both teacher and mother\n    And these identities sometimes conflict or compete\n    When Sarah navigates professional and parenting identities\n    Then the personal_agent should help her integrate both roles\n    And it should recognize she is complete person with multiple identities\n    And it should support her wholeness across contexts\n    And the system should help her maintain both professional and parent identity\n    And neither role should consume total identity\n    And Sarah should be supported in being both teacher and mother\n\n  Scenario: Workplace emotional labor while managing parenting stress\n    Given Sarah performs emotional labor with students and colleagues\n    And she's also managing intense parenting emotional demands\n    When the workplace_elohim tracks total emotional labor\n    Then it should recognize dual emotional work burden\n    And it should flag when emotional demands are unsustainable\n    And it should recognize that parents carry compounded emotional labor\n    And the system should help Sarah manage total emotional load\n    And workplace should understand parents' emotional labor reality\n    And Sarah's complete emotional work should be visible and valued\n\n  Scenario: Sick children and workplace accommodation\n    Given children get sick frequently\n    And Sarah needs to care for sick children\n    When Tommy or Emma is sick\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help Sarah navigate work accommodations\n    And it should recognize parent's obligation to care for sick child\n    And it should support requesting necessary time off\n    And the system should validate that child care is priority\n    And workplace should accommodate parent responsibilities\n    And Sarah should not face professional penalty for parenting obligations\n\n  Scenario: Professional development coordinated with parenting constraints\n    Given Sarah wants to pursue professional growth\n    And she has limited time due to parenting responsibilities\n    When Sarah considers professional development opportunities\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help her assess feasibility\n    And it should integrate family constraints into planning\n    And it should help her find development opportunities compatible with parenting\n    And professional growth should be possible despite parenting demands\n    And the system should support career development for working parents\n    And Sarah should not have to choose between career and family\n",
