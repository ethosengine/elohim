  "content": "Scenario: Parent connects municipal budget to school funding\n    Given the municipality is finalizing annual budget priorities\n    And the parent doesn't understand how city budget affects schools\n    When the parent reviews Observer's municipal-education analysis\n    Then they see how city tax decisions impact school district funding\n    And understand library budget cuts reduce children's book access\n    And learn recreation spending affects afterschool program availability\n    And municipal decisions connect to children's educational resources\n    And parent advocacy expands to city-level budget priorities\n",
