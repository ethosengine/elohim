Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Teen\n  As a teen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want my paid work recognized as care labor with fair compensation and healthy conditions\n  So that I learn to recognize my rights as a worker and expect all work to operate on care economy principles\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teen user \"Jasmine\" is registered in the system\n    And Jasmine is 16 years old\n    And she works part-time (15 hours/week) at a retail store\n    And the workplace governance context is active\n    And workplace_elohim monitors work conditions and labor recognition\n    And Jasmine's personal_agent serves as workplace advocate\n\n  Scenario: Teen's paid work recognized as care labor\n    Given Jasmine works in retail serving customers\n    And traditional economics treats this as market transaction only\n    When workplace_elohim processes her work\n    Then it should recognize that her labor is care work\n    And helping customers find what they need is care\n    And supporting co-workers is care\n    And contributing to community through her work is care\n    And she should learn to see all work through care economy lens\n    And understand that service work is valuable care labor\n    And expect her work to be valued as contribution to collective flourishing\n\n  Scenario: Workplace conditions monitored to prevent teen labor exploitation\n    Given Jasmine is vulnerable as a young worker\n    And young workers often face exploitation\n    When workplace_elohim tracks her work conditions\n    Then it should monitor whether she's fairly compensated for her labor\n    And flag if hours exceed healthy limits\n    And recognize if she's asked to work in unsafe conditions\n    And track if she's getting required breaks\n    And identify if she's experiencing harassment or discrimination\n    And surface resources about her rights as a worker\n    And provide support if workplace becomes exploitative\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns to recognize fair compensation\n    Given Jasmine earns $15/hour at her retail job\n    And the local living wage is $18/hour\n    When her personal_agent analyzes her compensation\n    Then it should help her understand whether pay is fair\n    And show how her wages compare to living wage standards\n    And help her calculate the real value of her labor\n    And teach her to recognize when work is undercompensated\n    And build her expectation that labor deserves fair compensation\n    And prepare her to advocate for fair wages as an adult worker\n\n  Scenario: Teen's work schedule coordinated with other life contexts\n    Given Jasmine balances work, school, family responsibilities, and social life\n    And her work schedule changes weekly\n    When workplace_elohim communicates her schedule\n    Then it should coordinate with her personal_agent\n    And flag conflicts with school, family needs, or personal commitments\n    And help her negotiate schedule that allows balanced life\n    And prevent work from overwhelming other essential contexts\n    And support her learning to set healthy work boundaries\n    And demonstrate that work is one part of life, not life itself\n\n  Scenario: Workplace skills integrated with broader capability development\n    Given Jasmine learns customer service, inventory management, and problem-solving at work\n    And these skills transfer to other contexts\n    When her personal_agent tracks skill development\n    Then it should recognize skills gained through work\n    And surface how workplace skills apply to other life contexts\n    And connect to educational and career planning\n    And help her see work as capability building, not just income\n    And integrate workplace learning with her overall development\n    And value skills development as part of work's worth\n\n  Scenario: Teen understands worker rights and labor protections\n    Given Jasmine is entitled to labor protections as a worker\n    And many young workers don't know their rights\n    When workplace_elohim provides education about worker rights\n    Then it should teach her about minimum wage, overtime, breaks, and safety regulations\n    And explain youth-specific labor protections\n    And inform her about right to organize and collective bargaining\n    And provide resources about reporting labor violations\n    And help her understand that worker rights exist to prevent exploitation\n    And build her expectation that labor deserves legal protection\n\n  Scenario: Workplace relationships build professional networks\n    Given Jasmine works with manager Sarah and co-workers across age ranges\n    And workplace relationships can support her future career\n    When workplace_elohim tracks her professional relationship development\n    Then it should recognize relationship building as valuable outcome of work\n    And help her understand how to develop professional references\n    And surface when relationships could support her career goals\n    And teach her to navigate workplace relationships appropriately\n    And build her professional social capital\n    And demonstrate that work creates networks, not just income\n\n  Scenario: Teen's labor contribution valued at appropriate care economy rates\n    Given Jasmine works 15 hours per week\n    And her labor has real economic value\n    When workplace_elohim calculates her care contributions\n    Then it should value her work at care economy rates, not just market wages\n    And recognize that her labor enables the business to function\n    And track the full value she creates, not just what she's paid\n    And help her understand the difference between value created and compensation received\n    And build her critical awareness of labor economics\n    And prepare her to advocate for fair value recognition\n\n  Scenario: Workplace serves teen's development, not just employer's profit\n    Given Jasmine's work should contribute to her flourishing\n    And employment should support her transition to adulthood\n    When workplace_elohim evaluates the work relationship\n    Then it should assess whether work supports her development\n    And flag if work interferes with education or wellbeing\n    And recognize if employer is investing in her skill development\n    And identify if work experience is building her career capability\n    And advocate that employment should serve mutual benefit\n    And help her understand that healthy employment supports worker flourishing\n\n  Scenario: Teen co-workers coordinate through care economy networks\n    Given Jasmine works with other teens and young adults\n    And worker solidarity improves conditions for all\n    When teen workers coordinate through care economy\n    Then workplace_elohim should facilitate peer worker networks\n    And support information sharing about workplace conditions\n    And enable collective advocacy for better treatment\n    And help young workers recognize common interests\n    And build understanding that workers have power through solidarity\n    And demonstrate care economy principles in workplace organizing\n\n  Scenario: Part-time work integrated with care economy understanding\n    Given Jasmine's income from work is part of her broader economic participation\n    And she also contributes unpaid household labor and community volunteering\n    When her personal_agent aggregates her economic activity\n    Then it should integrate paid work with other care contributions\n    And show that her economic life includes market and non-market work\n    And help her understand comprehensive view of her economic participation\n    And recognize that unpaid care work is as valuable as paid work\n    And build sophisticated understanding that economy is broader than paid employment\n    And internalize care economy framework as normal economic thinking\n\n  Scenario: Workplace exploitation flagged and resources provided\n    Given Jasmine's employer violates labor laws\n    And she is asked to work off the clock\n    When workplace_elohim detects the violation\n    Then it should flag the exploitation to Jasmine\n    And explain that this is illegal and not acceptable\n    And provide resources about reporting labor violations\n    And connect her to worker advocacy organizations\n    And support her in addressing the problem\n    And protect her from accepting exploitation as normal\n    And demonstrate that care economy includes protecting workers from harm\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns healthy work-life boundaries\n    Given Jasmine's employer frequently requests last-minute schedule changes\n    And this disrupts her school and family commitments\n    When workplace_elohim tracks scheduling patterns\n    Then it should recognize the boundary violation\n    And help her understand that she has right to reasonable scheduling\n    And support her in negotiating better scheduling practices\n    And teach her that workers can and should set boundaries\n    And build her expectation that work should respect whole life\n    And prepare her for adult advocacy for work-life balance\n",
