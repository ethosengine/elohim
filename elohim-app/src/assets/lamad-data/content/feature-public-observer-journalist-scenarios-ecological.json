Environmental Accountability Journalism for Journalist\n  As a journalist in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the ecological governance layer\n  I want comprehensive environmental surveillance across jurisdictions\n  So that environmental journalism exposes pollution and holds power accountable\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the journalist user is registered in the system\n    And the ecological governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Journalist monitors environmental permits across multiple agencies\n    Given the journalist covers regional environmental issues\n    And must track city, county, state, and federal environmental agencies\n    When the Observer monitors all environmental agencies simultaneously\n    Then the journalist reviews all permit applications and approvals\n    And receives alerts for controversial permits and violations\n    And tracks cumulative environmental impacts across jurisdictions\n    And comprehensive environmental surveillance becomes sustainable\n    And polluters cannot hide in bureaucratic complexity\n\n  Scenario: Journalist exposes environmental racism through pattern recognition\n    Given pollution facilities cluster in certain communities\n    And the journalist investigates environmental justice\n    When the Observer analyzes environmental permit patterns\n    Then the journalist sees industrial permits concentrate in communities of color\n    And maps proximity of pollution sources to schools and residences\n    And documents health outcome disparities by neighborhood demographics\n    And shows pattern persists across decades of permitting decisions\n    And publishes investigation exposing systematic environmental racism\n\n  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks industry claims on pollution reduction\n    Given a corporation claims environmental leadership\n    And the journalist investigates actual environmental record\n    When the Observer analyzes company's violations and emissions\n    Then the journalist finds 23 violations in past 5 years\n    And verifies emissions increased despite efficiency claims\n    And shows company lobbied against stronger pollution regulations\n    And identifies millions in fines that were never paid\n    And publishes investigation exposing greenwashing\n\n  Scenario: Journalist investigates regulatory capture of environmental agency\n    Given environmental regulations are weakly enforced\n    And the journalist suspects industry influence over regulators\n    When the Observer tracks regulatory agency decisions and relationships\n    Then the journalist sees violation fines reduced 78% in 3 years\n    And documents revolving door between industry and agency leadership\n    And identifies campaign contributions from regulated industries\n    And shows pattern of violations detected but not penalized\n    And publishes investigation exposing regulatory capture\n\n  Scenario: Journalist tracks climate commitments to accountability\n    Given city and state announced climate action plans\n    And the journalist covered initial announcements\n    When the Observer monitors climate policy implementation\n    Then the journalist finds emissions reduction targets are not being met\n    And sees policies that would reduce emissions remain unimplemented\n    And identifies budget cuts to climate programs despite commitments\n    And documents gap between climate rhetoric and action\n    And publishes accountability story on broken climate promises\n\n  Scenario: Journalist detects pollution pattern across watershed\n    Given the journalist investigates water quality concerns\n    And pollution affects communities across watershed\n    When the Observer tracks environmental data across jurisdictions\n    Then the journalist sees contamination pattern from industrial facility upstream\n    And maps affected communities downstream across state lines\n    And documents regulatory agencies failing to coordinate enforcement\n    And shows company violated permits in multiple states\n    And publishes regional investigation forcing coordinated response\n\n  Scenario: Journalist develops whistleblower source on environmental violations\n    Given an employee witnesses company illegally dumping waste\n    And fears job loss for reporting violations\n    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel\n    Then the whistleblower shares evidence of illegal dumping\n    And journalist investigates without exposing source\n    And verifies claims through regulatory records and site investigation\n    And publishes investigation leading to enforcement action\n    And source protection enables environmental accountability\n\n  Scenario: Journalist investigates developer environmental impact claims\n    Given a major development project claims environmental sustainability\n    And the journalist evaluates environmental impact claims\n    When the Observer analyzes developer's environmental track record\n    Then the journalist finds developer's past projects harmed ecosystems\n    And verifies sustainability claims contradict actual development plans\n    And identifies wetland destruction despite mitigation promises\n    And shows developer has outstanding violations in other states\n    And publishes investigation challenging project approval\n    And instant research exposes developer deception\n",
