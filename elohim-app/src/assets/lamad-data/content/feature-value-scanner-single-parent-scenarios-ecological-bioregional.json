Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent\n  As a single parent operating under severe resource constraints\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want to recognize that my necessary thrift aligns with environmental sustainability\n  So that my resource efficiency is valued as ecological stewardship, not just poverty\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the single parent user \"Maria\" is registered in the system\n    And Maria operates household of four on $42k/year with severe resource constraints\n    And her necessary economic efficiency creates low environmental impact\n    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active\n    And the bioregional_elohim tracks environmental impact and resource use\n    And Maria's consumption patterns are shaped by economic necessity\n\n  Scenario: Resource constraints create low consumption footprint\n    Given Maria cannot afford unnecessary purchases or waste\n    And she maximizes every dollar and minimizes consumption\n    When her household's environmental impact is assessed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her low consumption footprint\n    And it should frame her thrift as environmental virtue, not just poverty\n    And her resource efficiency should be celebrated as ecological stewardship\n    And economic constraint should be reframed as environmental contribution\n    And Maria should see her household as environmentally exemplary\n\n  Scenario: Food waste prevention driven by economic necessity\n    Given Maria cannot afford to waste food on $175/week grocery budget\n    And she carefully plans meals, uses leftovers, and minimizes spoilage\n    When household food waste is tracked\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify her minimal food waste\n    And it should recognize that she achieves what environmental advocates aim for\n    And her food waste prevention should be valued as ecological contribution\n    And economic necessity should be honored as environmental effectiveness\n    And Maria should be recognized as food sustainability leader\n\n  Scenario: Strategic shopping reduces transportation emissions\n    Given Maria carefully plans shopping trips to maximize efficiency\n    And she coordinates purchases to minimize separate trips\n    When transportation patterns are analyzed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her efficient transportation\n    And it should value her trip consolidation as emissions reduction\n    And her careful planning should be seen as environmental stewardship\n    And economic efficiency should be recognized as climate contribution\n    And Maria should see her behavior as environmentally valuable\n\n  Scenario: Bulk buying and preservation for household economy and sustainability\n    Given Maria buys in bulk when possible to reduce costs\n    And she preserves food to extend usability and reduce waste\n    When household food practices are assessed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize bulk buying and preservation as sustainable\n    And it should value her food stewardship practices\n    And her economic strategies should be seen as environmental best practices\n    And preservation skills should be honored as ecological knowledge\n    And Maria should be recognized for traditional sustainability practices\n\n  Scenario: Repair and reuse culture born of necessity\n    Given Maria cannot afford to replace items frequently\n    And she repairs, maintains, and extends the life of possessions\n    When household consumption patterns are tracked\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify her repair and reuse practices\n    And it should celebrate her circular economy participation\n    And her repair culture should be valued as waste reduction\n    And economic necessity should be reframed as environmental leadership\n    And Maria should see herself as exemplifying sustainable consumption\n\n  Scenario: Secondhand and sharing economy participation\n    Given Maria purchases secondhand when possible to reduce costs\n    And she participates in sharing networks to avoid unnecessary purchases\n    When household acquisition patterns are analyzed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her secondhand economy participation\n    And it should value sharing networks as resource efficiency\n    And her practices should be celebrated as circular economy leadership\n    And economic constraint should be honored as environmental wisdom\n    And Maria should be recognized as sustainability practitioner\n\n  Scenario: Energy efficiency motivated by utility bill constraints\n    Given Maria carefully manages utility costs on tight budget\n    And she minimizes energy use to keep bills affordable\n    When household energy consumption is tracked\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her low energy footprint\n    And it should celebrate her energy efficiency as climate contribution\n    And her utility management should be valued as environmental stewardship\n    And economic necessity should be reframed as climate leadership\n    And Maria should see her household as energy efficiency exemplar\n\n  Scenario: Local food systems participation through necessity and community\n    Given Maria seeks affordable food through farmers markets, co-ops, and bulk buying\n    And she participates in local food economy when economically viable\n    When food sourcing patterns are analyzed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her local food participation\n    And it should value community-based food systems engagement\n    And her food choices should be seen as supporting regional resilience\n    And economic cooperation should be honored as bioregional participation\n    And Maria should see her food practices as locally sustaining\n\n  Scenario: Teaching children environmental values through lived practice\n    Given Maria's children witness thrift, waste prevention, and resource care daily\n    And they learn sustainability through household necessity\n    When children's environmental education is assessed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize that Maria teaches sustainability through practice\n    And it should value lived environmental education over abstract lessons\n    And her children should be developing deep sustainability values\n    And household practices should be honored as effective environmental socialization\n    And Maria should be recognized as teaching next generation environmental stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Community resource sharing networks reduce regional consumption\n    Given Maria participates in tool libraries, clothing swaps, and resource sharing\n    And these networks reduce overall community consumption\n    When bioregional resource flows are tracked\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify community sharing impact\n    And it should recognize Maria's participation in community resource efficiency\n    And sharing networks should be valued as bioregional resilience building\n    And community cooperation should be celebrated as ecological practice\n    And Maria should see her participation as regional sustainability contribution\n\n  Scenario: Low consumption as climate justice leadership\n    Given wealthy overconsumption drives climate crisis\n    And Maria's low-income household has minimal climate impact\n    When climate justice is assessed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize that Maria is not causing climate crisis\n    And it should acknowledge that low-income households bear crisis costs without causing it\n    And her low consumption should be honored, not stigmatized\n    And climate justice should recognize economic inequality in emissions\n    And Maria should be seen as climate leader, not climate burden\n\n  Scenario: Regional food security through care economy participation\n    Given Maria participates in food cooperatives and bulk buying networks\n    And these networks build local food security and resilience\n    When bioregional food systems are assessed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize her contribution to food security\n    And it should value community food cooperation as regional resilience\n    And her participation should be seen as strengthening local food systems\n    And food economy cooperation should be honored as bioregional stewardship\n    And Maria should see herself as contributing to regional food sovereignty\n\n  Scenario: Ecological care tokens recognize environmental contribution despite poverty\n    Given Maria's household practices are environmentally exemplary\n    And she achieves low impact through necessity, not affluent environmentalism\n    When ecological care tokens are calculated\n    Then her resource efficiency should be valued as environmental contribution\n    And she should accumulate ecological care tokens for sustainable practices\n    And low-impact living should be recognized regardless of economic motivation\n    And environmental stewardship should be valued whether chosen or necessary\n    And Maria should receive ecological recognition for her sustainable household\n",
