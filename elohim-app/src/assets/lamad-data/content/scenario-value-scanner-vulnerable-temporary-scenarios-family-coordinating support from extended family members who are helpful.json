  "content": "Scenario: Coordinating support from extended family members who are helpful\n    Given some extended family members (my parents, siblings) want to help\n    And their support is genuine and appropriate\n    When I coordinate family assistance with children or resources\n    Then the family_elohim helps me organize extended family support\n    And tracks who's helping with what to distribute requests fairly\n    And maintains my authority as primary decision-maker\n    And ensures family help respects my boundaries and parenting choices\n    And facilitates communication about children's needs\n    And my personal_agent helps me ask for help when needed\n    And recognizes that coordinating family support is labor\n    And validates that accepting help is strength, not failure\n",
