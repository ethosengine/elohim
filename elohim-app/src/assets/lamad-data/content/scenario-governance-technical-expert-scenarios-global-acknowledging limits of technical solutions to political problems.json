  "content": "Scenario: Acknowledging limits of technical solutions to political problems\n    Given some delegates hope technology will solve governance challenges\n    And I must clarify what technology can and cannot do\n    When I testify about technical limits\n    Then I explain: technology enables but doesn't replace democratic choice\n    And I clarify: that AI cannot resolve fundamental values conflicts\n    And I acknowledge: many governance problems are political not technical\n    And I resist: techno-solutionism and engineering hubris\n    And I honor: that democracy is about human judgment not optimization\n    And I demonstrate: epistemic humility about technology's role\n    And I serve: realistic understanding of technical possibilities\n",
