Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult\n  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want to participate in neighborhood care economy and mutual support\n  So that I build local resilience, share resources, and strengthen community ties\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the middle-aged user \"Robert\" is registered in the system\n    And Robert is 52 years old living in established suburban neighborhood\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy\n    And the neighborhood has mix of young families, middle-aged adults, and elderly residents\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care exchange coordinates mutual support\n    Given Robert has skills and resources to share\n    And he also needs support managing his care demands\n    And neighbors have complementary needs and capacities\n    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates care exchange\n    Then it should match Robert's capacities with neighborhood needs\n    And connect him to neighbors who can provide support\n    And recognize his contributions: lawn care help for elderly neighbor, professional mentoring\n    And surface opportunities: \"Maria can provide backup childcare when your grandchild visits\"\n    And build reciprocal relationships based on mutual care\n    And demonstrate that neighborhood functions through care exchange\n    And strengthen local social capital\n\n  Scenario: Elder care support shared across neighborhood\n    Given Robert's parents visit regularly and will eventually need local care\n    And several neighbors are also managing elder care\n    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates elder care support\n    Then it should connect neighbors managing similar challenges\n    And facilitate sharing of resources, knowledge, and respite\n    And surface: \"Three neighbors use the same home health agency\u2014could coordinate for better rates\"\n    And build neighborhood capacity to support aging residents\n    And prevent isolation for those managing elder care\n    And create mutual support network for common challenges\n    And strengthen neighborhood through shared caregiving\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces costs and builds connection\n    Given Robert has tools, equipment, and skills\n    And buying everything individually is expensive and wasteful\n    And neighbors have resources that Robert occasionally needs\n    When neighborhood_elohim facilitates resource sharing\n    Then it should coordinate tool libraries, equipment sharing, and skill exchange\n    And track contributions: \"Robert has lent tools 12 times, borrowed 8 times\"\n    And reduce household expenses through sharing\n    And build relationships through resource exchange\n    And demonstrate care economy principles at neighborhood scale\n    And reduce consumption through sharing economy\n    And strengthen neighborhood bonds through mutual support\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood emergency preparedness builds resilience\n    Given emergencies and crises happen\n    And neighborhoods with strong connections respond better to crisis\n    And Robert has professional skills useful in emergencies\n    When neighborhood_elohim supports emergency preparedness\n    Then it should coordinate neighborhood emergency planning\n    And map neighborhood skills and resources\n    And recognize Robert's management and coordination capabilities\n    And connect neighbors who can support each other in crisis\n    And build neighborhood resilience through known relationships\n    And ensure isolated residents are included in emergency networks\n    And demonstrate that care economy creates crisis resilience\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood collective action on shared concerns\n    Given neighborhood faces shared challenges\n    And individual action is less effective than collective action\n    And Robert has leadership capacity from professional experience\n    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates collective action\n    Then it should facilitate neighborhood organizing around shared concerns\n    And recognize Robert's leadership capabilities\n    And help coordinate neighborhood improvement projects\n    And surface opportunities for collective action\n    And build neighborhood governance capacity\n    And demonstrate that care for place is part of care economy\n    And strengthen neighborhood through collaborative problem-solving\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care economy includes middle-aged leadership\n    Given Robert has decades of life experience\n    And he has accumulated professional and personal capabilities\n    And he's positioned to contribute neighborhood leadership\n    When neighborhood_elohim recognizes his leadership potential\n    Then it should surface leadership opportunities appropriate to his capacity\n    And connect him to neighborhood governance roles\n    And recognize his care contributions as qualifying him for leadership\n    And help him balance leadership with his existing demands\n    And prevent overcommitment that would overwhelm him\n    And channel his capabilities toward neighborhood improvement\n    And build neighborhood leadership from accumulated care experience\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood time bank values all contributions equitably\n    Given Robert contributes professional skills and labor\n    And neighbors contribute different skills and capacities\n    And all contributions have value in care economy\n    When neighborhood_elohim manages time bank\n    Then it should value Robert's professional mentoring and manual labor equally\n    And recognize all neighborhood contributions as care work\n    And prevent hierarchy where professional skills are valued more than care labor\n    And build neighborhood equity through time bank reciprocity\n    And demonstrate care economy principles in practice\n    And strengthen neighborhood through mutual recognition\n    And create alternative economy based on care rather than market\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood supports work-life balance for middle-aged adults\n    Given Robert manages intense work and care demands\n    And neighborhood support could ease his burden\n    And he can also provide flexibility support to neighbors\n    When neighborhood_elohim coordinates flexible support\n    Then it should connect neighbors who can provide backup care\n    And help Robert find local support for care emergencies\n    And recognize his contributions when he helps neighbors\n    And build mutual support networks for managing work-life balance\n    And reduce isolation of managing demands alone\n    And demonstrate that neighborhoods can support balanced lives\n    And strengthen community through practical mutual aid\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood children and elders connected across generations\n    Given Robert's grandchild occasionally visits\n    And neighborhood has elderly residents and young families\n    And intergenerational connection benefits everyone\n    When neighborhood_elohim facilitates intergenerational connection\n    Then it should coordinate intergenerational activities\n    And connect Robert's visiting grandchild with neighborhood children\n    And facilitate connections between neighborhood elders and families\n    And build multigenerational neighborhood care networks\n    And reduce isolation for elderly residents\n    And provide care and enrichment for children\n    And demonstrate that neighborhoods thrive through age diversity\n    And strengthen community through intergenerational care\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care tokens recognize local contributions\n    Given Robert contributes to neighborhood care economy\n    And his contributions strengthen neighborhood for everyone\n    When neighborhood_elohim tracks care tokens\n    Then it should recognize his neighborhood care contributions\n    And value his help for elderly neighbors, resource sharing, and leadership\n    And accumulate tokens that reflect his neighborhood care work\n    And connect tokens to neighborhood governance voice\n    And demonstrate that care contributions create social capital\n    And recognize that neighborhood care is genuine economic contribution\n    And build neighborhood through reciprocal care recognition\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood inclusion ensures isolated residents are connected\n    Given some neighbors are isolated due to age, disability, or circumstance\n    And Robert has capacity to reach out\n    And neighborhood care economy should include everyone\n    When neighborhood_elohim identifies isolated residents\n    Then it should surface opportunities to connect with isolated neighbors\n    And help Robert offer appropriate support\n    And recognize his outreach as valuable care contribution\n    And build inclusive neighborhood where no one is invisible\n    And prevent isolation that harms individual and neighborhood wellbeing\n    And demonstrate that care economy includes intentional inclusion\n    And strengthen neighborhood by ensuring everyone belongs\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood boundaries prevent over-commitment\n    Given Robert has limited capacity amid other demands\n    And neighborhood participation could expand indefinitely\n    And sustainable participation requires boundaries\n    When neighborhood_elohim monitors Robert's neighborhood engagement\n    Then it should recognize when neighborhood demands exceed his capacity\n    And help him set healthy boundaries on neighborhood participation\n    And surface when he's taking on too much neighborhood responsibility\n    And support him in saying no to additional commitments\n    And ensure neighborhood participation enhances rather than depletes him\n    And protect him from burnout through over-commitment\n    And help him maintain sustainable neighborhood engagement\n",
