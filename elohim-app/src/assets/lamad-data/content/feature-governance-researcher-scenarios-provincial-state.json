Provincial/State-Level Governance Research for Researcher\n  As a researcher in the governance system\n  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer\n  I want to conduct comparative quantitative studies across many communities\n  So that I can identify patterns, test hypotheses, and provide generalizable findings\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the researcher user is registered in the system\n    And the provincial_state governance context is active\n    And Dr. James Chen is conducting large-scale comparative research\n\n  Scenario: Comparing protocol adoption outcomes across hundreds of communities\n    Given I am studying all communities in the state that adopted Elohim Protocol\n    And I have comparison group of similar communities without adoption\n    When I analyze outcomes data from 200+ communities over 5 years\n    Then I examine: which communities adopted and which didn't (selection patterns)\n    And I measure: wellbeing, trust, economic resilience, social cohesion differences\n    And I use: difference-in-differences analysis to estimate causal effects\n    And I control: for demographics, economics, political culture confounds\n    And I identify: what predicts adoption success vs struggle\n    And I provide: statistical evidence about protocol effectiveness at scale\n    And I distinguish: average effects from heterogeneous effects across community types\n\n  Scenario: Analyzing Regional Constitutional Council decision patterns\n    Given Sarah Martinez's Regional Council has reviewed 500+ appeals\n    And I have anonymized data on appeals, deliberations, and outcomes\n    When I analyze patterns in regional constitutional interpretation\n    Then I examine: which types of appeals succeed vs fail\n    And I track: consistency across different council compositions\n    And I identify: whether councils reach similar conclusions for similar cases\n    And I explore: how precedent influences subsequent decisions\n    And I assess: whether councils defer too much to technical experts\n    And I investigate: demographic patterns in council member influence\n    And My analysis reveals: whether sortition governance produces coherent law\n\n  Scenario: Natural experiment comparing communities with vs without protocol\n    Given some adjacent communities adopted protocol while neighbors didn't\n    And these communities are similar in demographics and economics\n    When I study outcomes comparing adopters to non-adopters\n    Then I isolate: protocol effects from confounding factors\n    And I measure: differences in wellbeing, crisis response, social cohesion\n    And I examine: spillover effects across community boundaries\n    And I analyze: why some communities adopted and others resisted\n    And I provide: quasi-experimental evidence about causality\n    And My findings distinguish: correlation from causation in protocol effects\n    And Evidence serves policymakers deciding whether to support adoption\n\n  Scenario: Studying marginalized community access and outcomes\n    Given I hypothesize protocol might help or harm marginalized communities\n    And I need to rigorously test distributional effects\n    When I analyze outcomes by race, class, disability, immigration status\n    Then I examine: whether marginalized communities adopt at equal rates\n    And I assess: whether they face barriers to effective participation\n    And I measure: whether Constitutional Council service includes them proportionally\n    And I analyze: whether appeal outcomes differ by demographic group\n    And I investigate: whether protocol reduces or exacerbates inequality\n    And I provide: evidence about who benefits and who suffers from protocol\n    And My research serves: justice by making invisible inequities visible\n\n  Scenario: Longitudinal study of Constitutional Council member development\n    Given I am tracking council members like Sarah over time\n    And I want to understand how service affects them\n    When I study council members before, during, and after service\n    Then I measure: constitutional literacy development\n    And I assess: deliberative skill acquisition\n    And I examine: civic confidence and participation changes\n    And I track: whether capabilities persist after service ends\n    And I explore: whether service affects children's civic development\n    And I analyze: whether sortition creates democratic capacity at population scale\n    And My research tests: whether citizen governance transforms citizens\n\n  Scenario: Analyzing technical expert influence on council decisions\n    Given councils rely on experts like Dr. Okonkwo for technical understanding\n    And I question whether experts dominate rather than inform\n    When I analyze correlation between expert testimony and council decisions\n    Then I examine: how often councils follow expert recommendations\n    And I identify: cases where councils override expert advice\n    And I assess: whether expert testimony quality predicts council confidence\n    And I explore: whether some experts influence more than others\n    And I investigate: warning signs of expert capture vs healthy advice\n    And My research reveals: whether technical-democratic balance is working\n    And Findings inform: expert testimony guidelines and council training\n\n  Scenario: Comparative methodology testing different governance models\n    Given I want to compare sortition councils to alternative governance approaches\n    And some regions use elected representatives, others expert panels, others algorithms\n    When I conduct systematic comparison across governance models\n    Then I examine: decision quality (outcomes, constitutional alignment, legitimacy)\n    And I assess: participation (who governs, how accessible, how diverse)\n    And I measure: trust (public confidence in decisions)\n    And I analyze: adaptability (responding to new challenges)\n    And I compare: costs (resources required vs benefits delivered)\n    And I provide: evidence about relative strengths of different models\n    And My research serves: democratic choice among governance alternatives\n\n  Scenario: Preregistration of hypotheses to prevent cherry-picking results\n    Given I want my research to be scientifically credible\n    And I know publication bias favors positive findings\n    When I design my regional study\n    Then I preregister: hypotheses before seeing the data\n    And I commit: to reporting all results not just flattering ones\n    And I plan: analysis methods in advance to prevent p-hacking\n    And I document: any deviations from preregistered plan with justification\n    And I publish: null results and failures alongside successes\n    And My methodological rigor maintains: scientific integrity over advocacy\n    And Credibility comes from: honesty about what works and what doesn't\n\n  Scenario: Providing evidence to Senator Ruiz for policy development\n    Given Senator Ruiz is drafting AI governance legislation\n    And she needs evidence about what regulatory approaches help vs harm\n    When I brief her committee on my regional research findings\n    Then I present: rigorous evaluation of protocol outcomes\n    And I explain: what factors predict successful adoption\n    And I provide: evidence about marginalized community access\n    And I offer: comparative findings about governance models\n    And I testify: honestly about limitations and uncertainties\n    And I maintain: independence by reporting truth not advocacy\n    And My research becomes: evidence base for democratic policy making\n\n  Scenario: Identifying emerging issues through annual evaluation cycles\n    Given I analyze regional data annually to track trends\n    And I want to identify problems before they become crises\n    When I examine this year's patterns compared to previous years\n    Then I notice: appeal rates trending up (good\u2014people know recourse exists)\n    And I identify: recurring adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging\n    And I detect: systematic issue with business loan evaluation criteria\n    And I recognize: elderly accessibility remaining challenging\n    And I flag: potential issues for community leaders and policymakers\n    And My timely analysis enables: proactive response to emerging challenges\n    And Research provides: early warning system for governance problems\n\n  Scenario: Regional research consortium collaboration\n    Given I am part of network studying protocol across multiple regions\n    And we coordinate methods to enable comparison\n    When we conduct parallel studies with shared protocols\n    Then we can: pool data to increase statistical power\n    And we enable: replication across different contexts\n    And we identify: universal patterns vs context-specific findings\n    And we learn: from each other's methodological innovations\n    And we create: cumulative knowledge building across research community\n    And My regional work contributes to: global understanding of democratic AI governance\n",
