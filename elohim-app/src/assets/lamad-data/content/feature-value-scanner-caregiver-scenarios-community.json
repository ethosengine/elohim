Community Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver\n  As a caregiver engaging with community care economy\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want community systems that recognize family caregiving as essential care work\n  So that community care economy sustains family caregivers and values their contributions\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the caregiver user \"James\" is registered in the system\n    And James provides intensive care for David (early-onset Alzheimer's)\n    And James coordinates care for his mother (76)\n    And James's care work is worth estimated $50k+/year professionally\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates care economy at scale\n    And family caregivers provide $470 billion/year in invisible care nationally\n\n  Scenario: Community recognition of family caregiving as professional-grade work\n    Given James provides skilled care equivalent to professional nursing\n    And his work is invisible because he cares for family\n    When the community_elohim evaluates caregiving contributions\n    Then James's care should be valued at professional rates\n    And community should recognize family caregiving as essential infrastructure\n    And care token accumulation should reflect professional-grade value\n    And invisibility of family care should be systematically addressed\n    And community care economy should make family caregiving visible\n\n  Scenario: Community care economy supplements for reduced household income\n    Given James's household income dropped from $80k to $40k due to caregiving\n    And caregiving prevents full-time employment\n    When the community_elohim assesses economic support needs\n    Then care token supplements should be available based on need\n    And community should provide financial support recognizing care work\n    And support should be dignified, not stigmatizing like charity\n    And care economy should function as economic justice system\n    And caregivers should not face poverty due to care contributions\n\n  Scenario: Community respite care accessible through care economy\n    Given James needs regular respite to prevent burnout\n    And formal respite care costs $20-30/hour he cannot afford\n    When James accesses community respite resources\n    Then his care token accumulation should subsidize respite costs\n    And community should provide respite care at accessible rates\n    And respite should be professional-quality and reliable\n    And care economy should ensure caregivers get necessary breaks\n    And community should invest in caregiver sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Community caregiver support networks connect isolated caregivers\n    Given James is profoundly isolated by intensive caregiving\n    And connection to other caregivers is essential for survival\n    When the community_elohim connects caregivers\n    Then James should access support groups for Alzheimer's caregivers\n    And he should connect with other sandwich generation caregivers\n    And he should find LGBTQ+ caregiver community if desired\n    And support networks should provide practical advice and emotional support\n    And community should actively prevent caregiver isolation\n\n  Scenario: Community medical equipment lending supported by care economy\n    Given David needs increasing assistive equipment as disease progresses\n    And purchasing equipment is financially impossible\n    When James needs medical equipment\n    Then the community_elohim should connect to equipment lending libraries\n    And his care contributions should give standing to access equipment\n    And borrowing should be dignified and based on care economy\n    And community should pool medical resources for caregiver access\n    And equipment access should reduce financial burden\n\n  Scenario: Community education recognizes invisible care economy scale\n    Given community members don't understand family caregiver reality\n    And invisibility perpetuates lack of support\n    When the community_elohim demonstrates care economy scale\n    Then it should show family caregivers provide $470 billion/year nationally\n    And it should quantify caregiving in local community specifically\n    And community should recognize dependence on invisible care work\n    And education should transform attitudes toward family caregiving\n    And visibility should drive policy changes supporting caregivers\n\n  Scenario: Community policy advocacy based on caregiver data\n    Given caregivers need employment protections and support policies\n    And policy requires data to demonstrate need\n    When the community_elohim aggregates caregiver data\n    Then it should demonstrate caregiving scope in community\n    And data should support advocacy for caregiver leave policies\n    And it should show economic impact of unsupported caregiving\n    And community should advocate for caregivers at policy level\n    And care economy data should drive systemic change\n\n  Scenario: Community crisis support for caregiver emergencies\n    Given caregiving crises can become tragedies quickly\n    And James could reach complete burnout or medical emergency\n    When the community_elohim detects caregiver crisis\n    Then it should provide immediate crisis intervention\n    And emergency respite care should be available immediately\n    And medical support should be accessible for caregiver health\n    And community should have safety net for caregiver collapse\n    And crisis detection should prevent tragedy\n\n  Scenario: Community food security for caregiver households\n    Given James's household faces food insecurity on reduced income\n    And care demands make food shopping difficult\n    When the community_elohim assesses food security\n    Then food assistance should be available through care economy\n    And delivery should accommodate caregiver constraints\n    And food should meet David's specialized nutritional needs\n    And access should be dignified and based on care contributions\n    And community should ensure caregiver households have food security\n\n  Scenario: Community transportation support for medical appointments\n    Given James must coordinate multiple medical appointments\n    And transportation logistics are overwhelming\n    When the community_elohim organizes transportation support\n    Then volunteer drivers should be available for medical appointments\n    And transportation should accommodate David's cognitive needs\n    And scheduling should be reliable for multiple appointments\n    And community should reduce transportation burden\n    And medical access should not require James to manage everything alone\n\n  Scenario: Community legal aid for caregiver navigation needs\n    Given James needs advance directives, power of attorney, possibly guardianship\n    And legal services are expensive and complex\n    When the community_elohim connects to legal resources\n    Then legal aid should be accessible based on care contributions\n    And attorneys should understand caregiver-specific needs\n    And legal navigation should be supported through care economy\n    And community should ensure caregivers access legal protections\n    And legal complexity should not be impossible barrier\n\n  Scenario: Community future planning supports caregiver sustainability\n    Given James's caregiving could last years or decades\n    And he needs to build future care economy resources\n    When James plans for long-term sustainability\n    Then the community_elohim should track his accumulating care contributions\n    And his care tokens should build toward future when he may need care\n    And community should recognize caregiving as investment in mutual aid\n    And care economy should function across decades, not just immediate needs\n    And James should build care economy standing for his own future vulnerability\n",
