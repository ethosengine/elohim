Community-Level Appeal Process for Appellant\n  As an appellant in the governance system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want rapid, accessible appeals for Community Elohim decisions\n  So that local governance remains responsive and accountable to community members\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the appellant user is registered in the system\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And Community Elohim provides first-layer appeal review for Family Elohim decisions\n\n  Scenario: First-layer appeal review within 24 hours\n    Given I appealed my Family Elohim's decision about mental health intervention\n    When Community Elohim conducts first-layer appeal review\n    Then the review happens within 24 hours of my appeal filing\n    And Community Elohim examines if Family Elohim decision was appropriate for local context\n    And They consider community resources available (mental health services, support networks)\n    And They evaluate if local cultural norms were respected\n    And They provide transparent reasoning for their review decision\n    And Most appeals are resolved at this layer through clarification or correction\n    And I receive immediate notification of the review outcome\n\n  Scenario: Community Elohim identifies clear error in Family Elohim decision\n    Given my Family Elohim made a decision based on incorrect data\n    And I appealed pointing out the factual error\n    When Community Elohim reviews the appeal\n    Then they quickly identify the error in the original decision\n    And The decision is immediately corrected\n    And My preferences or outcomes are restored to proper state\n    And Family Elohim updates its reasoning based on correct information\n    And The error pattern is flagged for protocol improvement\n    And I receive apology and explanation of what went wrong\n\n  Scenario: Appeal reveals need for community-specific calibration\n    Given I appeal a privacy threshold that feels too low for my community\n    And multiple community members have filed similar appeals\n    When Community Constitutional Council reviews the pattern\n    Then they recognize this as community-wide concern not individual complaint\n    And They recommend community-specific calibration of privacy thresholds\n    And Community leader facilitates deliberation on local preferences\n    And Community residents participate in calibrating the protocol\n    And My appeal contributes to community self-governance\n    And Local sovereignty is exercised within constitutional bounds\n\n  Scenario: Appealing community resource allocation decision\n    Given Community Elohim denied my small business loan application\n    And I believe the criteria were unfairly applied\n    When I appeal the economic decision\n    Then Community Constitutional Council reviews the resource allocation\n    And They evaluate if constitutional principles of care and equity were followed\n    And They examine if I had meaningful opportunity to present my case\n    And They consider community economic context and priorities\n    And They assess if the agent's risk analysis was sound or biased\n    And The appeal can result in decision reversal or modified evaluation criteria\n    And Local economic priorities are clarified through appeal precedents\n\n  Scenario: Appeal includes community context testimony\n    Given I filed an appeal that requires local knowledge to understand\n    And the Constitutional Council needs community context\n    When Community Leader provides testimony about local circumstances\n    Then the leader explains relevant history, cultural factors, and relationships\n    And The context helps council understand what might seem unusual to outsiders\n    And The leader doesn't advocate for outcome, just provides information\n    And The council weighs local context alongside constitutional principles\n    And Community knowledge enriches constitutional interpretation\n    And My appeal benefits from those who understand our community deeply\n\n  Scenario: Unsuccessful appeal but protocol transparency builds trust\n    Given my appeal was reviewed and the agent's decision was affirmed\n    And I didn't get the outcome I wanted\n    When I receive the Constitutional Council's detailed reasoning\n    Then I can see that my appeal was genuinely considered not dismissed\n    And I understand the constitutional principles that were applied\n    And I see how my case compares to similar precedents\n    And I know I had meaningful recourse even though I didn't prevail\n    And The transparency helps me trust the process even in defeat\n    And Trust in community governance is maintained through honest engagement\n\n  Scenario: Appeal of community surveillance or monitoring practices\n    Given I believe Community Elohim monitors community members too intrusively\n    And I am concerned about surveillance overreach\n    When I appeal the monitoring practices\n    Then Constitutional Council evaluates if surveillance exceeds constitutional minimums\n    And They examine if monitoring serves legitimate care purposes\n    And They consider if less invasive methods could achieve same goals\n    And They assess if community members have visibility into what's monitored\n    And They evaluate if appeal and recourse mechanisms are working properly\n    And The appeal protects community from surveillance creep\n    And Privacy boundaries are actively defended not passively eroded\n\n  Scenario: Appealing community conflict mediation outcome\n    Given Community Elohim mediated a conflict between me and neighbors\n    And I believe the proposed resolution is unjust\n    When I appeal the mediation outcome\n    Then Constitutional Council reviews if mediation process was fair\n    And They evaluate if all parties had meaningful voice\n    And They examine if constitutional principles guided the resolution\n    And They consider if community harmony was balanced with individual justice\n    And They assess if cultural conflict resolution norms were respected\n    And The appeal can modify the resolution or offer alternative mediation\n    And Community learns how to balance harmony with individual rights\n\n  Scenario: Multiple appellants challenge same community decision\n    Given several community members appeal the same Community Elohim decision\n    And we all believe a community resource decision was unjust\n    When Constitutional Council reviews the multiple related appeals\n    Then they treat this as collective concern requiring community deliberation\n    And They evaluate if the decision violated community consensus\n    And They examine if community participation in the decision was adequate\n    And They may convene community assembly to deliberate the issue\n    And The appeals trigger democratic engagement not just individual recourse\n    And Community governance evolves through collective voice\n\n  Scenario: Appeal escalation path when community review insufficient\n    Given Community Elohim review upheld the original decision\n    And I remain convinced my constitutional rights were violated\n    When I choose to escalate beyond community layer\n    Then I can request peer agent review (three Family Elohim from other families)\n    And If still unsatisfied, I can escalate to Regional Constitutional Council\n    And Each layer brings fresh perspective and greater scrutiny\n    And The escalation path is accessible without legal expertise\n    And Timelines are maintained (peer review within 1 week, regional within 1 month)\n    And Higher layers don't just rubber-stamp lower decisions\n    And Genuine independent review happens at each escalation level\n\n  Scenario: Community appeal informs local policy development\n    Given my appeal revealed gaps in how Community Elohim handles certain situations\n    And Constitutional Council made recommendations for improvement\n    When Community Leader reviews appeal patterns and recommendations\n    Then the leader brings findings to city council for policy response\n    And Local ordinances may be updated to clarify boundaries\n    And Community protocol calibration may be proposed\n    And My individual appeal contributes to broader community governance\n    And Democratic feedback loop connects appeals to policy improvement\n    And Community becomes more responsive through listening to dissent\n",
