  "content": "Feature: Household Governance and Coordination During Temporary Vulnerability\n  As a person rebuilding household stability after crisis\n  I want tools to coordinate household operations and children's needs\n  So that I can provide good care despite overwhelming constraints and create new stability\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am managing a household in crisis or transition\n    And I am coordinating children's needs amid instability\n    And my household resources are severely constrained\n    And I am using the Value Scanner to manage household complexity\n\n  Scenario: Managing catastrophically tight household budget\n    Given I have temporary assistance, unreliable child support, and no employment yet\n    And I need to provide for two children on insufficient resources\n    When I plan household spending for the month\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me allocate resources across competing needs\n    And prioritizes nutrition, safety, and children's essential needs\n    And surfaces local resources and assistance I might be eligible for\n    And helps me track spending without shame or judgment\n    And identifies where I can optimize without sacrificing children's wellbeing\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to upcoming expenses before they become crises\n    And recognizes my resource management as sophisticated financial labor\n    And validates that I'm making the best possible choices under extreme constraint\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating children's basic needs amid housing instability\n    Given I am in transitional housing with uncertain future\n    And my children need stability, routine, and predictability\n    When I plan daily and weekly household operations\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me maintain consistency where possible\n    And tracks children's schedules, needs, and preferences\n    And helps me create portable routines that work across housing changes\n    And surfaces strategies for stability even in unstable circumstances\n    And coordinates meal planning with catastrophically limited budget\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of important household tasks\n    And recognizes my household management as substantial care work\n    And celebrates the stability I'm providing under impossible conditions\n\n  Scenario: Creating new household norms and governance after leaving abuse\n    Given my household previously operated under abusive dynamics\n    And I am rebuilding household culture based on safety and respect\n    When I establish new household rules and norms\n    Then the Value Scanner supports my authority as household decision-maker\n    And helps me create age-appropriate structures for children\n    And documents household agreements and expectations\n    And tracks what's working and what needs adjustment\n    And provides resources on healthy household dynamics\n    And my personal_agent reminds household members of established norms\n    And validates that rebuilding takes time and iteration\n    And recognizes my household governance work as valuable labor\n\n  Scenario: Managing children's trauma responses and behavioral challenges\n    Given my children are exhibiting trauma responses from abuse and instability\n    And I am also traumatized and resource-depleted\n    When challenging behaviors arise in household\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me track patterns and triggers\n    And surfaces trauma-informed parenting strategies\n    And connects me to appropriate support services for children\n    And validates that these challenges are normal responses to abnormal circumstances\n    And helps me maintain patience and compassion despite stress\n    And my personal_agent provides in-the-moment coaching when I'm struggling\n    And documents my sophisticated trauma-responsive parenting\n    And recognizes this emotional labor as substantial care contribution\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating household operations while navigating legal system\n    Given I have family court hearings, protective order renewals, and legal appointments\n    And household operations must continue despite legal demands\n    When I manage competing priorities of legal navigation and household needs\n    Then the Value Scanner coordinates across both domains\n    And ensures children's needs don't fall through cracks during legal crisis\n    And tracks legal deadlines without letting household management suffer\n    And helps me prepare for legal events while maintaining household stability\n    And my personal_agent balances urgent legal tasks with ongoing household care\n    And surfaces support for children during particularly stressful legal periods\n    And recognizes that managing both is extraordinary organizational labor\n    And prevents either domain from overwhelming the other\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining children's nutrition on catastrophically limited food budget\n    Given I have approximately $X per week for groceries\n    And I need to provide nutritious meals for growing children\n    When I plan household meals and shopping\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me maximize nutrition within extreme constraints\n    And surfaces local food assistance programs and resources\n    And provides meal planning that works with my cooking capacity and time\n    And helps me

during crisis transitions (shelter to housing, housing to housing)\n    Given I am moving from transitional housing to permanent housing\n    And household operations must continue during major disruption\n    When I coordinate the moving transition\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me manage transition logistics\n    And maintains children's routines as much as possible during chaos\n

appropriate responsibility as sophisticated parenting\n    And supports healthy household participation for all members\n\n  Scenario: Managing household privacy and safety boundaries\n    Given I have safety concerns about my abuser finding me\n    And household information could compromise our safety\n    When I manage household information sharing\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me control

left my previous household with minimal possessions\n    And I am rebuilding household from nearly nothing\n    When I work to acquire essential household items\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me

stressed, and exhausted\n    And household operations require consistent energy and attention\n    When I allocate my limited capacity across household demands\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me
