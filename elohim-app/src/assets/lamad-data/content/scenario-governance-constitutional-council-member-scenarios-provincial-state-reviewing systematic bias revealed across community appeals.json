  "content": "Scenario: Reviewing systematic bias revealed across community appeals\n    Given researcher identified pattern of biased agent decisions\n    And multiple similar appeals came from affected communities\n    When we treat this as systemic review not individual cases\n    Then we investigate: if protocol implementation has regional problems\n    And we examine: if certain demographics are disadvantaged\n    And we consult: researchers on the pattern data\n    And we may order: regional protocol audit or recalibration\n    And we address: structural injustice not just individual grievances\n    And we demonstrate: constitutional accountability works at scale\n    And we prevent: systemic violations through democratic oversight\n",
