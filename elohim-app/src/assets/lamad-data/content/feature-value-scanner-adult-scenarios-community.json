Community Layer Value Recognition for Adult\n  As an adult participating in community governance\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want my care contributions to create community resilience\n  So that community resources and leadership reflect demonstrated care work\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the adult user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah actively participates in community care economy\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates community-level care\n    And community includes schools, food cooperatives, civic organizations\n\n  Scenario: Community care contributions qualify Sarah for leadership\n    Given Sarah has accumulated substantial care contributions\n    And community leadership positions require demonstrated commitment\n    When community selects leaders\n    Then Sarah's quantified care work should be visible evidence\n    And her school involvement should be tracked\n    And her food cooperative participation should be recognized\n    And her community organizing should be valued\n    And leadership should go to those who demonstrate care, not just those who talk\n    And care economy should create accountability in community governance\n\n  Scenario: School involvement recognized as substantial care work\n    Given Sarah is actively involved in her children's school\n    And she volunteers in classrooms, organizes events, advocates for policies\n    When community care contributions are tracked\n    Then the community_elohim should quantify Sarah's school involvement\n    And volunteer hours should be valued as care work\n    And parent advocacy should be recognized as community contribution\n    And school participation should give Sarah voice in educational governance\n    And care for education should be visible and valued\n\n  Scenario: Food cooperative participation builds community food security\n    Given Sarah participates in community food cooperative\n    And she contributes labor to collective food purchasing\n    When food cooperative operates\n    Then the community_elohim should track Sarah's contributions\n    And it should coordinate cooperative logistics\n    And it should connect Sarah to other food security advocates\n    And cooperative should reduce costs for all members\n    And community food security should be built through care economy\n    And Sarah's contributions should be recognized and valued\n\n  Scenario: Community care tokens enable resource access based on contribution\n    Given Sarah has accumulated care tokens through community participation\n    And community resources are allocated based on care contributions\n    When Sarah needs community support\n    Then her care tokens should give her access to resources\n    And community mutual aid should be available\n    And support should be based on demonstrated contribution\n    And care economy should function as community resource system\n    And Sarah's care work should have tangible value\n\n  Scenario: Community organizations coordinate through care economy principles\n    Given Sarah participates in multiple community organizations\n    And these organizations share care economy values\n    When community organizations coordinate activities\n    Then the community_elohim should facilitate coordination\n    And it should prevent Sarah from being overcommitted\n    And it should enable meaningful contribution across organizations\n    And community sector should adopt care economy practices\n    And organizational effectiveness should improve through coordination\n\n  Scenario: Community policy advocacy informed by care economy data\n    Given Sarah advocates for community policy changes\n    And data about care work supports policy arguments\n    When Sarah engages in advocacy\n    Then the community_elohim should provide aggregated care economy data\n    And Sarah should show that care work is substantial and invisible\n    And policy discussions should be informed by actual care patterns\n    And advocacy should be strengthened by quantified evidence\n    And care economy data should transform policy debates\n\n  Scenario: Community mutual aid network provides support during crisis\n    Given Sarah or community members may face crises\n    And traditional systems often fail to provide adequate support\n    When Sarah experiences job loss, health emergency, or family crisis\n    Then the community_elohim should connect her to mutual aid network\n    And support should be immediate, dignified, and effective\n    And community should function as safety net\n    And Sarah's previous contributions should enable access to help\n    And mutual aid should be reciprocal and community-based\n\n  Scenario: Community care economy includes diverse cultural approaches\n    Given Sarah's community includes diverse cultural backgrounds\n    And different cultures have different care economy traditions\n    When community care economy operates\n    Then the community_elohim should respect cultural diversity\n    And it should accommodate different care practices\n    And it should not impose single cultural framework\n    And diverse approaches should be honored and integrated\n    And community care economy should be culturally adaptive\n\n  Scenario: Preventing Sarah's overcommitment through community coordination\n    Given Sarah is highly engaged in community\n    And she tends to say yes to too many requests\n    When community organizations ask Sarah to contribute\n    Then the community_elohim should track her total commitments\n    And it should warn Sarah when she's approaching overcommitment\n    And it should help her maintain sustainable participation\n    And community should benefit from Sarah's long-term engagement\n    And burnout should be prevented through coordination\n\n  Scenario: Community resource sharing reduces individual costs at scale\n    Given community members have complementary needs and resources\n    And collective action can reduce costs significantly\n    When community organizes resource sharing\n    Then the community_elohim should coordinate tool libraries\n    And it should facilitate skill sharing networks\n    And it should organize bulk purchasing cooperatives\n    And community members should benefit economically from cooperation\n    And care economy should provide material benefits, not just recognition\n\n  Scenario: Community care contributions connect to municipal governance\n    Given Sarah's community care work is substantial\n    And municipal policy affects community well-being\n    When municipal governance decisions are made\n    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her voice\n    And community care economy data should inform municipal policy\n    And care work should be recognized at municipal level\n    And Sarah's advocacy should carry weight based on demonstrated contribution\n    And care economy should scale from community to municipal governance\n\n  Scenario: Community privacy protects members while enabling coordination\n    Given community care economy involves data about many people\n    And privacy must be protected rigorously\n    When community care patterns are tracked\n    Then the community_elohim should only share aggregated data\n    And individual household details should remain private\n    And Sarah should control what community sees about her family\n    And community coordination should not require privacy sacrifice\n    And data should serve community well-being, not surveillance\n\n  Scenario: Community care economy demonstrates alternative to extraction economics\n    Given Sarah's community has adopted care economy practices\n    And mainstream economics devalue care work\n    When community care economy becomes visible\n    Then it should demonstrate that alternatives to capitalism are viable\n    And it should show care work creates real value\n    And it should inspire other communities to adopt similar practices\n    And Sarah's community should serve as model\n    And care economy transformation should spread through demonstrated success\n",
