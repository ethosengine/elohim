  "content": "Scenario: Accessing neighborhood food assistance with dignity\n    Given I need supplemental food support beyond my grocery budget\n    And neighborhood has food pantries, community meals, or assistance programs\n    When I seek food assistance in my neighborhood\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me locate and access food resources\n    And provides information about pantry hours, requirements, and culture\n    And prepares me for what to expect to reduce anxiety\n    And frames food assistance as community care economy, not charity\n    And tracks my care contributions that create standing for support\n    And my personal_agent helps me navigate first visits\n    And recognizes accessing help as strength, not failure\n    And connects me to most dignity-preserving food resources\n",
