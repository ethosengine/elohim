  "content": "Scenario: Managing boundaries with extended family members aligned with abuser\n    Given some extended family members (potentially abuser's family, some of my family) excuse or minimize abuse\n    And I need to protect myself and children from these relationships\n    When problematic family members attempt contact or involvement\n    Then the family_elohim helps me maintain firm boundaries\n    And provides language for declining contact or setting limits\n    And tracks boundary violations for safety purposes\n    And supports me in limiting children's contact when appropriate\n    And helps me navigate family pressure to reconcile or minimize abuse\n    And my personal_agent validates that protecting my household is my right\n    And recognizes boundary enforcement as essential protective labor\n    And supports me saying \"no\" to family expectations that endanger wellbeing\n",
