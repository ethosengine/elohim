  "content": "Scenario: Homework support expectations realistic for single parent households\n    Given Maria manages homework support for three children across different grade levels\n    And she does this after full workday while managing dinner, household, and bedtime\n    When schools assign homework requiring parent support\n    Then the educational_elohim should advocate for realistic homework expectations\n    And assignments should not assume extensive parent availability or expertise\n    And schools should recognize single parents have limited capacity to support homework\n    And children should not be penalized for single parent's time constraints\n    And homework policies should account for diverse family circumstances\n",
