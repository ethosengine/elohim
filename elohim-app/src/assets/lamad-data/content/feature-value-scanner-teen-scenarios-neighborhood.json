Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Teen\n  As a teen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want to participate actively in neighborhood-level care patterns\n  So that I learn how communities function and contribute to collective neighborhood flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teen user \"Jasmine\" is registered in the system\n    And Jasmine is 16 years old\n    And she lives in the Riverside neighborhood\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates collective care patterns\n    And Jasmine's personal_agent communicates with neighborhood_elohim\n\n  Scenario: Teen participates in neighborhood care patterns as full member\n    Given Jasmine's neighborhood has established care economy practices\n    And she has accumulated care contributions across contexts\n    When Jasmine engages neighborhood-level activities\n    Then she should be recognized as a full participant, not a future member\n    And her care contributions should aggregate with neighbors' contributions\n    And she should have access to neighborhood collective resources\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize her as a constitutional participant\n    And her voice should matter in neighborhood decisions\n    And she should experience being a valued member of her neighborhood community\n\n  Scenario: Teen coordinates with neighbors for mutual benefit\n    Given Jasmine's neighbor Mrs. Rodriguez is elderly and has limited mobility\n    And Jasmine regularly does grocery shopping\n    When Jasmine offers to shop for Mrs. Rodriguez\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate the coordination\n    And track Jasmine's care contribution to neighborhood care economy\n    And enable Mrs. Rodriguez to reciprocate through care tokens or other care\n    And build neighborhood bonds through visible care exchange\n    And demonstrate that care economy operates across age groups\n    And recognize that Jasmine's care work has real value to neighborhood wellbeing\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood food access improved by teen participation\n    Given Jasmine has knowledge of good deals and food sources\n    And she is mobile and has time flexibility\n    When she shares food access information through neighborhood networks\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should aggregate and distribute her knowledge\n    And other neighbors should benefit from her market research\n    And her contributions to collective food literacy should be recognized\n    And neighborhood food security should improve through shared intelligence\n    And Jasmine should learn that her knowledge is valuable to the community\n    And information sharing should be recognized as care contribution\n\n  Scenario: Teen builds peer networks for collective care economy\n    Given Jasmine has friends and peers in the neighborhood\n    And they are all learning care economy practices\n    When Jasmine coordinates with peers for mutual support\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate peer-to-peer care\n    And teens should be able to exchange care tokens without adult mediation\n    And peer networks should operate horizontally as valid care economy\n    And collective buying, skill sharing, and mutual aid should be supported\n    And Jasmine should learn that care economy works at her generation's scale\n    And peer care networks should build social capital and community resilience\n\n  Scenario: Teen participates in neighborhood safety and social cohesion\n    Given Jasmine is present in the neighborhood frequently\n    And neighborhood safety depends on collective awareness\n    When Jasmine contributes to neighborhood social cohesion\n    Then her participation in neighborhood events should be tracked\n    And her relationships with neighbors across age groups should be valued\n    And her presence and engagement should contribute to perceived safety\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize social capital building as care work\n    And Jasmine should understand that community safety is collective care labor\n    And her generation should be seen as contributors to neighborhood wellbeing, not problems to manage\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood collective resources accessible to teen based on contribution\n    Given the neighborhood has established collective resources\n    And Jasmine has accumulated substantial care contributions\n    When she needs to access neighborhood resources\n    Then her care contributions should give her standing to access shared resources\n    And she should be able to use neighborhood tool library, shared equipment, or collective resources\n    And access should be based on demonstrated participation, not age\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize her as a contributor with legitimate access\n    And she should learn that care economy operates on reciprocity, not charity\n    And her care tokens should be valid currency in neighborhood exchanges\n\n  Scenario: Teen voice included in neighborhood decision-making\n    Given the neighborhood is making decisions about shared spaces\n    And Jasmine uses neighborhood facilities and public spaces\n    When neighborhood_elohim facilitates decision processes\n    Then Jasmine's input should be solicited and valued\n    And youth voice should be recognized as legitimate in neighborhood governance\n    And her care contributions should give her standing in community decisions\n    And she should not be dismissed due to age\n    And the neighborhood should model inclusive governance that values all members\n    And Jasmine should learn that she has legitimate voice in shaping her community\n\n  Scenario: Teen identifies neighborhood needs and initiates responses\n    Given Jasmine notices the neighborhood lacks safe spaces for younger children\n    And she has capacity and interest to address this need\n    When she proposes organizing a neighborhood play supervision rotation\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should support her initiative\n    And facilitate coordination with other neighbors\n    And recognize her leadership and care contribution\n    And provide tools for organizing collective action\n    And demonstrate that teens can initiate community improvements\n    And build her capability for civic leadership and community organizing\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood bulk buying coordinated with teen participation\n    Given Jasmine's neighborhood organizes collective bulk food purchases\n    And she has transportation and time flexibility\n    When she participates in bulk buying coordination\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate logistics\n    And track her contributions of labor (pickup, distribution, coordination)\n    And enable cost savings to be distributed equitably\n    And recognize that her participation makes bulk buying possible for others\n    And demonstrate that care economy creates real economic value\n    And show that youth participation strengthens neighborhood economic resilience\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns neighborhood governance through participation\n    Given Jasmine is preparing for adult civic engagement\n    And neighborhood is a foundational governance layer\n    When she participates in neighborhood care economy\n    Then she should learn how neighborhoods function as governance units\n    And understand how collective decisions are made\n    And practice participating in community conversations\n    And build relationships with neighbors across differences\n    And develop civic skills that will serve her adult life\n    And internalize that communities require active participation to flourish\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care patterns prevent teen isolation\n    Given Jasmine could experience typical teen social isolation\n    And care economy creates connection across age groups\n    When she participates in neighborhood care patterns\n    Then she should build relationships with neighbors beyond her peer group\n    And experience being known and valued by her community\n    And have access to support beyond her immediate family\n    And develop sense of belonging to neighborhood community\n    And learn that care economy builds social fabric\n    And experience reduced isolation through meaningful community connection\n\n  Scenario: Teen contributes to neighborhood ecological stewardship\n    Given Jasmine's neighborhood has collective garden spaces\n    And environmental stewardship is part of neighborhood care economy\n    When Jasmine contributes to neighborhood composting or garden maintenance\n    Then her ecological care work should be tracked and valued\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize environmental labor\n    And she should learn that care extends to land and ecological systems\n    And neighborhood food production should be understood as collective care work\n    And her generation should develop expectation that communities steward their environment\n    And ecological care should be integrated with social and economic care\n",
