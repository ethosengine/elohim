  "content": "Scenario: Maintaining family care relationships despite geographic distance\n    Given Kenji lives 300 miles from family\n    And he cannot provide daily in-person care or support\n    When the family_elohim tracks Kenji's family contributions\n    Then it should recognize remote emotional support as care work\n    And it should value video calls with parents as connection labor\n    And it should track time spent supporting younger siblings remotely\n    And geographic distance should not make contributions invisible\n    And the system should recognize digital care as real care\n    And family connection across distance should be valued\n",
