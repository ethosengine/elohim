  "content": "Scenario: Community resource sharing networks reduce regional consumption\n    Given Maria participates in tool libraries, clothing swaps, and resource sharing\n    And these networks reduce overall community consumption\n    When bioregional resource flows are tracked\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should quantify community sharing impact\n    And it should recognize Maria's participation in community resource efficiency\n    And sharing networks should be valued as bioregional resilience building\n    And community cooperation should be celebrated as ecological practice\n    And Maria should see her participation as regional sustainability contribution\n",
