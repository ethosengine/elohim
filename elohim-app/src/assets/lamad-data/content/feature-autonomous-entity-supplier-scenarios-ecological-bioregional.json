Regenerative Agriculture and Bioregional Food System Stewardship\n  As a supplier in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the ecological_bioregional governance layer\n  I want to practice regenerative agriculture coordinated bioregionally\n  So that food system serves ecological health and climate resilience\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Johnson Farm operates within a bioregional ecological context\n    And the ecological_bioregional governance context is active\n    And democratic network enables bioregional coordination for sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Fair pricing enables transition from extractive to regenerative agriculture\n    Given corporate food system made regenerative practices financially impossible\n    And Tom wanted to build soil health but thin margins prevented investment\n    When democratic network pays sustainability premium for regenerative practices\n    Then crop rotation becomes economically viable through diversified revenue\n    And cover cropping is compensated as soil-building investment\n    And reduced tillage practices are supported despite initial yield reduction\n    And regenerative agriculture is profitable, not costly burden\n    And bioregional_elohim documents regenerative practice adoption and soil health improvements\n\n  Scenario: Carbon sequestration through farming is measured and valued\n    Given industrial agriculture is net carbon emitter through fossil inputs and soil degradation\n    And regenerative agriculture sequesters carbon through soil building\n    When democratic network values and compensates carbon sequestration\n    Then soil carbon is measured showing annual sequestration increases\n    And carbon sequestration is compensated through premium pricing or carbon credits\n    And farm becomes climate solution, not climate problem\n    And documented carbon impacts inform bioregional climate strategy\n    And bioregional_elohim tracks carbon sequestration across democratic farm network\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional crop diversity protects against climate disruption\n    Given monoculture agriculture is vulnerable to climate shocks\n    And bioregional food security requires diverse production\n    When democratic farms coordinate bioregional crop diversity\n    Then multiple farms grow complementary crops reducing systemic risk\n    And crop failures at one farm are buffered by others' success\n    And regional food security is protected through diversity\n    And climate resilience increases through bioregional coordination\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates crop diversity planning across farms\n\n  Scenario: Watershed protection becomes shared bioregional responsibility\n    Given agricultural runoff affects water quality throughout watershed\n    And individual farms lack resources or incentives to protect water comprehensively\n    When bioregional democratic network coordinates watershed stewardship\n    Then farms across watershed implement water protection practices (buffer strips, reduced chemicals)\n    And water quality monitoring shows improvement from coordinated stewardship\n    And downstream communities benefit from agricultural water protection\n    And watershed health becomes collective responsibility with visible benefits\n    And bioregional_elohim monitors watershed health and coordinates protection efforts\n\n  Scenario: Biodiversity preservation is integrated into agricultural practice\n    Given industrial agriculture destroys biodiversity through monoculture and chemicals\n    And biodiversity loss threatens ecosystem resilience and pollination\n    When democratic farms prioritize biodiversity as ecological value\n    Then pollinator habitat is planted and protected across farms\n    And hedgerows and field margins support wildlife and beneficial insects\n    And native plant species are incorporated into farm landscapes\n    And biodiversity increases measurably through democratic agricultural stewardship\n    And bioregional_elohim tracks biodiversity indicators across farm network\n\n  Scenario: Seasonal bioregional coordination provides year-round local food supply\n    Given individual farms have limited seasonal production windows\n    And year-round local food requires bioregional coordination across climate zones\n    When democratic farms coordinate seasonal production bioregionally\n    Then farms in different microclimates provide sequential seasonal supply\n    And storage and preservation extend local food availability\n    And bioregional network reduces dependence on distant, fossil-fuel-intensive supply chains\n    And food miles decrease dramatically through bioregional coordination\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates seasonal planning and distribution logistics\n\n  Scenario: Soil health improvements are documented and knowledge is shared\n    Given soil degradation is systemic problem in industrial agriculture\n    And regenerative soil building requires knowledge and long-term commitment\n    When democratic farms document and share soil health practices\n    Then soil testing shows organic matter increases and biological activity improvements\n    And successful practices are shared across bioregional farm network\n    And soil health knowledge accumulates and spreads through democratic coordination\n    And bioregional soil regeneration accelerates through collective learning\n    And bioregional_elohim manages soil health documentation and knowledge sharing\n\n  Scenario: Pesticide reduction improves ecosystem and human health bioregionally\n    Given pesticide use harms pollinators, water quality, farmworker health, and ecosystems\n    And individual farms face pest pressure requiring coordinated management\n    When democratic farms coordinate integrated pest management bioregionally\n    Then pesticide use decreases through ecological pest control methods\n    And farmworker health improves from reduced chemical exposure\n    And pollinator populations recover from pesticide reduction\n    And ecosystem health improves measurably across bioregion\n    And bioregional_elohim tracks pesticide reduction and ecosystem health indicators\n\n  Scenario: Climate adaptation strategies are developed and shared bioregionally\n    Given climate change creates new agricultural challenges (droughts, floods, heat, pests)\n    And adaptation requires experimentation and knowledge sharing\n    When democratic farms collaborate on climate adaptation\n    Then drought-resistant varieties are tested and shared across network\n    And water conservation practices spread through successful demonstration\n    And extreme weather response strategies are coordinated bioregionally\n    And climate resilience increases through collaborative adaptation\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates climate adaptation research and implementation\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional food system reduces fossil fuel dependence dramatically\n    Given industrial food system depends on fossil fuels (synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, transportation)\n    And energy transition requires reducing agricultural fossil fuel use\n    When democratic bioregional food system prioritizes energy sustainability\n    Then local distribution eliminates long-haul transportation energy use\n    And organic practices reduce synthetic fertilizer dependence\n    And renewable energy powers farm operations and distribution\n    And food system fossil fuel use decreases 80%+ through bioregional coordination\n    And bioregional_elohim tracks energy use and transition to renewable sources\n\n  Scenario: Traditional and indigenous agricultural knowledge is honored and integrated\n    Given industrial agriculture dismissed traditional ecological knowledge\n    And indigenous and traditional practices often embody sustainable wisdom\n    When democratic bioregional network values diverse agricultural knowledge\n    Then indigenous crop varieties and cultivation methods are preserved and used\n    And traditional ecological knowledge informs climate adaptation and biodiversity\n    And elder farmers and indigenous practitioners share wisdom with network\n    And agricultural knowledge diversity strengthens bioregional resilience\n    And bioregional_elohim documents and preserves traditional agricultural knowledge\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional food system serves as climate resilience infrastructure\n    Given climate disruption threatens food security through crop failures and supply chain breakdown\n    And communities need resilient local food production capacity\n    When democratic bioregional farm network provides distributed food security\n    Then climate shocks are absorbed through network coordination\n    And crop failures at individual farms don't create community food insecurity\n    And bioregional food sovereignty provides climate resilience\n    And food security is protected as climate changes through democratic coordination\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates climate resilience and food security planning\n\n  Scenario: Ecosystem services from regenerative agriculture are measured and valued\n    Given regenerative farms provide ecosystem services (water filtration, carbon storage, biodiversity)\n    And these services traditionally went uncompensated despite community benefit\n    When bioregional network documents and values ecosystem services\n    Then water quality improvements from agricultural practices are measured and compensated\n    And habitat provision for wildlife and pollinators is documented and valued\n    And carbon sequestration generates revenue supporting regenerative practices\n    And ecosystem service value enables regenerative agriculture to outcompete extractive industrial model\n    And bioregional_elohim measures ecosystem services and facilitates compensation mechanisms\n",
