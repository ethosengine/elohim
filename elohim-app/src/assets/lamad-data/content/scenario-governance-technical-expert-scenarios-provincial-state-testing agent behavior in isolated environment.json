  "content": "Scenario: Testing agent behavior in isolated environment\n    Given council needs to understand counterfactual scenarios\n    And I can run agents in test environments\n    When I conduct controlled experiments for council\n    Then I test: what agent would decide if input X were different\n    And I verify: robustness of constitutional alignment\n    And I explore: boundary cases and edge conditions\n    And I provide: evidence grounded in testing not speculation\n    And I avoid: affecting production systems\n    And testing enables: informed judgment about agent behavior\n    And council decisions: rest on verified evidence\n",
