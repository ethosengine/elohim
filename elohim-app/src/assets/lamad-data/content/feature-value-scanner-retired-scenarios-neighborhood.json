Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person\n  As a retired person in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want my neighborhood contributions recognized and participation supported\n  So that I remain embedded in community life and help build neighborhood resilience\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the retired user \"Frank\" is registered in the system\n    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction\n    And Frank serves on his neighborhood council\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates neighborhood care economy\n    And Frank's time freedom enables substantial neighborhood participation\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood council service recognized as civic care contribution\n    Given Frank serves on his neighborhood council\n    And he attends meetings, participates in decisions, and contributes expertise\n    And council service requires time, knowledge, and commitment\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks civic participation\n    Then Frank's council service should be quantified as care labor\n    And meeting attendance and preparation time should be valued\n    And his construction expertise contributions should be recognized\n    And governance participation should accumulate care tokens\n    And Frank should experience himself as valued neighborhood leader\n    And civic engagement should be recognized as care economy contribution\n    And his voice in neighborhood governance should carry appropriate weight\n\n  Scenario: Accumulated community knowledge valued in neighborhood governance\n    Given Frank has lived in the neighborhood for decades\n    And he knows neighborhood history, patterns, and relationships\n    And institutional knowledge is valuable governance resource\n    When Frank participates in neighborhood decisions\n    Then his accumulated knowledge should be recognized and valued\n    And long-term perspective should inform neighborhood planning\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should surface relevant historical context\n    And Frank's memory of neighborhood patterns should guide policy\n    And elder knowledge should shape community decisions\n    And decades of participation should confer legitimate standing\n    And his experience should be actively sought, not marginalized\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood repairs and maintenance using construction skills\n    Given Frank has construction expertise\n    And neighborhoods need ongoing maintenance and repairs\n    And Frank's time freedom enables contribution\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates maintenance needs\n    Then it should connect Frank's skills to neighborhood repair opportunities\n    And coordinate small repair projects utilizing his expertise\n    And recognize his skilled labor as valuable contribution\n    And facilitate tool sharing and material coordination\n    And quantify the market value of construction skills applied\n    And enable Frank to contribute meaningfully to neighborhood quality\n    And his skills should serve collective neighborhood benefit\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care tokens reflect accumulated contributions\n    Given Frank contributes through council service, repairs, and relationship-building\n    And he's invested decades in neighborhood relationships\n    When the neighborhood_elohim calculates care tokens\n    Then tokens should accumulate from all Frank's neighborhood contributions\n    And governance participation, skilled labor, and social cohesion work should be valued\n    And accumulated tokens should represent neighborhood standing and resources\n    And Frank's contributions should create claims on neighborhood support\n    And the care economy should recognize long-term neighborhood investment\n    And his participation should be visible and celebrated\n\n  Scenario: Connecting retired residents for mutual support networks\n    Given Frank is one of several retired residents in the neighborhood\n    And retired people have time to build mutual support systems\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates among retired residents\n    Then it should help Frank connect with other retired neighbors\n    And facilitate mutual aid networks among those with time availability\n    And coordinate skill sharing across retired residents\n    And support check-in systems for isolated or vulnerable neighbors\n    And build neighborhood resilience through retired resident networks\n    And enable Frank to both give and receive neighborhood support\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood governance participation accessible to aging residents\n    Given Frank is aging and may have mobility or accessibility needs\n    And neighborhood governance should remain accessible\n    When Frank participates in neighborhood governance\n    Then meetings should be accessible (location, seating, acoustics)\n    And remote participation options should be available\n    And meeting materials should be provided in accessible formats\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate accessibility needs\n    And Frank should be able to participate fully despite aging\n    And governance access should be universal, not assuming youth\n    And his participation should be welcomed and supported\n\n  Scenario: Mentoring younger neighbors in practical skills and neighborhood knowledge\n    Given Frank has construction expertise and decades of neighborhood knowledge\n    And younger neighbors are establishing themselves in the community\n    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates mentoring\n    Then it should connect Frank to younger neighbors seeking skills\n    And coordinate skill-sharing for home repairs and maintenance\n    And facilitate neighborhood history and culture transmission\n    And recognize teaching and mentoring as care contributions\n    And build intergenerational neighborhood relationships\n    And value Frank's role in acculturating new residents\n    And strengthen neighborhood cohesion through knowledge sharing\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood emergency response utilizes retired residents' availability\n    Given Frank has daytime availability when many neighbors work\n    And neighborhoods need emergency response capacity\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates emergency preparedness\n    Then it should include Frank in neighborhood emergency plans\n    And utilize his construction skills for emergency assessment\n    And coordinate check-ins on vulnerable neighbors during crises\n    And recognize retired residents as neighborhood resilience resources\n    And Frank should feel valuable in emergency response role\n    And his availability should serve collective security\n    And neighborhood should benefit from his time flexibility\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood beautification and common space maintenance\n    Given Frank has time and skills to contribute to neighborhood spaces\n    And common spaces require ongoing care and maintenance\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates common space work\n    Then it should facilitate Frank's participation in beautification\n    And coordinate neighborhood workdays utilizing his skills\n    And recognize landscaping, repair, and maintenance as care labor\n    And value his contributions to neighborhood quality of life\n    And enable collective ownership of neighborhood commons\n    And Frank should experience meaningful contribution to place\n    And neighborhood should benefit from retired residents' time\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood social cohesion work valued as care contribution\n    Given Frank builds relationships across the neighborhood\n    And he organizes informal gatherings and supports connections\n    And social cohesion is essential neighborhood infrastructure\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks relationship-building work\n    Then Frank's social cohesion labor should be recognized\n    And organizing gatherings, welcoming newcomers, maintaining connections should be valued\n    And the invisible work of community-building should be quantified\n    And Frank should experience his relationship work as valuable contribution\n    And neighborhood resilience should be understood as built through care labor\n    And his decades of relationship investment should be visible\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing facilitated by retired residents' coordination\n    Given Frank has time to coordinate neighborhood resource sharing\n    And tool libraries, skill exchanges, and mutual aid require coordination\n    When the neighborhood_elohim supports resource sharing\n    Then it should enable Frank to help coordinate shared resources\n    And facilitate tool borrowing, skill trades, and favor exchanges\n    And recognize coordination labor as valuable care contribution\n    And reduce neighborhood consumption through effective sharing\n    And Frank's coordination work should build neighborhood resilience\n    And his time availability should serve collective resource efficiency\n\n  Scenario: Aging in place supported by neighborhood care infrastructure\n    Given Frank plans to age in his neighborhood\n    And neighborhoods can support aging in place through care economy\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates aging support\n    Then it should connect Frank to neighbors who can provide future support\n    And facilitate reciprocal care arrangements as needs change\n    And coordinate check-ins and assistance for aging residents\n    And Frank's current contributions should create future neighborhood support\n    And care reciprocity should operate at neighborhood scale\n    And aging in place should be supported through neighborhood care economy\n    And Frank should experience security in continuing neighborhood membership\n",
