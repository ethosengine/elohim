  "content": "Scenario: Food assistance programs accessed without stigma\n    Given Helen's $24k/year barely covers basic needs\n    And she needs food assistance to survive\n    When Helen accesses food programs through care economy\n    Then assistance should be presented as legitimate reciprocity\n    And no stigma should attach to receiving support\n    And her lifetime of contributions should frame current assistance\n    And food access should be coordinated through community_elohim\n    And dignity should be preserved throughout assistance\n    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy eliminates charity model\n    And Helen should receive support as right based on contributions, not as failure\n",
