Municipal Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult\n  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the municipal governance layer\n  I want to influence municipal policy and infrastructure based on my care economy experience\n  So that municipal systems better support families managing multigenerational care responsibilities\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the middle-aged user \"Robert\" is registered in the system\n    And Robert is 52 years old with decades of care economy experience\n    And the municipal governance context is active\n    And municipal_elohim coordinates municipal care economy infrastructure\n    And Robert pays property taxes and participates in municipal civic life\n\n  Scenario: Municipal elder care policy informed by caregiver experience\n    Given Robert coordinates care for parents ages 78 and 75\n    And he's navigated municipal elder care systems\n    And he understands what works and what's missing\n    When municipal_elohim connects his experience to policy development\n    Then it should channel his feedback to municipal elder care planning\n    And surface his expertise to municipal aging services\n    And help him advocate for caregiver support programs\n    And connect him to municipal boards and advisory committees\n    And ensure municipal policy reflects actual caregiver needs\n    And recognize that users of systems should shape policy\n    And build elder care infrastructure based on lived experience\n\n  Scenario: Municipal work-family policy advocacy based on personal navigation\n    Given Robert balances intense career demands with family care\n    And he's learned that work-family balance requires systemic support\n    And municipal policy can support or hinder work-family balance\n    When municipal_elohim supports his policy advocacy\n    Then it should connect him to municipal work-family policy development\n    And help him advocate for paid family leave, flexible work policies, and caregiver protections\n    And surface opportunities to testify or serve on municipal commissions\n    And recognize his experience as policy expertise\n    And channel his voice toward municipal employment standards\n    And build municipal support for working caregivers\n    And demonstrate that care economy requires policy transformation\n\n  Scenario: Municipal resource allocation reflects care economy priorities\n    Given Robert participates in municipal budget processes\n    And care economy principles should inform resource allocation\n    And municipal budgets often underfund care infrastructure\n    When municipal_elohim supports budget advocacy\n    Then it should help him understand municipal budget priorities\n    And surface opportunities to advocate for care infrastructure funding\n    And connect him to budget hearings and participatory budgeting\n    And help him articulate how care infrastructure serves community wellbeing\n    And support advocacy for elder care, childcare, and caregiver support funding\n    And build municipal budgets that prioritize care economy\n    And demonstrate that care should be public infrastructure priority\n\n  Scenario: Municipal planning includes middle-aged caregiver voice\n    Given Robert represents large demographic managing multigenerational care\n    And municipal planning often misses caregiver needs\n    And his experience could improve municipal systems\n    When municipal_elohim connects him to planning processes\n    Then it should identify municipal planning opportunities\n    And help him participate in comprehensive planning, transportation planning, and housing policy\n    And surface how planning decisions affect caregivers\n    And advocate for aging-in-place infrastructure, accessible transportation, and multigenerational housing\n    And ensure municipal planning reflects caregiver perspectives\n    And build municipalities that support care economy\n    And recognize that planning should serve actual resident needs\n\n  Scenario: Municipal aging infrastructure influenced by sandwich generation\n    Given Robert manages care for both aging parents and adult children\n    And he understands infrastructure needs across lifecycle\n    And municipal aging infrastructure often inadequate\n    When municipal_elohim supports aging infrastructure advocacy\n    Then it should connect Robert to municipal aging policy development\n    And help him advocate for adult day care, senior centers, home health support, and transportation\n    And surface gaps in current municipal aging infrastructure\n    And support him in testifying about infrastructure needs\n    And build municipal systems that support aging with dignity\n    And demonstrate that aging infrastructure benefits entire community\n    And create municipalities where aging is supported, not hidden\n\n  Scenario: Municipal civic participation valued as care contribution\n    Given Robert serves on municipal boards and commissions\n    And civic participation is care for community\n    And his service benefits all residents\n    When municipal_elohim tracks civic participation\n    Then it should recognize his municipal service as care contribution\n    And value civic participation in care token economy\n    And track his contributions: planning commission, park board, aging advisory committee\n    And demonstrate that governance participation is care work\n    And recognize that his civic service strengthens municipal care economy\n    And build culture where civic participation is valued as contribution\n    And support sustainable civic engagement without exploitation\n\n  Scenario: Municipal services coordinate for multigenerational family support\n    Given Robert's family needs span eldercare, young adult support, and household services\n    And municipal services are often siloed by department\n    And coordinated service delivery would better serve families\n    When municipal_elohim coordinates service delivery\n    Then it should help Robert navigate municipal services across departments\n    And connect aging services, youth programs, housing assistance, and employment support\n    And surface relevant municipal resources across his family's needs\n    And demonstrate how integrated service delivery serves families\n    And advocate for municipal coordination across service silos\n    And build municipal systems that recognize multigenerational family reality\n    And reduce burden of navigating fragmented municipal services\n\n  Scenario: Municipal data and transparency support informed civic participation\n    Given Robert participates in municipal governance\n    And effective participation requires access to information\n    And municipal data is often hard to access or understand\n    When municipal_elohim provides municipal data access\n    Then it should surface relevant municipal data for Robert's interests\n    And help him understand municipal budgets, demographics, and service utilization\n    And provide analysis tools for municipal information\n    And support informed civic participation through data transparency\n    And demonstrate that democratic governance requires accessible information\n    And build municipal transparency that enables resident engagement\n    And empower residents to participate meaningfully in governance\n\n  Scenario: Municipal tax policy connects to care economy investment\n    Given Robert pays substantial property and income taxes\n    And taxes should support care infrastructure\n    And he has voice in how tax revenue is used\n    When municipal_elohim connects taxation to care economy\n    Then it should help him understand how his taxes fund care infrastructure\n    And surface opportunities to advocate for care economy tax priorities\n    And connect him to municipal revenue and taxation policy discussions\n    And support advocacy for progressive taxation that funds care\n    And build municipal tax policy that supports care economy\n    And demonstrate that taxation is community investment in care\n    And recognize that taxpayers should shape spending priorities\n\n  Scenario: Municipal employer influenced through employee advocacy\n    Given municipal government is major employer\n    And Robert may work for municipality or know municipal employees\n    And municipal employment policy sets standards\n    When municipal_elohim supports workplace advocacy\n    Then it should recognize opportunities to influence municipal employment policy\n    And help Robert advocate for municipal employee work-family balance\n    And support municipal adoption of care economy employment practices\n    And demonstrate that municipal government should model care economy principles\n    And build municipal workplace that supports employee caregiving\n    And create demonstration that care-friendly employment is possible\n    And influence broader employment culture through municipal example\n\n  Scenario: Municipal sustainability and care economy integration\n    Given care economy and ecological sustainability are connected\n    And Robert's care practices affect environmental sustainability\n    And municipal sustainability policy should include care economy\n    When municipal_elohim connects care and sustainability\n    Then it should help Robert see connections between care economy and ecological sustainability\n    And support advocacy for municipal policy that integrates both\n    And recognize that care for people and care for planet are linked\n    And build municipal sustainability that includes care economy principles\n    And demonstrate that sustainable communities require care economy\n    And create municipalities that support both human and ecological flourishing\n    And recognize that his generation can integrate these priorities\n\n  Scenario: Municipal accountability to care economy principles\n    Given Robert and others participate in municipal care economy\n    And municipalities should be accountable to care principles\n    And municipal decisions affect care economy functioning\n    When municipal_elohim monitors municipal accountability\n    Then it should track whether municipal policy supports care economy\n    And surface when municipal decisions harm caregivers\n    And help Robert hold municipality accountable to care principles\n    And provide tools for monitoring municipal care economy performance\n    And support resident advocacy for accountability\n    And build municipal governance that serves care economy\n    And demonstrate that municipalities should be accountable to residents' care needs\n",
