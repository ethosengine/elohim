  "content": "Scenario: Reduced consumption wisdom from experience of less\n    Given Helen grew up with material scarcity\n    And she knows how to live well with less\n    When Helen shares wisdom about reduced consumption\n    Then her experience should inform degrowth and sustainability education\n    And consumer capitalism should be challenged by her lived alternative\n    And younger generations should learn that happiness doesn't require endless acquisition\n    And Helen should be valued for knowledge that contradicts market economics\n    And the protocol should surface elder wisdom about sufficiency\n    And ecological sustainability should learn from those who lived with less\n    And Helen's experience should teach that less can be enough\n",
