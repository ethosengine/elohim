Educational Layer Value Recognition for Senior\n  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want to continue learning and share accumulated knowledge\n  So that education is understood as lifelong and senior knowledge is valued and transmitted\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the senior

curiosity and time for learning\n    And education should continue throughout life\n    When the educational_elohim connects Margaret to learning opportunities\n    Then continuing education programs

And professional skills should be treated as community asset\n\n  Scenario: Teaching grandchildren as recognized educational contribution\n    Given Margaret teaches her grandchildren skills, values, and knowledge\n    And intergenerational knowledge transmission is educational labor\n    When the educational_elohim tracks Margaret's teaching\n    Then teaching grandchildren should be recognized

be tracked\n    And informal education should be valued alongside formal\n    And intergenerational teaching should be care economy category\n\n  Scenario: Community education and skill-sharing

Scenario: Learning new technology to stay connected\n    Given Margaret needs technology skills for modern life\n    And digital divide affects seniors disproportionately\n    When the

learn at her own pace\n    And technology should be taught as tool for connection and autonomy\n    And digital literacy should be senior right, not privilege\n    And education should prevent technology-based isolation\n\n  Scenario: Health literacy education empowers self-care\n    Given Margaret navigates complex health systems\n    And health literacy affects health outcomes\n    When the educational_elohim provides health education\n    Then Margaret should access senior-appropriate health information\n    And education should empower her health decision-making\n    And her nursing background should be acknowledged\n    And health literacy should support active aging\n    And education should enhance autonomy in health care\n    And Margaret should be informed patient and advocate\n\n  Scenario: Financial and resource management education for fixed income\n    Given Margaret manages limited resources\n    And financial literacy supports economic security\n    When the educational_elohim provides financial education\n    Then senior-specific financial planning should be available\n    And budget management on fixed income should be taught\n    And education should be empowering, not condescending\n    And Margaret should learn strategies for resource optimization\n    And financial literacy should support independence\n    And education should be practical and immediately applicable\n\n  Scenario: Peer-to-peer senior learning communities\n    Given seniors learn effectively from each other\n    And shared experience creates effective learning
