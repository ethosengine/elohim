  "content": "Scenario: Organizer mobilizes parents against school closure targeting low-income neighborhoods\n    Given district proposes closing three schools in working-class areas\n    And claims it's necessary for \"efficiency\"\n    When the organizer uses Observer to analyze closure impacts\n    Then they show closures increase commute times for low-income families\n    And demonstrate stable enrollment contradicting district claims\n    And calculate cost of closure to affected communities\n    And organize parents to demand community-based solutions\n    And education organizing prevents harm to vulnerable students\n",
