School District Governance for Elected Representative\n  As a politician in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the district governance layer\n  I want to understand district operations and community needs\n  So that I can govern complex education systems serving thousands of children effectively\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the politician user is registered in the system\n    And the district governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: School board member understands resource distribution across schools\n    Given the politician governs district with 40 schools\n    And limited visibility into daily school operations\n    When the Observer analyzes district resource patterns\n    Then they see experienced teachers concentrated in affluent area schools\n    And identify disparities in per-student spending across buildings\n    And learn which schools lack arts programs and advanced courses\n    And understand facility maintenance varies by neighborhood\n    And advocate for equitable resource distribution with evidence\n\n  Scenario: Board member evaluates superintendent budget proposal with impact analysis\n    Given administration proposes budget with cuts and reallocations\n    And presents optimistic framing of difficult trade-offs\n    When the Observer provides impact analysis\n    Then they see which students and schools bear burden of cuts\n    And understand transportation changes affect working parent schedules\n    And identify which programs lose funding versus protected priorities\n    And compare budget choices to similar districts\n    And ask informed questions challenging rosy assumptions\n\n  Scenario: School board member surfaces parent and teacher concerns at scale\n    Given the politician hears from vocal parents at board meetings\n    But suspects broader community has different priorities\n    When the Observer aggregates parent and teacher input\n    Then they see working parents can't attend evening meetings\n    And learn teachers face classroom supply shortages systematically\n    And identify parent concerns about mental health resources\n    And understand transportation reliability affects family schedules\n    And align policy with broader community needs beyond meeting attendees\n\n  Scenario: Board member tracks accountability for student outcome commitments\n    Given the politician pledged to improve reading proficiency\n    And committed to closing achievement gaps\n    When the Observer monitors outcome tracking\n    Then they see reading proficiency trends by school and demographic\n    And identify which interventions work versus ineffective programs\n    And receive alerts when metrics decline\n    And understand whether district implements promised reforms\n    And maintain accountability for student outcome commitments\n\n  Scenario: School board member distinguishes authentic parent concern from coordinated campaign\n    Given the politician receives mass emails opposing curriculum\n    And messages claim widespread parent outrage\n    When the Observer analyzes campaign origins\n    Then they see template messages from national advocacy organization\n    And identify 15 local parents among 300 emails\n    And distinguish coordinated political campaign from genuine community concern\n    And understand actual parent sentiment in district\n    And resist manipulation by outside political organizations\n\n  Scenario: Board member builds coalition for increased education funding\n    Given the politician seeks voter approval for tax levy\n    And needs broad community support\n    When the Observer identifies coalition potential\n    Then they see parents care about class sizes and programs\n    And identify business leaders concerned about workforce preparation\n    And connect with community organizations serving families\n    And facilitate coalition across diverse stakeholder groups\n    And build campaign for education investment with broad base\n\n  Scenario: School board member evaluates charter school proposal with evidence\n    Given charter organization proposes new school in district\n    And presents compelling student achievement promises\n    When the Observer analyzes charter track record\n    Then they see organization's student outcomes in other cities\n    And learn whether achievement gains account for selective enrollment\n    And understand fiscal impact on district schools\n    And review discipline and expulsion rates for vulnerable students\n    And make informed decision on charter authorization\n\n  Scenario: Board member monitors discipline disparities and pushes for equity\n    Given the politician committed to equitable school climate\n    When the Observer tracks discipline outcomes by demographics\n    Then they see Black students suspended at 3x rate of white students\n    And learn similar behaviors result in different consequences by race\n    And identify which schools have restorative practices versus zero-tolerance\n    And compare district patterns to best-practice districts\n    And champion policy reform for equitable discipline\n\n  Scenario: School board member understands transportation impact on families\n    Given administration proposes transportation cuts for budget savings\n    When the Observer analyzes transportation usage and impacts\n    Then they see which families depend on bus routes for work schedules\n    And identify students who will lose access without transportation\n    And understand time burdens on working parents from route changes\n    And calculate actual family costs of proposed savings\n    And evaluate trade-offs with family wellbeing impact visible\n\n  Scenario: Board member verifies administrator claims about state mandates\n    Given district administration claims state mandates prevent local changes\n    And politicians suspect bureaucratic resistance masked as legal constraint\n    When the Observer researches actual state requirements\n    Then they see what's legally required versus administrative preference\n    And identify how other districts handle same mandates differently\n    And distinguish genuine constraints from bureaucratic inertia\n    And push for changes within actual legal bounds\n    And hold administration accountable for implementation choices\n",
