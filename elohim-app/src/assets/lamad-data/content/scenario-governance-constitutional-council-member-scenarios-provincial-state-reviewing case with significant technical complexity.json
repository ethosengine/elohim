  "content": "Scenario: Reviewing case with significant technical complexity\n    Given appeal involves cryptographic verification questions\n    And I lack technical expertise to understand the details\n    When Dr. Okonkwo provides expert testimony\n    Then she explains: in language I can understand\n    And she shows: what can and cannot be technically verified\n    And she presents: competing expert interpretations\n    And she informs: without advocating for particular outcome\n    And I ask: questions until I understand enough to judge\n    And I weigh: technical information alongside human wisdom\n    And I decide: on constitutional alignment not technical optimization\n    And I honor: the boundary between expertise and judgment\n",
