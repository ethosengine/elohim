    "conclusion": "Taking a humanely oriented, complex systems perspective requires us to be \u201cepistemically humble\u201d and to accept the inherent uncertainty of living in a world in which everything is subject to change:\n\nOptimizing the parts doesn't always lead to optimization of the whole, especially in complex systems. As David Stroh wrote in Systems Thinking for Social Change:\n\n\u201cIn order to optimize the performance of the entire system, people need to shift from trying to optimize their part of the system to improving relationships among its constituent parts.\u201d\n\nHere, the \u201cwhole\u201d is how a technology impacts the user and their wider community. The \u201cparts\u201d are individual elements of the technology such as specific algorithms, features, and metrics. Technology teams must move in and out, from parts to whole and whole to parts, so that they can grow in their understanding of the technology's effect on individual users and communities.\n\nThis process is often under-appreciated and under-resourced. Ask yourself where you could investigate these types of relationships. This may entail expanding your role to be more cross-functional, or hiring a new person to take on that role. These types of jobs are not common, often because their contributions are not conveniently captured by simple metrics.\n\nSo let us reimagine measures of success based on the Fruits of the Spirit:\n\nLove:  \nShift focus from attendance numbers to meaningful relationships formed.  \nMeasure the number of reconciliations facilitated within the church and community.  \nTrack instances of sacrificial giving and service to those in need.\n\nJoy:  \nAssess the church's impact on mental health in the community.  \nMeasure participation in community celebrations and cultural events.  \nSurvey members' sense of purpose and fulfillment in their faith journey.\n\nPeace:  \nTrack resolution of conflicts within the church and wider community.  \nMeasure reduction in domestic violence rates in the church community.  \nAssess the church's involvement in local peacemaking initiatives.\n\nPatience:  \nEvaluate long-term commitment to discipleship and spiritual growth programs.  \nMeasure retention and growth of new believers over time.  \nAssess willingness to engage in long-term community development projects.\n\nKindness:  \nTrack acts of unexpected generosity by church members.  \nMeasure the church's welcome and support of marginalized groups.  \nAssess the church's environmental stewardship efforts.\n\nGoodness:  \nEvaluate the church's impact on local crime rates and addiction recovery.  \nMeasure ethical business practices among church members.  \nTrack instances of members standing up against injustice.\n\nFaithfulness:  \nAssess depth of biblical knowledge and application among members.  \nMeasure long-term commitment to missions and community service.  \nEvaluate integrity in personal and professional lives of members.\n\nGentleness:  \nMeasure the church's approach to disagreements and conflicts.  \nAssess the tone and content of social media engagement by members.  \nEvaluate the church's approach to discipline and correction.\n\nSelf-control:  \nAssess members' media consumption habits and their impact.  \nMeasure responsible financial practices among members.  \nEvaluate the church's use of resources and environmental impact.",

Quantification enables efficient decision-making that appears rigorous and objective. Metrics and A/B tests summarize vast amounts of data, providing comfort in what appears to be an ever more empirical picture of the user and their choices.  \nMetrics certainly make decision-making and product development more efficient, but just as you explored in the previous module, this efficiency can create, amplify, and mask harms.  \nAs an app or service starts up, it seems \u201cobvious\u201d that optimizing for core metrics is a good thing. It\u2019s exciting when daily active users go from 10 to 100 to 1,000. But as we optimize for metrics, we can lose sight of the original values the metrics were meant to support. When daily active users go from 1,000 to 1,000,000, it is increasingly difficult to know if users have an experience that aligns with our original intentions. That\u2019s especially true when new users live with very different conditions from our own. The bigger the system that\u2019s run on a handful of metrics, the easier it is to be out of touch with harms happening underneath:  \nGrowth in GDP might mean more addicted citizens  \nGrowth in patients treated might mean more sick people  \nGrowth in engagement might mean more anxious, distracted teenagers\n\nWhile metrics are useful for managing scale, their quantitative objectivity is often confused for ethical neutrality. In reality, metrics have deep impact on the behavior of social systems\u2014and not always in desirable ways:\n\n### Bible Reference(s)\n\nPaul's wrote optimistically for the Church in Corinth. \n\nMatthew 7:15-19 \u201cWatch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. 16 By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 17 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\n\nJames 1:27 ASV  \n27 Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.\n\n### Story \n\nSheila Gregoire, a passionate advocate for healthy Christian marriages, embarked on a groundbreaking journey that led to the writing of her book, \"The Great Sex Rescue.\" Sheila, a regular contributor to Focus on the Family, was deeply troubled after reading \"Love & Respect\" and seeing dozens of comments from women on their website decrying the book for enabling abuse in their marriages. Driven by her concern, Sheila sent a detailed letter along with a meta-analysis of the comments to Focus on the Family, encouraging them to respond to their own feedback and stop promoting the book. However, Focus on the Family ignored her plea, which inspired Sheila to embark on a comprehensive survey and project to uncover the truth.\n\nSheila conducted a survey of over 20,000 Christian women, delving into their marital and sexual satisfaction. Her findings were illuminating and sometimes startling, revealing that certain widely taught beliefs were significantly harming women's marital happiness and sexual satisfaction. For instance, the belief that a wife is obligated to have sex to prevent her husband from straying was linked to lower sexual and marital satisfaction. Armed with this data, Sheila wrote \"The Great Sex Rescue,\" where she not only presented her findings but also offered new frameworks for understanding and teaching about sex in marriage based on mutuality, respect, and true biblical principles.\n\nUpon publishing her book, Focus on the Family responded by scrubbing Sheila's name from their website and any comment that mentioned her name. Despite this, new Focus on the Family contributors Julie Slattery and Gary Thomas adopted nearly word-for-word the message denouncing the most harmful obligation sex-message without acknowledging Sheila\u2019s significant contribution. However, they continued to couch their findings in teachings that Sheila had exposed as harmful.\n\nThe story of Sheila Gregoire and her work aligns beautifully with the biblical wisdom of Matthew 7: \"By their fruit you shall know them.\" In a world obsessed with metrics like profit, engagement, and growth, Sheila did something truly remarkable by championing \"metrics that reduce known harm.\" Her focus on the actual well-being and satisfaction of women in marriages offers a powerful lesson in wisdom. Sheila\u2019s work shows how true wisdom lies in seeking and measuring the presence of the fruits of the Spirit, as listed in Galatians 5: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. By putting in the work to measure these spiritual fruits, just as Sheila did, we can truly reap a harvest that leads to flourishing lives. This proves that the true measure of any teaching is found in the presence of these fruits in our lives.\n\n### Discussion Question or Activity\n\nMetrics and Benchmarks\n\n\"If we truly believe that 'by their fruit you will recognize them' (Matthew 7:16), how might we reimagine our measures of success and growth in the church to reflect the Fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)? Consider both personal spiritual development and communal church life in your response.\"  \nThis elevated version:\n\nGrounds the question in scripture, reminding participants of the biblical basis for this approach.  \nDirectly references the Fruits of the Spirit, encouraging participants to consider each one (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control).  \nChallenges the notion of \"metrics\" by using the more holistic term \"measures of success and growth.\"  \nEncourages participants to think beyond just church attendance or giving, which are often default metrics.  \nPrompts consideration of both individual and community aspects of spiritual growth.  \nImplicitly questions current church practices without being confrontational.  \nInvites creative thinking about how abstract spiritual concepts might be practically observed or cultivated.\n\nThis reframed question should lead to a richer discussion about what truly matters in Christian life and how we might realign our focus and practices to nurture the Fruits of the Spirit in ourselves and our communities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTaking a humanely oriented, complex systems perspective requires us to be \u201cepistemically humble\u201d and to accept the inherent uncertainty of living in a world in which everything is subject to change:\n\nOptimizing the parts doesn't always lead to optimization of the whole, especially in complex systems. As David Stroh wrote in Systems Thinking for Social Change:\n\n\u201cIn order to optimize the performance of the entire system, people need to shift from trying to optimize their part of the system to improving relationships among its constituent parts.\u201d\n\nHere, the \u201cwhole\u201d is how a technology impacts the user and their wider community. The \u201cparts\u201d are individual elements of the technology such as specific algorithms, features, and metrics. Technology teams must move in and out, from parts to whole and whole to parts, so that they can grow in their understanding of the technology's effect on individual users and communities.\n\nThis process is often under-appreciated and under-resourced. Ask yourself where you could investigate these types of relationships. This may entail expanding your role to be more cross-functional, or hiring a new person to take on that role. These types of jobs are not common, often because their contributions are not conveniently captured by simple metrics.\n\nSo let us reimagine measures of success based on the Fruits of the Spirit:\n\nLove:  \nShift focus from attendance numbers to meaningful relationships formed.  \nMeasure the number of reconciliations facilitated within the church and community.  \nTrack instances of sacrificial giving and service to those in need.\n\nJoy:  \nAssess the church's impact on mental health in the community.  \nMeasure participation in community celebrations and cultural events.  \nSurvey members' sense of purpose and fulfillment in their faith journey.\n\nPeace:  \nTrack resolution of conflicts within the church and wider community.  \nMeasure reduction in domestic violence rates in the church community.  \nAssess the church's involvement in local peacemaking initiatives.\n\nPatience:  \nEvaluate long-term commitment to discipleship and spiritual growth programs.  \nMeasure retention and growth of new believers over time.  \nAssess willingness to engage in long-term community development projects.\n\nKindness:  \nTrack acts of unexpected generosity by church members.  \nMeasure the church's welcome and support of marginalized groups.  \nAssess the church's environmental stewardship efforts.\n\nGoodness:  \nEvaluate the church's impact on local crime rates and addiction recovery.  \nMeasure ethical business practices among church members.  \nTrack instances of members standing up against injustice.\n\nFaithfulness:  \nAssess depth of biblical knowledge and application among members.  \nMeasure long-term commitment to missions and community service.  \nEvaluate integrity in personal and professional lives of members.\n\nGentleness:  \nMeasure the church's approach to disagreements and conflicts.  \nAssess the tone and content of social media engagement by members.  \nEvaluate the church's approach to discipline and correction.\n\nSelf-control:  \nAssess members' media consumption habits and their impact.  \nMeasure responsible financial practices among members.  \nEvaluate the church's use of resources and environmental impact.\n\n### Application \n\nTo implement these measures, the church might:  \nDevelop a \"Fruit of the Spirit\" assessment tool for individual and communal reflection.  \nCreate small groups focused on cultivating specific fruits.  \nImplement a mentoring program pairing mature believers with newer ones.  \nRedesign church programs to intentionally foster these fruits.  \nPartner with local organizations to measure community impact.  \nUse technology to facilitate connection, accountability, and growth in these areas.\n\nThis approach would require a significant shift from typical suburban church metrics, focusing on qualitative growth and community impact rather than numbers and budgets. It would challenge members to live out their faith more intentionally and holistically, addressing the externalities of their lifestyles and consumption habits. The result could be a church that truly embodies the Fruits of the Spirit, making a tangible difference in individual lives and the broader community.\n\n### Class Homework\n\nCHT 5, Creating Shared Understanding\n\n### Other Media / Go Deeper / Class Maps\n\nMore than half of U.S. counties have no access or very limited access to local news \\- Medill \\- Northwestern University (Local Media has Collapsed)\n\nHow the Collapse of Local Newsrooms Made All Politics National \\- Columbia Journalism Review   \n"
