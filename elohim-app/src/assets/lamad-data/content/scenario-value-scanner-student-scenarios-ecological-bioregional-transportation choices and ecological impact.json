  "content": "Scenario: Transportation choices and ecological impact\n    Given Kenji walks most places due to lack of car\n    And walking has minimal ecological impact\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks transportation\n    Then it should recognize walking as ecological care contribution\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for low-impact transportation\n    And it should show \"Walking instead of driving prevented X carbon emissions\"\n    And it should validate that poverty can align with ecological values\n    And the system should recognize low-impact mobility as care work\n    And Kenji should see his car-free life as ecological stewardship\n",
