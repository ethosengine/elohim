Community Layer Value Recognition for Senior\n  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want my community contributions to be recognized and my experience to inform governance\n  So that seniors are valued as productive community members building care economy infrastructure\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the senior user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret volunteers 10 hours/week in community organizations\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates community care economy\n    And Margaret has decades of community involvement and knowledge\n\n  Scenario: Community volunteering contributions quantified and recognized\n    Given Margaret volunteers 10 hours/week across community organizations\n    And this represents ~500 hours/year of community labor\n    When the community_elohim tracks volunteer contributions\n    Then all volunteer hours should be quantified and valued\n    And the economic value of her labor should be calculated\n    And community care tokens should accumulate to reflect contributions\n    And Margaret's productivity should be visible despite retirement status\n    And the narrative that retirees \"don't work\" should be countered\n    And her community standing should reflect her contributions\n\n  Scenario: Senior experience and knowledge informs community governance\n    Given Margaret has decades of community involvement\n    And she understands local history, patterns, and relationships\n    When community decisions are being made\n    Then Margaret's knowledge should be actively solicited\n    And her voice should carry weight in governance processes\n    And senior wisdom should inform community planning\n    And decades of experience should be treated as valuable resource\n    And community governance should benefit from long-term perspective\n    And Margaret should have legitimate authority in civic decisions\n\n  Scenario: Building care economy infrastructure at community scale\n    Given Margaret has time and motivation to build new systems\n    And care economy requires infrastructure development\n    When the community_elohim coordinates care economy building\n    Then Margaret should be identified as potential infrastructure builder\n    And her generation could establish care economy as normal practice\n    And seniors could be powerful advocates and practitioners\n    And community care economy infrastructure should be senior-led\n    And Margaret's cohort could transform how community operates\n    And systemic change should be enabled through senior participation\n\n  Scenario: Food bank volunteering with dignity for participants\n    Given Margaret volunteers at community food bank\n    And she also uses food bank resources on her limited budget\n    When the community_elohim coordinates food access\n    Then Margaret should both contribute and receive without stigma\n    And the framing should be community resource sharing, not charity\n    And her volunteer labor should give her standing as member, not supplicant\n    And she should experience dignity in both giving and receiving\n    And community food access should operate on mutual aid principles\n    And Margaret should be valued contributor regardless of income\n\n  Scenario: Mentoring younger community members and leaders\n    Given Margaret has professional experience and life wisdom\n    And younger adults benefit from mentoring\n    When the community_elohim facilitates mentoring connections\n    Then Margaret should be connected to mentees\n    And her knowledge should be passed to next generation\n    And the mentoring labor should be tracked as care contribution\n    And intergenerational knowledge transmission should be valued\n    And Margaret's experience should serve community capacity-building\n    And younger leaders should benefit from senior guidance\n\n  Scenario: Community board and committee participation\n    Given Margaret has time to attend meetings and do board work\n    And community organizations need committed board members\n    When Margaret participates in community governance\n    Then her board service should be tracked as significant labor\n    And the time, preparation, and decision-making should be quantified\n    And community leadership contributions should be visible\n    And Margaret's governance participation should be valued\n    And seniors should be recognized as having capacity for leadership\n    And her contributions should build community governance systems\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating community resource sharing and mutual aid\n    Given Margaret has organizational skills and available time\n    And community needs coordination of sharing networks\n    When the community_elohim facilitates resource coordination\n    Then Margaret should be identified as potential coordinator\n    And her labor in coordinating should be recognized and valued\n    And community resource sharing should reduce individual scarcity\n    And Margaret's organizational contributions should strengthen community\n    And her time availability should serve collective benefit\n    And coordination labor should be visible and appreciated\n\n  Scenario: Senior-to-senior support and community building\n    Given Margaret is in \"younger\" senior cohort (65-74)\n    And older seniors (75+) need support and connection\n    When the community_elohim coordinates senior support\n    Then Margaret should be part of senior mutual aid networks\n    And her peer support should be recognized as care contribution\n    And senior-to-senior care should prevent isolation\n    And age-matched support should be valued alongside intergenerational\n    And senior community should be strengthened through care economy\n    And Margaret should build relationships with peers\n\n  Scenario: Community advocacy for senior issues and care economy\n    Given Margaret understands both care economy and senior needs\n    And community policy affects senior quality of life\n    When the community_elohim supports advocacy efforts\n    Then Margaret should be connected to senior advocacy\n    And her voice should inform policy on retirement, care, and aging\n    And care economy principles should be advanced through advocacy\n    And seniors should organize for systemic change\n    And Margaret's generation could reshape retirement policy\n    And political power should be built through care economy visibility\n\n  Scenario: Community food systems and nutrition access for seniors\n    Given Margaret manages nutrition on limited budget\n    And community food systems affect senior health\n    When the community_elohim coordinates food access\n    Then Margaret should help shape senior-appropriate food programs\n    And her needs and knowledge should inform program design\n    And community should ensure affordable nutritious food for seniors\n    And Margaret should influence resource allocation\n    And senior nutritional needs should be community priority\n    And her participation should improve services for all seniors\n\n  Scenario: Cultural and artistic contributions to community life\n    Given Margaret has time for cultural and creative pursuits\n    And community cultural life requires participation\n    When Margaret engages in community cultural activities\n    Then her participation and leadership should be tracked\n    And cultural contributions should be recognized as care work\n    And community flourishing includes cultural richness\n    And Margaret's creative labor should be valued\n    And seniors should be visible in community cultural life\n    And arts and culture should be part of care economy\n\n  Scenario: Making aggregate senior contributions visible at community scale\n    Given thousands of seniors make similar contributions\n    And their collective labor is massive but invisible\n    When the community_elohim aggregates senior care contributions\n    Then the community should see total senior care economy value\n    And data should show seniors as highly productive population\n    And cultural narratives about retirement should be challenged\n    And policy should reflect actual senior contributions\n    And community should recognize dependence on senior labor\n    And visibility could transform attitudes about aging and retirement\n",
