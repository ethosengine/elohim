  "content": "Scenario: Neighborhood awareness of caregiver situation and needs\n    Given many neighbors may not know about James's caregiving burden\n    And invisibility prevents neighbors from offering support\n    When the neighborhood_elohim shares appropriate information\n    Then neighbors should be aware James is providing intensive care\n    And they should understand his situation without violating privacy\n    And awareness should enable neighbors to offer help meaningfully\n    And James should not be invisible in his own neighborhood\n    And caregiver situation should be visible enough to enable support\n",
