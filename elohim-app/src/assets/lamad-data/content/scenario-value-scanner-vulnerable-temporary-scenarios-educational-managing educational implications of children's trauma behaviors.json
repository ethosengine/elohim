  "content": "Scenario: Managing educational implications of children's trauma behaviors\n    Given my children's trauma manifests in school behaviors (acting out, withdrawal, academic struggles)\n    And school may not understand trauma-informed responses\n    When children's trauma affects their school experience\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me advocate for trauma-informed school responses\n    And provides information on trauma's educational impacts\n    And helps schools understand children's behaviors as trauma responses, not \"bad\" behavior\n    And coordinates with school mental health support\n    And tracks children's behavioral patterns and triggers\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to concerning school incidents\n    And recognizes trauma advocacy as sophisticated parenting labor\n    And validates that trauma-informed education protects children\n",
