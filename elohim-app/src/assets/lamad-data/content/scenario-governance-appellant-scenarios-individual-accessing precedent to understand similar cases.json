  "content": "Scenario: Accessing precedent to understand similar cases\n    Given I am considering filing an appeal\n    And I want to understand how similar cases were decided\n    When I search the precedent database for \"mental health intervention + privacy\"\n    Then I can see anonymized cases with constitutional reasoning\n    And I can view outcomes and protocol changes that resulted\n    And I can see success rates for different appeal types\n    And I can understand the constitutional framework being applied\n    And This helps me calibrate my expectations and build my appeal argument\n",
