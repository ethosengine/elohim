Municipality Layer Value Recognition for Senior\n  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the municipality governance layer\n  I want to access appropriate services and influence municipal policy\n  So that municipal systems support senior flourishing and recognize senior contributions\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the senior user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret participates in municipal civic life\n    And the municipality governance context is active\n    And the municipality_elohim coordinates municipal care economy\n    And Margaret lives within the municipal jurisdiction\n\n  Scenario: Access to senior nutrition programs without stigma\n    Given Margaret manages nutrition on $32k/year fixed income\n    And municipal senior nutrition programs exist\n    When the municipality_elohim connects Margaret to food resources\n    Then she should be informed about senior meal programs\n    And Meals on Wheels or congregate dining should be accessible\n    And the framing should be senior service, not poverty relief\n    And Margaret should access programs with dignity\n    And her care contributions should be visible to counterbalance receiving\n    And municipal food resources should support senior health\n\n  Scenario: Municipal senior center programs that recognize continued productivity\n    Given Margaret is active and engaged, not waiting to die\n    And senior centers sometimes reinforce obsolescence narratives\n    When the municipality_elohim connects Margaret to senior programs\n    Then programs should treat seniors as productive contributors\n    And opportunities should include volunteering, teaching, organizing\n    And the focus should be engagement and contribution, not entertainment\n    And Margaret should find programs that honor her capability\n    And senior centers should be care economy hubs\n    And municipal programs should support active aging\n\n  Scenario: Public transportation access supports senior independence\n    Given Margaret can no longer afford car ownership\n    And she needs transportation for medical appointments, shopping, and social life\n    When the municipality_elohim provides transportation information\n    Then accessible public transit should be available\n    And senior fare programs should be communicated clearly\n    And transportation should enable Margaret's continued independence\n    And mobility should be supported as key to aging in community\n    And municipal transit should be optimized for senior access\n    And affordable transportation should preserve autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Municipal food assistance programs accessed with dignity\n    Given Margaret's budget is tight at $150/week\n    And municipal SNAP or food assistance may be available\n    When the municipality_elohim identifies assistance eligibility\n    Then Margaret should be informed without stigma\n    And enrollment should be simple and dignified\n    And her care contributions should be visible alongside receiving benefits\n    And the framing should be community resource access\n    And participation should feel like claiming entitlement, not begging\n    And municipal assistance should support fixed-income seniors\n\n  Scenario: Influencing municipal policy on senior services and care economy\n    Given Margaret has lived experience of retirement and care economy\n    And municipal policy affects senior quality of life\n    When the municipality_elohim facilitates policy engagement\n    Then Margaret should be connected to policy-making processes\n    And her voice should inform municipal senior services\n    And care economy principles should be brought to municipal governance\n    And seniors should organize to shape policy\n    And Margaret's contributions should give her authority in policy discussions\n    And municipal planning should reflect senior input\n\n  Scenario: Municipal health care access and coordination\n    Given Margaret has changing health needs with aging\n    And she navigates complex health care systems\n    When the municipality_elohim coordinates health access\n    Then municipal health programs should be accessible\n    And senior health clinics should be available and affordable\n    And navigation support should help Margaret access care\n    And preventive health should be prioritized for seniors\n    And municipal health policy should support senior wellness\n    And Margaret should be able to age healthily in community\n\n  Scenario: Property tax relief and housing support for fixed-income seniors\n    Given Margaret lives on fixed income\n    And property taxes or rent can threaten housing stability\n    When the municipality_elohim identifies housing assistance\n    Then senior property tax relief programs should be communicated\n    And rental assistance should be accessible if applicable\n    And Margaret should be able to age in place affordably\n    And housing stability should be protected for seniors\n    And municipal housing policy should recognize fixed-income constraints\n    And aging in community should be economically feasible\n\n  Scenario: Senior employment and income supplementation programs\n    Given Margaret's fixed income is limited\n    And some seniors want/need supplemental income\n    When the municipality_elohim provides employment information\n    Then senior-appropriate employment opportunities should be available\n    And part-time work that doesn't jeopardize benefits should be possible\n    And income supplementation programs should be accessible\n    And Margaret should have options to increase resources if she chooses\n    And employment should be optional, not mandatory for survival\n    And municipal programs should support senior economic security\n\n  Scenario: Municipal recognition of senior volunteer contributions\n    Given Margaret volunteers extensively in municipal programs\n    And her labor subsidizes municipal service provision\n    When the municipality_elohim tracks volunteer contributions\n    Then municipal government should see aggregate senior volunteer value\n    And policy should reflect dependence on senior volunteer labor\n    And seniors should be recognized as essential to municipal function\n    And Margaret's contributions should give her standing in municipal affairs\n    And volunteer labor should inform resource allocation\n    And senior productivity should be visible to government\n\n  Scenario: Emergency preparedness includes senior needs and capabilities\n    Given Margaret has nursing background and crisis response experience\n    And seniors have specific vulnerabilities in emergencies\n    When the municipality_elohim coordinates emergency planning\n    Then Margaret should be part of emergency response networks\n    And her skills should be known to emergency management\n    And senior vulnerabilities should be planned for\n    And senior capabilities should be mobilized in crisis\n    And municipal preparedness should include and empower seniors\n    And Margaret should contribute to community resilience\n\n  Scenario: Municipal parks and recreation optimized for senior use\n    Given Margaret needs physical activity for health\n    And public spaces should serve all ages\n    When the municipality_elohim provides recreation information\n    Then parks should have senior-appropriate amenities\n    And walking paths, benches, and accessibility should be prioritized\n    And recreation programs should include senior activities\n    And public space should support active aging\n    And municipal planning should consider senior needs\n    And Margaret should have access to health-supporting public resources\n\n  Scenario: Protecting seniors from municipal surveillance while enabling services\n    Given Margaret participates in municipal programs\n    And municipal systems collect data\n    When the municipality_elohim manages Margaret's municipal data\n    Then her privacy must be protected from surveillance\n    And service access should not require surrendering privacy\n    And data collection should be minimal and purposeful\n    And Margaret should control what municipal government knows\n    And elder surveillance should be prevented\n    And dignity should be preserved in all municipal interactions\n",
