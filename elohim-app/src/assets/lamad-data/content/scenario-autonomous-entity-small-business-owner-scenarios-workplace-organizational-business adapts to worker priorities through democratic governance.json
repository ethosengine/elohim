  "content": "Scenario: Business adapts to worker priorities through democratic governance\n    Given Rosa's priorities as owner shaped business direction\n    And workers' priorities may differ in important ways\n    When workers gain governance voice during transition\n    Then schedule flexibility increases based on workers' family needs\n    And service offerings adapt to worker expertise and interests\n    And workplace improvements workers suggested previously get implemented\n    And compensation equity is addressed through democratic value distribution\n    And business becomes genuinely responsive to worker flourishing, not just profit\n",
