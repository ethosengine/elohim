  "content": "Scenario: After-school programs for Keisha accessed through care tokens\n    Given Marcus's sister Keisha needs care while Marcus shops\n    And after-school programs exist in the community\n    When care coordination needs are identified\n    Then Marcus's family should access programs through care token economy\n    And his care contributions should subsidize Keisha's program costs\n    And care economy should coordinate care needs across community\n    And Marcus's burden should be reduced through community support\n    And reciprocity should frame the exchange, not charity\n    And community care should support his family's flourishing\n",
