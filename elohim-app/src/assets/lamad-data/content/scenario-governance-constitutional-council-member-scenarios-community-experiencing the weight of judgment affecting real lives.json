  "content": "Scenario: Experiencing the weight of judgment affecting real lives\n    Given my decision will affect Marcus's mental health support\n    And I cannot hide behind procedure or defer to experts\n    When I must judge knowing uncertainty and consequences\n    Then I feel: the burden of democratic responsibility\n    And I grapple: with possibility I might be wrong\n    And I draw on: my experience as nurse who has seen suffering\n    And I consider: my role as mother navigating care and autonomy\n    And I accept: that I must judge despite uncertainty\n    And I am supported: through compensation, training, and respect\n    And I learn: what democratic participation means at deepest level\n",
