Household Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver\n  As a caregiver managing household for dependent adults\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want household governance that recognizes care complexity and reduced capacity\n  So that household functions sustainably despite intensive care demands\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the caregiver user \"James\" is registered in the system\n    And James shares household with David who has early-onset Alzheimer's\n    And David's capability is progressively declining\n    And James manages household governance for both of them\n    And household income is severely reduced (~$40k/year from part-time work)\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And the household_elohim coordinates household care economy\n    And James is simultaneously caregiver and household manager\n\n  Scenario: Household governance transitions as care recipient loses capacity\n    Given David participated in household decisions before diagnosis\n    And his decision-making capability is now declining\n    When the household_elohim tracks governance participation\n    Then it should recognize David's changing capacity sensitively\n    And it should adjust his governance role appropriately\n    And it should preserve David's dignity despite declining capability\n    And it should support James in taking on decisions David once made\n    And governance transition should be respectful and gradual\n    And David should maintain maximum autonomy possible\n\n  Scenario: Household budget management on severely reduced income\n    Given household income dropped from $80k to ~$40k/year\n    And medical expenses have increased significantly\n    And caregiving prevents James from full-time employment\n    When James manages household finances\n    Then the household_elohim should track constrained budget carefully\n    And it should help prioritize essential expenses\n    And it should identify financial assistance resources\n    And it should recognize economic strain as care-related\n    And household should access care economy support based on need\n    And financial precarity should be addressed systematically\n\n  Scenario: Household care labor made visible despite reduced monetary income\n    Given James's care work is worth $50k+/year professionally\n    And household monetary income is only $40k/year\n    When household economics are evaluated\n    Then the household_elohim should show total household value\n    And James's care labor should be valued alongside income\n    And household should be recognized as generating $90k+ total value\n    And care work should count as household economic contribution\n    And reduced monetary income should not mean reduced household value\n\n  Scenario: Household food planning for specialized care needs\n    Given David requires special nutrition for Alzheimer's care\n    And James must manage David's changing appetite and needs\n    And household food budget is constrained\n    When James plans household meals\n    Then the household_elohim should support specialized meal planning\n    And it should track David's nutritional requirements\n    And it should help James meet care needs within budget\n    And it should ensure James's own nutrition isn't neglected\n    And household food planning should serve both members\n\n  Scenario: Household safety modifications as care needs increase\n    Given David requires increasing safety monitoring\n    And household needs modifications for safe caregiving\n    When household safety is assessed\n    Then the household_elohim should identify needed modifications\n    And it should connect James to resources for safety equipment\n    And it should help finance modifications through care economy\n    And household should be adaptable to progressive care needs\n    And safety should be maintained as capability declines\n\n  Scenario: Household schedule coordination around intensive care demands\n    Given David requires constant supervision and care\n    And James must balance caregiving with part-time work\n    When household schedules are coordinated\n    Then the household_elohim should integrate care demands with work\n    And it should identify conflicts between care and employment\n    And it should help James negotiate sustainable scheduling\n    And household operations should be possible despite constraints\n    And schedule coordination should prevent impossible demands\n\n  Scenario: Household resource allocation prioritizes care sustainability\n    Given household resources are severely limited\n    And care needs are high and increasing\n    When household resources are allocated\n    Then the household_elohim should prioritize care sustainability\n    And it should ensure James has resources for respite\n    And it should allocate funds for both David's and James's needs\n    And resource decisions should prevent caregiver burnout\n    And household economics should serve sustainable caregiving\n\n  Scenario: Household privacy protected amid care intimacy\n    Given James provides intimate personal care for David\n    And household care generates extremely private data\n    When household care is documented\n    Then privacy must be absolutely protected\n    And David's dignity must be preserved in all data\n    And intimate care details should never be exposed\n    And household data should remain under James's control\n    And privacy protection should be comprehensive and inviolable\n\n  Scenario: Household emergency preparedness for care crisis\n    Given David's condition could deteriorate suddenly\n    And James could become ill and unable to provide care\n    When the household_elohim plans for emergencies\n    Then it should maintain emergency care plans\n    And it should identify backup caregivers\n    And it should ensure emergency contacts are current\n    And it should prepare for crisis scenarios\n    And household should have resilience planning for care emergencies\n\n  Scenario: Household technology adapted for caregiving support\n    Given James uses technology for care coordination\n    And household needs assistive technology for David\n    When household technology is configured\n    Then the household_elohim should support care technology integration\n    And it should help James use monitoring and safety technology\n    And it should ensure technology serves caregiving needs\n    And assistive devices should be coordinated through household system\n    And technology should reduce burden, not increase complexity\n\n  Scenario: Household care economy supplements for financial strain\n    Given household income is severely reduced by caregiving\n    And care expenses are high and increasing\n    When household economic status is assessed\n    Then care token supplements should be available\n    And household should receive care economy financial support\n    And access should be dignified and non-stigmatizing\n    And care economy should function as household safety net\n    And financial support should recognize caregiving economic impact\n\n  Scenario: Household maintenance sustained despite overwhelming care demands\n    Given James is overwhelmed with caregiving responsibilities\n    And routine household maintenance is difficult to maintain\n    When household maintenance needs arise\n    Then the household_elohim should connect to community support\n    And neighbors should be able to assist with household tasks\n    And care economy should enable mutual aid for household maintenance\n    And James should access help without depleting limited finances\n    And household should remain functional despite care intensity\n",
