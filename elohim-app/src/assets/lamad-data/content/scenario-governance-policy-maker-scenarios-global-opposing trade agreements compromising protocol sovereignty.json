  "content": "Scenario: Opposing trade agreements compromising protocol sovereignty\n    Given trade negotiations may include digital governance provisions\n    And some proposals would restrict community autonomy\n    When I evaluate trade agreement implications\n    Then I identify: provisions threatening protocol sovereignty\n    And I oppose: requirements mandating centralization or backdoors\n    And I insist: on preserving community choice\n    And I coalition: with other nations defending autonomy\n    And I use: evidence showing protocol benefits economic wellbeing\n    And I resist: regulatory arbitrage through trade agreements\n    And I protect: democratic governance from corporate capture via trade\n",
