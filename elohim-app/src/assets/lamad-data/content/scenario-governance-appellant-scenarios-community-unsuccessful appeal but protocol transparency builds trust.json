  "content": "Scenario: Unsuccessful appeal but protocol transparency builds trust\n    Given my appeal was reviewed and the agent's decision was affirmed\n    And I didn't get the outcome I wanted\n    When I receive the Constitutional Council's detailed reasoning\n    Then I can see that my appeal was genuinely considered not dismissed\n    And I understand the constitutional principles that were applied\n    And I see how my case compares to similar precedents\n    And I know I had meaningful recourse even though I didn't prevail\n    And The transparency helps me trust the process even in defeat\n    And Trust in community governance is maintained through honest engagement\n",
