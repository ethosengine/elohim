  "content": "Scenario: Preregistration of hypotheses to prevent cherry-picking results\n    Given I want my research to be scientifically credible\n    And I know publication bias favors positive findings\n    When I design my regional study\n    Then I preregister: hypotheses before seeing the data\n    And I commit: to reporting all results not just flattering ones\n    And I plan: analysis methods in advance to prevent p-hacking\n    And I document: any deviations from preregistered plan with justification\n    And I publish: null results and failures alongside successes\n    And My methodological rigor maintains: scientific integrity over advocacy\n    And Credibility comes from: honesty about what works and what doesn't\n",
