Education Governance for Board Member\n  As a school board member in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the educational functional layer\n  I want independent analysis of education policies and student outcomes\n  So that I can make informed decisions serving all students equitably despite lacking education expertise\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the board_member user is registered in the system\n    And the educational governance context is active\n    And I am a volunteer school board member working full-time elsewhere\n\n  Scenario: Board member evaluates superintendent recommendation to close schools\n    Given superintendent recommends closing three schools for efficiency\n    And 200-page closure analysis emphasizes cost savings and facility utilization\n    And affected communities organized opposition but lack data to counter staff analysis\n    When the board member requests Observer independent analysis\n    Then they receive impact assessment showing commute time increases for affected families\n    And see enrollment data contradicting claims of declining student numbers\n    And access demographic analysis showing closures disproportionately affect low-income students\n    And get comparison of how peer districts addressed facility challenges without closure\n    And independent analysis reveals information staff presentation minimized\n\n  Scenario: Board member learns accessible expertise on special education compliance\n    Given district faces federal monitoring for special education compliance issues\n    And board must oversee corrective action plan with complex legal requirements\n    And board member has no special education or legal background\n    When the board member uses Observer to understand the situation\n    Then they receive plain-language explanation of IDEA requirements and violations\n    And see comparison of district's special education outcomes to state averages\n    And access key questions to ask superintendent about implementation capacity\n    And get examples of how other districts achieved compliance\n    And accessible expertise enables informed oversight without full-time study\n\n  Scenario: Board member tracks implementation of equity-focused discipline policy\n    Given board adopted restorative justice policy to reduce suspensions two years ago\n    And superintendent reported successful implementation at board meetings\n    And community members report ongoing disparate discipline of students of color\n    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking\n    Then they see suspension rates by school, race, and disability status over time\n    And discover overall suspensions declined but disparities remained or widened\n    And find some schools implemented restorative practices while others didn't\n    And access teacher training data showing incomplete implementation\n    And impact tracking reveals gap between board policy and actual outcomes\n\n  Scenario: Board member evaluates achievement gap despite test score improvements\n    Given superintendent presents improving test scores as evidence of success\n    And board wants to understand if all students are benefiting from improvements\n    And media reports question equity of district's progress\n    When the board member uses Observer educational equity analysis\n    Then they receive achievement data disaggregated by race, income, and language\n    And see average scores improved but gaps between groups widened\n    And access analysis showing advanced course access concentrated in affluent schools\n    And discover resource distribution favoring already-high-performing schools\n    And equity analysis reveals which students are and aren't being served well\n\n  Scenario: Board member understands community priorities on curriculum controversy\n    Given board faces decision on proposed curriculum adoption\n    And board meetings dominated by organized groups advocating strong positions\n    And board wants to understand broader parent and educator perspectives\n    When the board member seeks community accountability data from Observer\n    Then they receive survey data from representative sample of district families\n    And see teacher professional judgment on curriculum separate from union position\n    And access student learning outcome data from districts using proposed curriculum\n    And understand concerns of diverse communities beyond organized advocacy\n    And community accountability helps board make decision aligned with broader interests\n\n  Scenario: Board member detects potential conflict of interest in vendor contract\n    Given district staff recommends multi-million dollar contract with education technology vendor\n    And superintendent emphasizes vendor's qualifications and student benefit claims\n    And board will vote on contract at next meeting\n    When the board member uses Observer capture protection analysis\n    Then they discover vendor hired former district administrator as consultant\n    And see vendor's student outcome claims not supported by independent research\n    And find contract terms more favorable to vendor than peer district contracts\n    And access alternative vendors with better evidence and more standard terms\n    And capture protection makes relationships and manipulation tactics visible\n\n  Scenario: Board member evaluates budget allocating resources across schools\n    Given superintendent proposes budget with significant changes to school staffing\n    And budget presentation emphasizes district-wide efficiency and priorities\n    And board wants to understand impacts on different schools and student populations\n    When the board member requests Observer resource equity analysis\n    Then they receive per-pupil spending comparison across all district schools\n    And see staffing changes impact by school demographics and current performance\n    And access analysis of which students gain versus lose resources under proposal\n    And discover budget concentrates cuts in already-struggling schools\n    And equity analysis reveals disparate impacts staff presentation minimized\n\n  Scenario: Board member prepares for teacher contract negotiation\n    Given board must negotiate collective bargaining agreement with teachers union\n    And superintendent provides analysis emphasizing district's budget constraints\n    And board wants to balance fiscal responsibility with teacher retention and quality\n    When the board member uses Observer labor relations context\n    Then they receive comparison of district's teacher compensation to regional market\n    And see teacher turnover and vacancy data by school showing retention challenges\n    And access analysis of contract proposals' impact on recruitment and budget\n    And get examples of creative solutions from peer district negotiations\n    And accessible expertise helps board negotiate effectively\n\n  Scenario: Board member evaluates superintendent performance with outcome data\n    Given board conducts annual superintendent evaluation\n    And superintendent's self-evaluation emphasizes accomplishments and progress\n    And board wants objective assessment of district performance during tenure\n    When the board member uses Observer accountability tracking\n    Then they receive longitudinal data on student outcomes since superintendent started\n    And see progress on board priorities and strategic plan goals\n    And access comparison of district performance trajectory to similar districts\n    And discover some promised improvements didn't materialize or regressed\n    And objective data helps board evaluate performance beyond self-reporting\n",
