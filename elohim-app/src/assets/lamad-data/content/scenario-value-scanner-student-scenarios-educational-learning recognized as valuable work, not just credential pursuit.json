  "content": "Scenario: Learning recognized as valuable work, not just credential pursuit\n    Given Kenji spends 40+ hours per week on academic work\n    And traditional economics treats student labor as non-productive\n    When the educational_elohim tracks Kenji's educational work\n    Then it should recognize studying as labor that creates value\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for learning work\n    And it should validate \"You invested 45 hours in learning this week\"\n    And student intellectual labor should be valued, not invisible\n    And the system should recognize education as work toward capability development\n    And learning should be understood as care economy investment\n",
