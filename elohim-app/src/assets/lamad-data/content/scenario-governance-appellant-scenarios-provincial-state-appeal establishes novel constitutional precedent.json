  "content": "Scenario: Appeal establishes novel constitutional precedent\n    Given my case involves a situation not previously addressed\n    And existing precedents don't clearly apply to my circumstances\n    When Regional Constitutional Council deliberates my case\n    Then they engage deeply with constitutional principles\n    And They consider multiple interpretations and their implications\n    And They consult technical experts about what's technically possible\n    And They examine similar cases from other regions for comparison\n    And They create new precedent with careful reasoning\n    And The precedent becomes part of public constitutional record\n    And Future similar cases reference my appeal's constitutional interpretation\n",
