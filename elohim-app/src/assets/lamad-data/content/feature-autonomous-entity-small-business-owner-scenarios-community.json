Community Institution Building for Small Business Owner\n  As a small_business_owner in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want my business to become genuine community institution\n  So that neighborhood embeddedness is preserved and deepened beyond individual ownership\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Rosa's Auto Repair has served the neighborhood for 15 years\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And EAE conversion enables institutionalizing community stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Business legacy transforms from individual ownership to community institution\n    Given Rosa built more than business\u2014she created community institution\n    And neighbors trust her shop because they trust her personally\n    When conversion to democratic ownership formalizes community commitment\n    Then Rosa's 15 years of community stewardship is honored and documented\n    And sponsorships (youth soccer, school fundraisers) continue under democratic governance\n    And informal credit for struggling families becomes formalized support program\n    And community institution is preserved beyond Rosa's personal involvement\n    And legacy becomes \"founder who chose community over individual wealth\"\n\n  Scenario: Customer trust relationships institutionalize through democratic governance\n    Given customers bring cars to Rosa because of 15 years of personal trust\n    And trust was built through honest work, fair pricing, and community care\n    When ownership transitions from individual to democratic\n    Then customer histories are documented (with privacy protection)\n    And workers inherit trust relationships through Rosa's introduction\n    And customers learn their support now benefits worker-owners, not distant capital\n    And democratic governance creates transparency deepening trust\n    And community_elohim ensures trust institutionalizes beyond individual owner\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood economic circulation increases through distributed ownership\n    Given Rosa's profit ($40K annually) left the neighborhood for her personal use\n    And value extraction limited community benefit despite Rosa's generosity\n    When democratic ownership distributes value throughout community\n    Then worker wage increases ($14 \u2192 $18/hour) circulate in neighborhood economy\n    And community programs receive dedicated funding from value circulation\n    And workers spend locally, supporting other neighborhood businesses\n    And multiplier effects amplify as spending cascades through community\n    And community_elohim documents wealth circulation vs. previous extraction\n\n  Scenario: Community members invest in preserving neighborhood institution\n    Given neighbors value Rosa's Auto but have no ownership pathway\n    And community members want to support local businesses beyond patronage\n    When community investment pool enables neighborhood participation\n    Then neighbors invest modest amounts ($2K-$10K) in acquisition financing\n    And investors receive fair return (5% annually) plus social benefit\n    And investment enables Rosa's dignified exit while protecting workers\n    And community gains democratic governance voice in institution they supported\n    And community_elohim manages investment relationships transparently\n\n  Scenario: Business space becomes community gathering place beyond commercial function\n    Given auto repair shop could serve community beyond car service\n    And neighborhood lacks gathering spaces for organizing and connection\n    When democratic governance considers community space usage\n    Then workers offer shop space for community meetings after business hours\n    And neighborhood organizing groups can use facilities for free\n    And youth apprenticeship programs connect young people to skilled trades\n    And community bulletin board shares neighborhood information and mutual aid\n    And business becomes community hub, not just commercial enterprise\n\n  Scenario: Local supply relationships strengthen through democratic coordination\n    Given Rosa bought some supplies from neighborhood vendors\n    And democratic network can deepen local sourcing commitments\n    When workplace and community governance prioritize local procurement\n    Then auto shop sources more supplies from neighborhood businesses\n    And EAE network coordination provides volume purchasing to local vendors\n    And supplier relationships become mutual support, not just transactions\n    And supply chain transparency shows community members how money circulates locally\n    And community_elohim coordinates supply chain for maximum local benefit\n\n  Scenario: Community accountability mechanisms ensure democratic governance serves neighborhood\n    Given business operates in and depends on community\n    And community has legitimate interest in business practices and impacts\n    When community governance structures enable neighborhood voice\n    Then community stakeholder meetings provide input on business direction\n    And neighbors can raise concerns about environmental impacts or labor practices\n    And workers consider community feedback in democratic decision-making\n    And accountability is transparent and bidirectional (community and workers both accountable)\n    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation while protecting worker autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood youth gain apprenticeship and ownership pathways\n    Given community lacks skilled trades training and economic opportunity for youth\n    And Rosa's expertise could benefit next generation but individual ownership prevents scaling\n    When democratic governance creates youth apprenticeship program\n    Then neighborhood youth learn auto repair skills with paid training\n    And apprentices can become worker-owners after demonstrating competency\n    And economic opportunity stays in community, not extracting to corporate chains\n    And intergenerational knowledge transfer strengthens community resilience\n    And community_elohim documents youth pathways from apprenticeship to ownership\n\n  Scenario: Community resilience increases through democratic business network\n    Given isolated businesses are vulnerable to economic shocks\n    And community resilience depends on interconnected mutual support\n    When Rosa's Auto joins EAE network of democratic community businesses\n    Then business survives economic downturns through network mutual aid\n    And workers coordinate with other democratic enterprises for mutual benefit\n    And community institutions support each other rather than competing\n    And economic shocks are absorbed collectively, not destroying individual businesses\n    And community_elohim coordinates resilience strategies across democratic network\n\n  Scenario: Former owner's community standing shifts from business owner to honored elder\n    Given Rosa was known as \"business owner\" for 15 years\n    And her community identity was tied to entrepreneurial success\n    When ownership transitions to workers\n    Then Rosa's community standing becomes \"founder of democratic institution\"\n    And neighbors honor her choice to prioritize community over maximum profit\n    And her wisdom is sought as elder who facilitated transformation\n    And community respects her continued participation as resident, not owner\n    And community_elohim documents her transition as model for other small business owners\n\n  Scenario: Environmental stewardship practices improve through community accountability\n    Given individual ownership limited environmental investment\n    And community bears environmental impacts of business operations\n    When democratic governance with community input prioritizes sustainability\n    Then auto shop invests in proper waste disposal and recycling\n    And hazardous materials (oil, antifreeze, batteries) are handled responsibly\n    And workers implement environmental improvements community values\n    And transparency about environmental practices builds community trust\n    And community_elohim documents environmental stewardship for neighborhood benefit\n\n  Scenario: Community celebrates successful transition as demonstration model\n    Given neighborhood watched Rosa's difficult decision and graceful transition\n    And other small business owners face similar ownership burden challenges\n    When transition proves successful for all stakeholders\n    Then community honors Rosa at public celebration of democratic conversion\n    And her story becomes model encouraging other small business owners to consider conversion\n    And neighborhood gains confidence in democratic ownership as viable alternative\n    And successful transition demonstrates community can support democratic economy\n    And community_elohim shares transition story to inspire broader movement\n",
