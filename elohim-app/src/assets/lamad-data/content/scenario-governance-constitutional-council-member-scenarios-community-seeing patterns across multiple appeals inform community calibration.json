  "content": "Scenario: Seeing patterns across multiple appeals inform community calibration\n    Given our council has reviewed 50 appeals over two months\n    And I notice recurring themes and tensions\n    When I observe patterns in appeal types and outcomes\n    Then I see: many adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging\n    And I notice: three business loan denials with similar criteria\n    And I identify: recurring privacy threshold concerns\n    And I share: these observations with community leader\n    And community can: consider local protocol calibration\n    And my service: informs democratic governance beyond individual cases\n    And patterns reveal: community-wide issues requiring deliberation\n",
