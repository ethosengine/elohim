  "content": "Scenario: Addressing existential AI risk through democratic governance\n    Given superintelligent AI poses existential threat\n    And democratic oversight might mitigate this risk\n    When I participate in global existential risk discussions\n    Then I argue: constitutional accountability reduces AI risk\n    And I present: evidence that sortition prevents elite capture\n    And I promote: transparency enabling global democratic oversight\n    And I support: recourse mechanisms providing adaptation\n    And I advocate: for protocol's distributed architecture increasing resilience\n    And I acknowledge: uncertainties about whether this suffices\n    And I work: toward governance frameworks for humanity's survival\n",
