Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult\n  As a young adult in my first full-time professional role\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want to understand my labor's value and maintain wholeness\n  So that I build professional capability while preserving personal well-being\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the young_adult user \"Aisha\" is registered in the system\n    And Aisha works full-time earning $38,000 annually\n    And this is her first professional position\n    And the workplace governance context is active\n    And the workplace_elohim could coordinate organizational care economy\n    And Aisha is learning to navigate workplace dynamics\n\n  Scenario: Understanding labor value in first professional role\n    Given Aisha is working her first full-time job\n    And she's unsure if compensation is fair\n    When the workplace_elohim analyzes her position\n    Then it should provide market rate information\n    And it should help her understand her labor's actual value\n    And it should identify if compensation is equitable\n    And the system should empower negotiation with information\n    And she should learn to advocate for fair compensation\n    And workplace care economy should make value transparent\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing when workplace demands become unsustainable\n    Given Aisha faces intense workplace expectations\n    And she often works long hours\n    When the personal_agent monitors her workplace patterns\n    Then it should flag when demands are unsustainable\n    And it should recognize that she's worked through lunch repeatedly\n    And it should identify when work-life balance is failing\n    And the system should help her see overwork clearly\n    And she should be supported in setting boundaries\n    And workplace care economy should prevent exploitation\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent helps maintain well-being during work pressure\n    Given Aisha's job is demanding\n    And professional pressures are intense\n    When work stress affects her health\n    Then the personal_agent should prioritize her well-being\n    And it should flag declining self-care patterns\n    And it should remind her that personal health enables professional contribution\n    And the system should validate self-care as essential, not optional\n    And she should learn that sustainable work requires personal stewardship\n    And wholeness should be preserved despite workplace demands\n\n  Scenario: Learning professional norms through care economy lens\n    Given Aisha is learning professional workplace culture\n    And she's developing professional identity\n    When the workplace_elohim guides her professional development\n    Then it should help her understand workplace care economy\n    And it should teach that her work is care labor (contributing to organizational flourishing)\n    And it should explain that she deserves care in return\n    And professional development should include care economy literacy\n    And she should learn to apply care principles to employment\n    And workplace norms should be understood through care framework\n\n  Scenario: Workplace skills development tracked and valued\n    Given Aisha is building professional capabilities\n    And skill development benefits both her and employer\n    When the workplace_elohim tracks her skill growth\n    Then it should recognize learning as valuable labor\n    And it should help her advocate for development opportunities\n    And it should track skills acquired for her career benefit\n    And professional growth should be visible and valued\n    And the system should ensure development serves her long-term interests\n    And skill building should be recognized as mutual investment\n\n  Scenario: Balancing workplace contribution with personal capacity\n    Given Aisha has limited energy and time\n    And workplace demands compete with personal needs\n    When Aisha allocates her care capacity\n    Then the personal_agent should help her balance commitments\n    And it should recognize that workplace care is one of multiple obligations\n    And it should flag when work encroaches on essential personal care\n    And the system should support sustainable allocation of capacity\n    And she should learn that professional success requires personal foundation\n    And work-life balance should be actively maintained\n\n  Scenario: Workplace privacy maintained from personal life\n    Given Aisha's workplace should not access personal data\n    And she has full privacy rights\n    When workplace and personal systems interact\n    Then strict privacy boundaries must be enforced\n    And workplace should have zero access to personal life data\n    And personal_agent should protect her information\n    And workplace_elohim should respect privacy completely\n    And the system should prevent workplace surveillance\n    And professional and personal spheres should remain separate\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing workplace emotional labor\n    Given Aisha performs emotional labor at work\n    And emotional labor is typically unrecognized\n    When the workplace_elohim tracks her contributions\n    Then emotional labor should be valued explicitly\n    And relationship maintenance, conflict resolution, and care for colleagues should count\n    And the full scope of her work should be visible\n    And invisible emotional work should be recognized\n    And workplace care economy should value all forms of labor\n    And she should understand emotional labor as legitimate work\n\n  Scenario: Negotiating for fair compensation with data support\n    Given Aisha deserves fair pay for her labor\n    And she lacks negotiation experience\n    When Aisha prepares for salary negotiation\n    Then the workplace_elohim should provide supporting data\n    And it should show market rates for her role\n    And it should quantify value of her contributions\n    And it should provide negotiation strategy guidance\n    And the system should empower her advocacy\n    And care economy principles should support fair compensation\n\n  Scenario: Identifying toxic workplace patterns early\n    Given Aisha is inexperienced with workplace dynamics\n    And toxic workplaces can be normalizing\n    When the workplace_elohim monitors organizational patterns\n    Then it should flag exploitative practices\n    And it should identify when workplace violates care principles\n    And it should help her recognize red flags\n    And the system should protect her from normalizing abuse\n    And she should learn what healthy workplace care looks like\n    And early warning should enable protective action\n\n  Scenario: Professional development aligned with personal values\n    Given Aisha is building her career\n    And she wants work aligned with her values\n    When Aisha makes professional development decisions\n    Then the personal_agent should help her assess value alignment\n    And it should highlight opportunities matching her principles\n    And it should flag when work conflicts with core values\n    And professional growth should support personal integrity\n    And the system should help her build career consistent with values\n    And work should serve her flourishing, not just employment\n\n  Scenario: Workplace care economy recognizes all organizational contributions\n    Given organizational success depends on many forms of labor\n    And Aisha contributes in multiple ways\n    When the workplace_elohim tracks organizational care\n    Then it should recognize diverse contributions\n    And it should value mentoring, knowledge sharing, and culture building\n    And it should make invisible organizational care visible\n    And all work supporting collective flourishing should count\n    And comprehensive care accounting should inform organizational decisions\n    And she should understand the full value she provides\n\n  Scenario: Transitioning between jobs with care economy continuity\n    Given Aisha may change jobs during her young adult years\n    And job transitions are stressful\n    When Aisha considers changing positions\n    Then the workplace_elohim should support transition planning\n    And it should help her assess new opportunities through care lens\n    And it should maintain record of skills and contributions\n    And career development should be continuous across jobs\n    And the system should support healthy professional mobility\n    And care economy principles should guide job transitions\n",
