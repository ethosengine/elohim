  "content": "Scenario: Customer spending circulates wealth in neighborhood economy\n    Given Ms. Johnson spends $900 annually at democratic ChickenMax/Maria's Kitchen\n    And multiply her spending by hundreds of neighborhood customers\n    When democratic ownership ensures value circulates locally instead of extracting\n    Then $540 of her spending goes to workers who spend in neighborhood\n    And $270 supports community programs benefiting neighbors\n    And $90 funds environmental stewardship protecting local health\n    And aggregate customer spending ($200K+ annually from regulars) massively benefits community\n    And community_elohim documents wealth circulation vs. previous corporate extraction\n",
