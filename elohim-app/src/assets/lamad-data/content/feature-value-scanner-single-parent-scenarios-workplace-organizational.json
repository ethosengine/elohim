Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent\n  As a single parent worker managing impossible work-care conflicts\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want workplace policies that recognize single parents' realities and constraints\n  So that I can sustain employment while providing sole care for my children\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the single parent user \"Maria\" is registered in the system\n    And Maria works full-time as a medical assistant earning $42k/year\n    And Maria is sole provider for household of four people\n    And she manages 100% of parenting and household labor for three children\n    And the workplace/organizational governance context is active\n    And the workplace_elohim coordinates work-care integration\n    And Maria's employer is a medical clinic with limited flexibility\n\n  Scenario: Workplace acknowledges single parents have no backup for emergencies\n    Given Maria has no co-parent to handle child illness, school emergencies, or family crises\n    And she must handle every emergency alone while maintaining employment\n    When workplace policies address family emergencies\n    Then the workplace_elohim should make visible that single parents have no backup\n    And policies should recognize emergencies are inevitable and not optional\n    And Maria should be able to handle crises without job security risk\n    And single parent realities should inform workplace family leave policies\n    And employers should understand solo parents cannot simply \"find coverage\" at home\n\n  Scenario: Schedule flexibility for solo parent managing complex logistics\n    Given Maria coordinates three children's schools, activities, and appointments alone\n    And rigid work schedules create impossible conflicts for single parents\n    When Maria's work schedule is determined\n    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for flexible scheduling options\n    And Maria should have ability to adjust hours for critical parenting needs\n    And flexibility should be policy, not personal favor requiring explanation\n    And schedule should enable sustainable work-parenting integration\n    And single parents should access flexibility without career penalty\n\n  Scenario: Living wage that enables sole provider to support family\n    Given Maria is the only income earner for household of four\n    And $42k/year is barely sustainable for her family size\n    When Maria's compensation is determined\n    Then the workplace_elohim should provide data on single parent economic needs\n    And wage should enable household flourishing, not just survival\n    And employers should understand many workers are sole household providers\n    And fair compensation should account for single-income household realities\n    And Maria should earn enough to support her family with dignity\n\n  Scenario: Sick leave adequate for sole parent who must parent while ill\n    Given Maria still parents three children even when sick\n    And she has no co-parent to take over when she's unwell\n    When Maria needs sick leave\n    Then workplace should provide adequate paid sick leave\n    And leave should cover both her own illness and children's illnesses\n    And sick leave should not be punitive or risk her job security\n    And policies should recognize single parents need more sick leave than partnered workers\n    And Maria should be able to recover and care for sick children without financial penalty\n\n  Scenario: No mandatory overtime that conflicts with solo parenting obligations\n    Given Maria must be available for her children's pickup, dinner, homework, bedtime\n    And she has no partner to cover evening parenting when she works late\n    When workplace demands overtime or schedule extensions\n    Then the workplace_elohim should flag conflicts with parenting obligations\n    And Maria should be able to refuse overtime without retaliation\n    And employers should understand single parents have non-negotiable care obligations\n    And work demands should not force choice between job and children's basic needs\n    And Maria should maintain employment boundaries necessary for parenting\n\n  Scenario: Child-related emergency leave without invasive documentation\n    Given children have emergencies requiring immediate parent presence\n    And Maria cannot ask co-parent to handle while she works\n    When Maria needs emergency leave for child crisis\n    Then she should access immediate leave without bureaucratic barriers\n    And she should not have to prove emergency legitimacy with invasive documentation\n    And emergency leave should be available quickly and with dignity\n    And workplace should trust that single parents take leave only when truly necessary\n    And Maria should handle emergencies without fear of job consequences\n\n  Scenario: Workplace recognizes Maria's professional care work in medical field\n    Given Maria's medical assistant work is professional caregiving\n    And she provides paid care work while also doing unpaid care at home\n    When Maria's professional contributions are assessed\n    Then the workplace_elohim should recognize her medical work as care labor\n    And her professional caregiving should be valued in care economy framework\n    And she should see her career as care economy participation, not separate from it\n    And care economy should include professional care work, not just household labor\n    And Maria's dual care roles should both be recognized and valued\n\n  Scenario: Advocacy for single-parent-friendly workplace policies\n    Given Maria and single parent colleagues face systemic workplace barriers\n    And employers may not understand scale of single parent challenges\n    When Maria advocates for policy improvements\n    Then the workplace_elohim should provide care economy data on single parents\n    And advocacy should be strengthened by quantified evidence of work-care conflicts\n    And Maria should be able to advocate collectively with other single parent workers\n    And care economy data should support policy changes like flexible scheduling and adequate leave\n    And workplace should adopt single-parent-friendly policies based on demonstrated needs\n\n  Scenario: Preventing work-care burnout through boundary support\n    Given Maria faces constant impossible conflicts between work and sole parenting\n    And work-care conflict is primary driver of single parent burnout\n    When the workplace_elohim monitors Maria's situation\n    Then it should detect when conflicts are becoming unsustainable\n    And it should alert Maria before burnout occurs\n    And it should help her maintain necessary boundaries with employer\n    And it should suggest interventions including policy advocacy or job changes if needed\n    And Maria should have AI support for preventing work-driven burnout\n\n  Scenario: Part-time work options during intensive parenting periods\n    Given some life stages require more intensive parenting presence\n    And Maria may need reduced hours during children's critical developmental periods\n    When Maria's care responsibilities temporarily increase\n    Then workplace should offer part-time or reduced hours options\n    And reduced schedule should not mean permanent career penalty or benefit loss\n    And single parents should be able to modulate work based on care needs\n    And career paths should accommodate care economy participation\n    And Maria should have flexibility to adjust work commitment based on family needs\n\n  Scenario: Workplace childcare assistance or subsidies\n    Given Maria pays substantial portion of income for childcare\n    And childcare costs are major burden on single-parent households\n    When Maria balances childcare needs with employment\n    Then workplace should provide childcare assistance or subsidies\n    And employer-supported childcare should reduce financial burden\n    And assistance should recognize that single parents bear full childcare costs alone\n    And workplace support should enable employment sustainability\n    And Maria should receive help with care costs that make work possible\n\n  Scenario: Protection from discrimination based on single parent status\n    Given single parents often face workplace discrimination and bias\n    And employers may view them as less committed or reliable\n    When Maria experiences workplace treatment\n    Then the workplace_elohim should monitor for single parent discrimination\n    And it should document patterns that indicate bias\n    And it should support Maria in addressing discriminatory treatment\n    And single parent status should be protected from workplace discrimination\n    And Maria should have equal opportunity regardless of family structure\n\n  Scenario: Workplace privacy protects care economy data from employer misuse\n    Given Maria participates in care economy tracking\n    And this generates data about her personal life and care responsibilities\n    When workplace seeks information about employees\n    Then Maria's personal care economy data must be completely private\n    And employers should never access her household care patterns or constraints\n    And the workplace_elohim should only see work-relevant information\n    And Maria's privacy should be absolute regarding personal care matters\n    And care economy participation should not expose her to employer surveillance\n",
