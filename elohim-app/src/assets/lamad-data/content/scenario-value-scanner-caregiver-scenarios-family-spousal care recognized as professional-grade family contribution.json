  "content": "Scenario: Spousal care recognized as professional-grade family contribution\n    Given James provides skilled nursing-level care for David\n    And this care is rendered invisible because they're married\n    When the family_elohim evaluates James's spousal care\n    Then it should be valued at professional care rates\n    And care tokens should reflect $50k+/year equivalent value\n    And \"caring for spouse out of love\" should not erase economic value\n    And family should recognize James is doing professional work\n    And spousal caregiving should be visible as enormous contribution\n    And marriage should not make care work economically invisible\n",
