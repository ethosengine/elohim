Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent\n  As a single parent building local support networks\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want to access backup care and mutual aid from neighbors\n  So that I have local resilience to supplement missing co-parent support\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the single parent user \"Maria\" is registered in the system\n    And Maria manages solo household in a neighborhood context\n    And she has no co-parent to provide backup care or emergency support\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy\n    And Maria lives in a neighborhood with other families and potential mutual aid networks\n\n  Scenario: Emergency child pickup when Maria is stuck at work\n    Given Maria's medical assistant job sometimes requires staying late unexpectedly\n    And she has no co-parent to handle emergencies\n    When Maria needs emergency child pickup from school or activities\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect her to nearby trusted neighbors\n    And neighbors who can help should be identified quickly\n    And emergency care should be available based on reciprocal care economy\n    And Maria should have backup for inevitable work-parenting conflicts\n    And neighborhood mutual aid should replace missing co-parent for emergencies\n\n  Scenario: Connecting with other single parents for resource sharing\n    Given Maria shares specific challenges and constraints with other single parents\n    And mutual support among single parents is especially valuable\n    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies community composition\n    Then it should connect Maria to other single parents in her neighborhood\n    And it should facilitate resource sharing specific to solo parenting needs\n    And it should create peer support network among those with shared experience\n    And single parents should find each other for mutual aid and understanding\n    And Maria should have neighborhood community that truly gets her situation\n\n  Scenario: Neighbor coordination for carpooling and activity transportation\n    Given Maria struggles with impossible logistics of three children's different schedules\n    And she has no partner to split transportation duties\n    When children need transportation to school, activities, and appointments\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate carpooling with other families\n    And it should match families with compatible schedules and destinations\n    And it should track reciprocal transportation contributions\n    And carpooling should reduce Maria's impossible logistics burden\n    And neighborhood coordination should make solo parenting more manageable\n\n  Scenario: Bulk purchasing coordination with neighbors for cost savings\n    Given Maria operates on severe budget constraints\n    And bulk purchasing saves money but requires coordination\n    When neighbors organize bulk buying cooperatives\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate collective purchasing\n    And it should help Maria access wholesale prices through group orders\n    And it should facilitate cost-sharing and distribution logistics\n    And bulk buying should reduce Maria's grocery costs meaningfully\n    And neighborhood economic cooperation should help single-parent resource constraints\n\n  Scenario: Tool library and resource sharing to reduce household costs\n    Given Maria needs various tools and equipment for household maintenance\n    And she cannot afford to buy everything she might occasionally need\n    When Maria needs tools or household resources\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate tool library or sharing network\n    And neighbors should be able to lend and borrow equipment\n    And Maria should access necessary resources without purchasing\n    And sharing economy should reduce costs for resource-constrained households\n    And neighborhood cooperation should enable household maintenance without partner or money\n\n  Scenario: Emergency meal provision when Maria is sick or overwhelmed\n    Given Maria has no co-parent to cook when she's sick or at breaking point\n    And she still must feed three children regardless of her state\n    When Maria faces health crisis or exhaustion emergency\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should activate meal provision network\n    And neighbors should be able to provide emergency meal support\n    And Maria should receive help based on her care economy standing, not charity\n    And emergency support should be dignified and reciprocal\n    And neighborhood should serve as backup for solo parent crisis\n\n  Scenario: After-school supervision coordination for latchkey prevention\n    Given Maria works until 5pm while school ends at 3pm\n    And she cannot afford formal after-school care for three children\n    When children need supervision between school and Maria's work end\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate informal after-school care\n    And it should connect Maria to neighbors who are home during those hours\n    And it should track reciprocal care contributions to maintain fairness\n    And neighborhood coordination should provide affordable childcare solution\n    And Maria's children should have safe supervision despite her work schedule\n\n  Scenario: Weekend respite care for desperately needed breaks\n    Given Maria parents intensively seven days per week with no co-parent breaks\n    And everyone needs occasional rest to remain sustainable\n    When Maria needs brief respite from parenting demands\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate respite care offers\n    And neighbors should be able to take her children for a few hours\n    And Maria should be able to accept respite without guilt or stigma\n    And respite should be framed as care economy reciprocity, not charity\n    And Maria should get occasional breaks that partnered parents get from co-parents\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood watch and safety network for single-parent families\n    Given Maria worries about household and child safety as solo parent\n    And she cannot be everywhere at once\n    When neighborhood safety networks operate\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate neighborhood watch efforts\n    And neighbors should look out for each other's children and properties\n    And Maria should feel enhanced security through community vigilance\n    And single-parent households should benefit from neighborhood collective care\n    And safety should be community responsibility, not solo parent burden\n\n  Scenario: Skill sharing network for household tasks Maria cannot do alone\n    Given some household tasks are difficult or impossible for one person\n    And Maria cannot afford to hire professionals for everything\n    When Maria needs help with household tasks requiring multiple people or specialized skills\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate skill sharing network\n    And neighbors should exchange help based on different capabilities\n    And Maria should access household help through reciprocal labor exchange\n    And skill sharing should enable household maintenance without money or partner\n    And neighborhood cooperation should solve single-parent capability gaps\n\n  Scenario: Local economic cooperation for service cost reduction\n    Given Maria struggles to afford household services on limited income\n    And neighbors might coordinate for collective cost reduction\n    When neighborhood members need similar services\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate group contracting\n    And collective service hiring should reduce costs for all participants\n    And Maria should access affordable household services through cooperation\n    And neighborhood economic coordination should address resource constraints\n    And single parents should benefit from collective bargaining power\n\n  Scenario: Preventing social isolation through neighborhood integration\n    Given solo parenting is profoundly isolating\n    And Maria has limited time and energy for social connection\n    When the neighborhood_elohim monitors Maria's social engagement\n    Then it should facilitate low-effort neighborhood social integration\n    And it should connect her to neighborhood gatherings and events\n    And it should enable participation without requiring excessive time or energy\n    And neighborhood should provide adult social connection Maria lacks from co-parent\n    And Maria should have accessible pathways to community membership despite constraints\n",
