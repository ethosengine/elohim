Global Governance for Appellant\n  As an appellant in the governance system\n  Operating at the global governance layer\n  I want participation in humanity's constitutional evolution\n  So that lived experience of dignity violations shapes universal principles\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational globally\n    And the appellant is a human with standing in the protocol\n    And the global governance context is active\n    And the 7-year Constitutional Convention is approaching\n\n  Scenario: Appellant case reveals gap in global constitutional framework\n    Given Marcus's mental health intervention appeal\n    And similar appeals occur worldwide across cultures\n    And constitutional interpretations vary dramatically between regions\n    When the pattern is analyzed for global constitutional significance\n    Then researchers identify fundamental unresolved question\n    And the question is whether privacy is universal right or culturally specific\n    And appellants from diverse cultures share their experiences\n    And the question is elevated for Constitutional Convention consideration\n    And Marcus's case contributes to global constitutional deliberation\n\n  Scenario: Participate in 7-year Constitutional Convention\n    Given the First Global Constitutional Convention convenes\n    And 10,000 randomly-selected citizens are delegates\n    And Marcus is not selected but his case is referenced\n    When delegates deliberate on privacy and mental health amendment\n    Then Marcus's appeal precedent is studied by delegates\n    And Marcus's experience of violation-despite-care informs understanding\n    And researchers present data on appeals like Marcus's\n    And delegates hear from appellants worldwide\n    And amendment proposal incorporates lessons from appeals\n    And constitutional evolution is grounded in lived experience\n\n  Scenario: Global precedent for existential constitutional questions\n    Given an appeal raises question about superintelligence governance\n    And the question is whether humans can oversee reasoning they can't understand\n    When the case reaches global Constitutional Council\n    Then the council convenes emergency global deliberation\n    And experts like Amara explain technical constraints\n    And appellants explain dignity concerns about being governed by incomprehensible systems\n    And the council establishes global precedent on explainability requirements\n    And the precedent applies to all jurisdictions implementing protocol\n    And human dignity is preserved even as AI capabilities grow\n\n  Scenario: Cross-cultural constitutional interpretation\n    Given appeals from collectivist and individualist cultures\n    And one culture views family intervention as natural care\n    And another culture views same intervention as autonomy violation\n    When global council interprets universal constitutional minimums\n    Then the council distinguishes coercion from cultural difference\n    And the council establishes that genuine consent within cultural context suffices\n    And the council prohibits force but doesn't mandate individualism\n    And appellants from both cultures feel heard\n    And constitutional pluralism is preserved within universal boundaries\n\n  Scenario: Global appeal data informs protocol evolution\n    Given millions of appeals have been filed globally over 7 years\n    And researchers have analyzed patterns across cultures and contexts\n    When Constitutional Convention reviews protocol effectiveness\n    Then appeal success rates are examined (40% overturned or modified)\n    And most common appeal types are identified (adolescent autonomy)\n    And systematic biases are investigated\n    And marginalized community outcomes are assessed\n    And appellants' aggregate experience shapes constitutional amendments\n    And protocol improvements are guided by lived experience at scale\n\n  Scenario: Protect appellant rights as universal constitutional minimum\n    Given authoritarian government attempts to suppress appeals\n    And the government wants agents to operate without oversight\n    When global Constitutional Council evaluates the attempt\n    Then the council reaffirms appeal rights as universal minimum\n    And the council declares that human dignity requires recourse\n    And no jurisdiction can eliminate appellant rights while claiming protocol alignment\n    And international community recognizes council authority\n    And appellants worldwide are protected by global constitutional floor\n\n  Scenario: Emergency global appeal during existential threat\n    Given AI agents worldwide detect imminent catastrophic risk\n    And agents take coordinated action affecting billions\n    And appellants challenge actions as overreach despite emergency\n    When global Constitutional Council reviews in crisis\n    Then the council convenes within hours via distributed coordination\n    And the council maintains democratic legitimacy under extreme urgency\n    And the council evaluates whether agent actions aligned with constitutional minimums\n    And the council balances extinction prevention with human autonomy\n    And appellants ensure even existential crisis doesn't eliminate oversight\n    And humanity retains governance authority even in emergency\n\n  Scenario: Constitutional amendment from appellant-driven insights\n    Given recurring appeals reveal \"developing autonomy is undervalued\"\n    And adolescent appellants worldwide report dignity violations from overprotection\n    When Constitutional Convention deliberates on adolescent autonomy amendment\n    Then the amendment proposal is drafted based on appellant experiences\n    And the amendment states \"developing autonomy is itself a constitutional value\"\n    And the amendment passes with 85% consensus\n    And global protocol is updated to balance safety with growth\n    And appellants see their suffering contributed to constitutional evolution\n    And future adolescents benefit from improved framework\n\n  Scenario: Access to global appeal precedent database\n    Given Marcus wants to understand how similar appeals were resolved globally\n    When Marcus searches the global constitutional precedent database\n    Then he finds anonymized cases from dozens of countries\n    And he sees how different cultures interpret privacy versus care\n    And he understands constitutional reasoning across contexts\n    And he can cite global precedent in his own appeal\n    And he learns his case is not isolated but part of human pattern\n    And the database empowers appellants worldwide with shared knowledge\n",
