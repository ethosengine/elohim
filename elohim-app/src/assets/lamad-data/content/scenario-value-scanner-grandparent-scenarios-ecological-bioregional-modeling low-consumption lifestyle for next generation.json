  "content": "Scenario: Modeling low-consumption lifestyle for next generation\n    Given Margaret lives simply on retirement income\n    And her low-consumption lifestyle has low environmental impact\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks consumption patterns\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's low-impact lifestyle as ecological contribution\n    And it should value simple living as environmental stewardship\n    And it should show grandchildren that fulfillment doesn't require high consumption\n    And low-impact living should be recognized as climate action\n    And Margaret's lifestyle should model sustainable living\n    And intergenerational value transmission should support sustainability\n",
