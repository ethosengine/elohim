  "content": "Scenario: Teen's care contributions prevent exploitation within family\n    Given Jasmine contributes substantial household labor\n    And there is risk of teen labor being exploited even within families\n    When Jasmine's care contributions exceed healthy boundaries\n    Then the family_elohim should flag potential exploitation\n    And surface if Jasmine's responsibilities are preventing her development\n    And recognize if she's providing excessive childcare or household labor\n    And prompt family discussion about fair distribution of care work\n    And protect Jasmine from being trapped in unpaid household labor\n    And ensure her contributions are recognized and not taken for granted\n",
