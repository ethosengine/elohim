Household Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent\n  As a grandparent coordinating care work within my household\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want fair distribution of grandparenting labor and household impact\n  So that care for grandchildren enhances rather than strains our household\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the grandparent user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret is married to \"Robert\" who is also retired\n    And they share a household with joint resources and decisions\n    And Margaret provides 25 hours/week grandchild care\n    And Robert has his own retirement activities and interests\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And the household_elohim coordinates care work distribution\n\n  Scenario: Distributing grandparenting labor equitably between partners\n    Given both Margaret and Robert are retired and available\n    And Margaret currently does most of the grandchild care\n    When the household_elohim tracks care contributions\n    Then it should show Margaret's 25 hours/week of grandchild care\n    And it should show Robert's care contributions (if any)\n    And it should identify if care labor is unequally distributed\n    And it should facilitate discussion about equitable distribution\n    And both partners should contribute to grandparenting\n    And Margaret should not bear sole burden of care work\n    And household care economy should be equitable\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating household schedule around grandparenting commitments\n    Given Margaret provides childcare three days per week\n    And this affects household availability and flexibility\n    When the household plans activities and commitments\n    Then the household_elohim should coordinate around care schedule\n    And it should recognize grandparenting as household commitment\n    And it should help both partners plan around care days\n    And household decisions should account for care obligations\n    And Margaret's care work should be treated as serious commitment\n    And the household should operate as team around grandparenting\n\n  Scenario: Household resource allocation for grandparenting expenses\n    Given grandparenting involves costs (activities, supplies, treats, transportation)\n    And Margaret and Robert share household finances\n    When the household budgets for grandparenting expenses\n    Then the household_elohim should track all grandparenting costs\n    And it should help budget for these as household expenses\n    And it should distinguish between household costs and reimbursable family costs\n    And both partners should agree on grandparenting spending\n    And household resources should support care provision without strain\n    And financial planning should include grandparenting expenses\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining household identity and couple time amid care work\n    Given Margaret and Robert are navigating retirement together\n    And they have their own relationship and household life\n    When Margaret provides substantial grandchild care\n    Then the household_elohim should protect couple time\n    And it should ensure grandparenting doesn't consume all household capacity\n    And it should help maintain balance between care and relationship\n    And Margaret and Robert should have time as a couple\n    And household identity should extend beyond grandparenting\n    And the system should support healthy household boundaries\n\n  Scenario: Household space and logistics for grandchild care\n    Given Margaret cares for grandchildren in their household\n    And this requires child-friendly space and supplies\n    When the household_elohim tracks space usage\n    Then it should recognize household space devoted to grandchild care\n    And it should help maintain appropriate supplies (toys, books, safety items)\n    And it should coordinate space needs with household preferences\n    And both partners should agree on household modifications for care\n    And home should serve both grandparenting and household needs\n    And space allocation should be mutually agreed\n\n  Scenario: Impact of care work on household energy and capacity\n    Given Margaret is 68 and active grandchild care is physically demanding\n    And 25 hours/week of childcare affects household energy\n    When the household_elohim monitors capacity\n    Then it should track if care work is affecting Margaret's well-being\n    And it should recognize when care burden is too high\n    And it should help household discuss sustainable care levels\n    And Robert should understand and support Margaret's capacity\n    And household should be able to negotiate care boundaries with family\n    And both partners' well-being should be protected\n\n  Scenario: Household decision-making about grandparenting commitments\n    Given grandparenting commitments affect both household members\n    And decisions should be made jointly\n    When the family requests additional care or changes\n    Then the household_elohim should facilitate joint decision-making\n    And both Margaret and Robert should agree on care commitments\n    And household should speak with one voice to family\n    And care arrangements should serve household needs and capacity\n    And neither partner should unilaterally commit to care\n    And household governance should be respected by extended family\n\n  Scenario: Reciprocal care between Margaret and Robert as they age\n    Given Margaret and Robert are both aging\n    And they will increasingly need to care for each other\n    When the household_elohim tracks household care patterns\n    Then it should recognize reciprocal care between partners\n    And it should show how they support each other's well-being\n    And it should value care they provide to each other\n    And household care economy should include partner care\n    And both should accumulate care tokens for caring for each other\n    And the system should support their aging together with dignity\n\n  Scenario: Household participation in multigenerational care coordination\n    Given Margaret provides care both to grandchildren and her elderly mother\n    And Robert provides support to his own aging family\n    When the household coordinates all care obligations\n    Then the household_elohim should track all family care commitments\n    And it should help balance multiple care responsibilities\n    And it should prevent household care burden from becoming excessive\n    And both partners should understand total household care load\n    And household should be able to set sustainable boundaries\n    And care obligations should be manageable and sustainable\n\n  Scenario: Household transportation logistics for care provision\n    Given Margaret transports grandchildren to activities and appointments\n    And this uses household vehicle and resources\n    When the household_elohim tracks transportation\n    Then it should recognize transportation as care work\n    And it should track vehicle use, gas costs, wear and tear\n    And it should coordinate transportation between partners\n    And it should help determine when family should reimburse costs\n    And household transportation resources should be managed fairly\n    And both partners should share transportation care labor\n\n  Scenario: Retirement planning affected by grandparenting commitments\n    Given Margaret and Robert had retirement plans and dreams\n    And substantial grandparenting changes household capacity for travel and activities\n    When the household plans retirement lifestyle\n    Then the household_elohim should help balance care and retirement goals\n    And it should ensure grandparenting doesn't entirely subsume retirement plans\n    And it should help negotiate sustainable care arrangements\n    And both partners should be able to enjoy retirement\n    And household should maintain autonomy over retirement choices\n    And grandparenting should enhance rather than replace retirement\n\n  Scenario: Household health management while providing care\n    Given both Margaret and Robert have health considerations\n    And Margaret's care work requires physical and mental energy\n    When the household_elohim monitors health impacts\n    Then it should track whether care work affects Margaret's health\n    And it should ensure both partners maintain health appointments and self-care\n    And it should alert if care burden is compromising well-being\n    And household health should be prioritized alongside care provision\n    And both partners should support each other's health management\n    And the system should enable sustainable care without health sacrifice\n",
