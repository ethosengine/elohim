  "content": "Scenario: Financial constraint management without stigma\n    Given Helen's fixed income is $24k/year\n    And this is severe resource constraint\n    When Helen uses the Value Scanner for purchasing decisions\n    Then the system should help her navigate financial limits\n    And budget assistance should be provided with dignity\n    And no shame should be attached to limited resources\n    And community care economy connections should be surfaced\n    And food assistance should be presented as legitimate reciprocity\n    And her lifetime of contributions should create valid claims on support\n    And assistance should flow with respect, not charity\n",
