  "content": "Scenario: Responsible developer benefits from climate adaptation standards\n    Given a developer invests in climate-resilient building practices\n    And exceeds flood protection and heat mitigation requirements\n    When the Observer documents climate adaptation performance\n    Then the developer shows: flood resilience investment prevented $2M damages\n    And urban heat island mitigation reduced cooling costs 30%\n    And climate adaptation creates long-term property value\n    And responsible practices gain competitive advantage as climate risks increase\n    And genuine adaptation distinguishes from minimal compliance\n",
