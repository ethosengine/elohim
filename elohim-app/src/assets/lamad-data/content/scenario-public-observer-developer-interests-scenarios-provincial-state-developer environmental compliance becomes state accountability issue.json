  "content": "Scenario: Developer environmental compliance becomes state accountability issue\n    Given a developer's projects consistently violate state environmental standards\n    But receives minimal enforcement from state regulators\n    When the Observer documents violation patterns and regulatory response\n    Then analysis shows: 67 violations across 8 projects over 5 years\n    And penalties total $180K while profits exceed $40M\n    And state regulators approve new permits despite violation history\n    And regulatory capture becomes statistically undeniable\n    And developer faces pressure for genuine environmental compliance\n",
