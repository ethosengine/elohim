  "content": "Scenario: Integrating municipal services with protocol coordination\n    Given city provides services (water, waste, transit, parks)\n    And these need coordination with protocol resource flows\n    When I integrate municipal services with Elohim coordination\n    Then city departments: share data with agents appropriately\n    And Municipal Elohim: helps optimize service delivery\n    And environmental services: coordinate with Ecosystem Elohim\n    And social services: work with Community Elohim for crisis response\n    And integration respects: department professional judgment\n    And agents augment: not replace city workers\n    And public services improve: through better coordination\n",
