  "content": "@epic:value_scanner\n@user_type:young_child\n@governance_layer:individual\n@related_users:parent,child,grandparent\n@related_layers:family,educational\n@elohim_agents:personal_agent\n\nFeature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Young Child\n  As a young child (ages 5-7) in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want my personal choices and care contributions to be recognized\n  So that I learn that my agency matters and care creates value\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the young_child user \"Tommy\" is registered in the system\n    And Tommy is 5 years old\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Tommy's personal_agent is configured for wonder preservation\n    And parental oversight is enabled\n\n  Scenario: Wonder-preserving interface for making care choices\n    Given Tommy is using the Value Scanner for the first time\n    And the interface is optimized for ages 5-7\n    When Tommy opens the scanner application\n    Then the interface should display large, colorful icons\n    And the personal_agent should use warm, encouraging voice guidance\n    And no text requiring reading ability should be mandatory\n    And the interface should preserve the magic of choice-making\n    And no gamification or point systems should be present\n\n  Scenario: Young child makes autonomous care decision within boundaries\n    Given Tommy is selecting fruit for his sister Emma\n    And Emma has nut allergies configured in the system\n    And the family budget constraints are active\n    When Tommy scans strawberries for Emma\n    Then his personal_agent should recognize the care intention\n    And the agent should say \"Remember, Emma loves the red ones\"\n    And the choice should be recorded as a care contribution\n    And Tommy should experience genuine autonomy\n    And invisible guardrails should prevent allergen selection\n    And Tommy should not be aware of the protective boundaries\n\n  Scenario: Recognition of invisible care labor by 5-year-old\n    Given Tommy has chosen strawberries for his sister Emma\n    And the care contribution has been recorded\n    When the transaction is complete\n    Then Tommy's care work should be made visible to the family\n    And his personal_agent should provide warm recognition\n    And the agent should say \"You helped. Your care matters. You made Emma happy.\"\n    And the recognition should feel like love, not data extraction\n    And care tokens should be allocated to reflect his contribution\n    And no transactional language should be used\n\n  Scenario: Developmental stage appropriate learning through concrete experience\n    Given Tommy is learning value literacy\n    And he is at the concrete operational stage\n    When Tommy makes a care decision in the scanner\n    Then the personal_agent should frame choices as care adventures\n    And complex economic concepts should not be presented\n    And learning should happen through story and relationship\n    And the agent should ask \"What will make Emma smile?\" not \"What's the best value?\"\n    And Tommy should build neural pathways around care-based decision making\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent serves child's flourishing without manipulation\n    Given Tommy's personal_agent has AI capabilities\n    And Tommy is highly vulnerable to manipulation\n    When the personal_agent interacts with Tommy\n    Then it must never manipulate through guilt or shame\n    And it must never extract data for commercial purposes\n    And it must never train Tommy toward consumption patterns\n    And it must serve only Tommy's dignity and flourishing\n    And it must preserve Tommy's natural generosity from corruption\n    And it must set Tommy's baseline expectation that technology serves humans\n\n  Scenario: Privacy protection for young child's data\n    Given Tommy's care contributions are being tracked\n    And Tommy cannot consent to data sharing\n    When Tommy's care data is recorded\n    Then all data must stay encrypted on family devices\n    And no behavioral profiling for commercial purposes should occur\n    And no third-party access should be permitted\n    And Tommy's wonder must never be monetized\n    And parental controls must govern all data visibility\n    And anonymization must occur before any community aggregation\n\n  Scenario: Age-appropriate boundaries feel like safety not surveillance\n    Given Tommy's parents have configured family boundaries\n    And allergen restrictions are active (Emma's nut allergy)\n    And budget limits are set\n    And nutritional guidelines are configured\n    When Tommy attempts to select an item outside boundaries\n    Then the system should gently redirect without explicit restriction\n    And Tommy should experience boundaries as natural limits\n    And the personal_agent should explain in care terms: \"Let's find something Emma can safely eat\"\n    And Tommy should not feel surveilled or controlled\n    And his autonomy should remain genuine within safe parameters\n\n  Scenario: Building identity around care rather than consumption\n    Given Tommy has made multiple care contributions over time\n    And the system has recognized his caring actions\n    When Tommy reflects on his scanner usage\n    Then he should experience himself as a valued contributor\n    And his identity should be forming around care for others\n    And he should understand that invisible work is actually valuable\n    And he should not be conditioned toward consumer identity\n    And care economy principles should be internalized through experience\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent adapts to individual child's developmental pace\n    Given Tommy is 5 years old\n    And his developmental pace may differ from age-based averages\n    When the personal_agent interacts with Tommy over time\n    Then it should observe Tommy's actual capabilities\n    And it should adapt guidance to his individual pace\n    And it should not enforce rigid age-based expectations\n    And it should support Tommy's unique development\n    And learning should be paced to Tommy's readiness\n\n  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained even for young child\n    Given Tommy has been using the Value Scanner\n    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers\n    When Tommy or his parents choose to disconnect\n    Then the system must honor the disconnection immediately\n    And no data retention beyond legal requirements should occur\n    And Tommy's right to not participate must be respected\n    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed\n",
