Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Student\n  As a student studying environmental science and developing ecological awareness\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want to connect personal choices to planetary care and understand ecological stewardship\n  So that I develop integrated care economy practice from individual to planetary scale\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the student user \"Kenji\" is registered in the system\n    And Kenji is studying environmental science\n    And Kenji has academic knowledge of ecological systems\n    And Kenji makes daily consumption choices with limited budget\n    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active\n    And the bioregional_elohim could connect personal actions to ecological impact\n    And Kenji wants his life aligned with environmental values\n\n  Scenario: Connecting grocery shopping to ecological care economy\n    Given Kenji shops for food on $50/week budget\n    And food choices have ecological impact\n    When the bioregional_elohim helps Kenji make food decisions\n    Then it should show ecological impact of different food choices\n    And it should help him identify low-impact foods within budget\n    And it should recognize \"Choosing dried beans over beef reduces ecological impact\"\n    And it should show how budget constraint can align with ecological care\n    And the system should connect personal shopping to planetary stewardship\n    And Kenji should see grocery choices as ecological care work\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing resource constraint as ecological practice\n    Given Kenji's $180/week budget forces minimal consumption\n    And ecological sustainability requires reduced consumption\n    When the bioregional_elohim reframes Kenji's scarcity\n    Then it should recognize that living on limited resources is low ecological impact\n    And it should validate \"Your minimal consumption is ecological stewardship\"\n    And it should show how his constrained lifestyle aligns with sustainability\n    And resource constraint should be recognized as ecological care\n    And the system should honor scarcity as ecological practice\n    And Kenji should understand his poverty as inadvertently sustainable\n\n  Scenario: Food waste reduction as ecological care work\n    Given Kenji cannot afford to waste food\n    And food waste has significant ecological cost\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food waste reduction\n    Then it should recognize Kenji's waste prevention as ecological care\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for using all ingredients\n    And it should value creative cooking with leftovers\n    And it should show \"Zero food waste this week = ecological contribution\"\n    And waste reduction should be recognized as care economy work\n    And Kenji's efficient resource use should be valued ecologically\n\n  Scenario: Understanding bioregional food systems\n    Given Kenji's food comes from complex global supply chains\n    And bioregional food systems are more sustainable\n    When the bioregional_elohim educates about food sourcing\n    Then it should show him where his food comes from\n    And it should help him identify local and seasonal options within budget\n    And it should teach him about bioregional food production\n    And it should connect his shopping to support for local food systems\n    And the system should build bioregional food literacy\n    And Kenji should understand food through ecological and regional lens\n\n  Scenario: Academic learning applied to daily ecological choices\n    Given Kenji studies environmental science academically\n    And he makes consumption decisions daily\n    When the bioregional_elohim connects learning to practice\n    Then it should help him apply academic knowledge to personal choices\n    And it should show \"Your understanding of nitrogen cycles informs food decisions\"\n    And it should bridge theory and practice\n    And it should recognize his daily life as laboratory for ecological care\n    And the system should integrate academic and practical ecological knowledge\n    And Kenji should live his environmental science education\n\n  Scenario: Ecological impact of household coordination\n    Given Kenji lives with three roommates\n    And household coordination can reduce ecological impact\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks household ecological practices\n    Then it should recognize shared living as ecologically efficient\n    And it should show how cooking for four is more efficient than four cooking separately\n    And it should value household bulk buying as reducing packaging waste\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for ecological household practices\n    And the system should recognize household coordination as ecological care\n    And shared living should be valued as sustainability practice\n\n  Scenario: Transportation choices and ecological impact\n    Given Kenji walks most places due to lack of car\n    And walking has minimal ecological impact\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks transportation\n    Then it should recognize walking as ecological care contribution\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for low-impact transportation\n    And it should show \"Walking instead of driving prevented X carbon emissions\"\n    And it should validate that poverty can align with ecological values\n    And the system should recognize low-impact mobility as care work\n    And Kenji should see his car-free life as ecological stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Connecting personal consumption to planetary boundaries\n    Given Kenji's consumption choices aggregate with billions of others\n    And planetary boundaries define sustainable resource use\n    When the bioregional_elohim shows planetary context\n    Then it should help Kenji understand his consumption in global context\n    And it should show \"Your consumption is well below sustainable average\"\n    And it should connect personal choices to planetary care economy\n    And it should teach him that individual actions scale to collective impact\n    And the system should bridge personal and planetary scales\n    And Kenji should understand himself as participant in planetary care economy\n\n  Scenario: Campus environmental advocacy as ecological care work\n    Given Kenji's college has environmental impact and policies\n    And students can advocate for institutional sustainability\n    When Kenji participates in campus environmental organizing\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize advocacy as ecological care work\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for environmental activism\n    And it should value organizing for institutional change\n    And it should recognize that systemic change requires collective action\n    And the system should support student environmental advocacy\n    And campus organizing should be understood as ecological care economy work\n\n  Scenario: Learning bioregional ecological patterns\n    Given Kenji lives in specific bioregion with unique ecology\n    And bioregional awareness is core to ecological care\n    When the bioregional_elohim teaches about local ecology\n    Then it should help Kenji learn local watershed, species, and ecosystems\n    And it should connect him to bioregional natural patterns\n    And it should show seasonal changes and ecological cycles\n    And it should build his sense of place in bioregional context\n    And the system should foster bioregional ecological literacy\n    And Kenji should understand himself as member of bioregional community\n\n  Scenario: Future career aligned with ecological care economy\n    Given Kenji studies environmental science for future career\n    And he wants work that serves ecological flourishing\n    When the bioregional_elohim supports career development\n    Then it should help him identify care economy environmental careers\n    And it should connect his learning to ecological stewardship work\n    And it should validate environmental work as care economy contribution\n    And it should support him developing career serving planetary flourishing\n    And the system should recognize ecological professions as care work\n    And Kenji's career should serve care economy at planetary scale\n\n  Scenario: Distinguishing ecological care from greenwashing\n    Given many products and institutions claim environmental responsibility falsely\n    And Kenji needs to distinguish genuine ecological care from marketing\n    When the bioregional_elohim helps Kenji evaluate environmental claims\n    Then it should teach him to recognize greenwashing\n    And it should help him identify genuinely sustainable practices\n    And it should build critical ecological literacy\n    And it should protect him from false environmental marketing\n    And the system should teach sophisticated ecological analysis\n    And Kenji should distinguish real care economy from extractive economy in green clothing\n\n  Scenario: Ecological care as spiritual and ethical practice\n    Given Kenji's environmental values are deeply held\n    And ecological care connects to meaning and purpose\n    When the bioregional_elohim supports Kenji's values\n    Then it should recognize ecological stewardship as ethical practice\n    And it should validate his care for planet as meaningful\n    And it should connect ecological care to larger purpose\n    And it should support integration of values across life domains\n    And the system should honor ecological care as spiritual practice\n    And Kenji should experience planetary care as part of life meaning\n\n  Scenario: Student generation as agents of ecological transformation\n    Given Kenji's generation will inherit climate crisis and ecological breakdown\n    And students are developing patterns that will shape future\n    When the bioregional_elohim recognizes generational context\n    Then it should validate student ecological anxiety and grief\n    And it should empower students as agents of ecological transformation\n    And it should support collective action for systemic change\n    And it should recognize that care economy is ecological imperative\n    And the system should foster student leadership in ecological care\n    And Kenji's generation should be empowered to build ecological care economy\n",
