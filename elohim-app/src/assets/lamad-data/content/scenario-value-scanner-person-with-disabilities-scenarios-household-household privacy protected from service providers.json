  "content": "Scenario: Household privacy protected from service providers\n    Given support workers and service providers enter Alex's household\n    And this creates potential privacy vulnerabilities\n    When household data is collected\n    Then Alex should control what household information is shared with service providers\n    And support workers should access only information necessary for their tasks\n    And Alex's medical and personal information should remain private\n    And household patterns should not be shared without Alex's consent\n    And the household_elohim should protect Alex's privacy systematically\n    And Alex should feel secure in their own home\n    And privacy protections should be robust even with frequent visitors\n",
