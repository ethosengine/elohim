Democratic Farm Governance and Farmworker Empowerment\n  As a supplier in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer\n  I want farmworkers to gain ownership and democratic voice\n  So that farm transforms from hierarchical extraction to democratic stewardship\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Tom Johnson operates Johnson Farm serving EAE food service network\n    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active\n    And fair farmer compensation enables considering democratic conversion\n\n  Scenario: Farm owner transitions from sole proprietor to worker cooperative facilitator\n    Given Tom has owned and operated Johnson Farm individually for 20 years\n    And farmworkers have been employees without ownership or governance voice\n    When Tom considers converting farm to worker-owned cooperative\n    Then he sees how democratic restaurant conversions empowered workers\n    And EAE network offers acquisition support for farm democratic conversion\n    And Tom can transition from sole owner to cooperative member or honored exit\n    And farmworkers gain ownership pathway transforming agricultural labor\n    And workplace_elohim facilitates farm conversion following restaurant model\n\n  Scenario: Farmworker expertise in cultivation becomes valued in democratic governance\n    Given farmworkers have deep knowledge of soil, crops, and seasonal patterns\n    And hierarchical structure meant their expertise was undervalued or ignored\n    When democratic governance gives farmworkers decision-making voice\n    Then cultivation decisions incorporate workers' hands-on expertise\n    And crop selection reflects workers' knowledge of land and climate\n    And planting and harvesting schedules balance productivity with worker wellbeing\n    And farmworker wisdom shapes farm operations through democratic participation\n    And workplace_elohim documents farmworker knowledge and decision contributions\n\n  Scenario: Farm labor practices improve through worker democratic control\n    Given Tom paid farmworkers as well as possible but margins were thin\n    And workers lacked voice in schedule, breaks, safety, or working conditions\n    When farmworkers gain democratic ownership and governance\n    Then wages increase to $18/hour minimum from increased farm revenue (direct sales, fair pricing)\n    And work schedules accommodate workers' family and health needs\n    And safety equipment and protocols improve through worker input\n    And agricultural labor transforms from exploited work to dignified livelihood\n    And workplace_elohim ensures democratic governance protects farmworker dignity\n\n  Scenario: Seasonal labor challenges are addressed through democratic planning\n    Given agricultural work is inherently seasonal creating income volatility\n    And farmworkers traditionally face periods of unemployment and poverty\n    When democratic governance addresses seasonal labor democratically\n    Then year-round base income is guaranteed through diversified farm activities\n    And off-season work includes equipment maintenance, planning, and training\n    And EAE network coordination provides cross-employment opportunities during slow periods\n    And income stability improves farmworker financial security dramatically\n    And workplace_elohim coordinates seasonal labor solutions across network\n\n  Scenario: Farm equipment investment decisions become democratically governed\n    Given equipment purchases previously were Tom's sole decision\n    And workers who use equipment daily had no input on purchases\n    When democratic governance includes workers in equipment decisions\n    Then farmworkers evaluate equipment options based on usability and safety\n    And purchases prioritize worker wellbeing alongside productivity\n    And equipment maintenance improves through worker ownership and care\n    And investment decisions reflect users' expertise and long-term thinking\n    And workplace_elohim facilitates democratic equipment planning and budgeting\n\n  Scenario: Crop diversity increases through democratic decision-making\n    Given Tom focused on high-value crops to maximize revenue under thin margins\n    And crop diversity benefits soil health and risk distribution\n    When democratic governance enables longer-term thinking\n    Then workers vote to increase crop diversity supporting soil health\n    And diversification reduces dependence on single crop market fluctuations\n    And biodiversity increases through worker interest in varied cultivation\n    And farm resilience improves through democratic long-term planning\n    And workplace_elohim documents crop diversity benefits for economic and ecological health\n\n  Scenario: Farm knowledge transfer becomes systematic institutional practice\n    Given Tom's knowledge was concentrated in his experience and tacit expertise\n    And knowledge loss would occur if he exited without systematic transfer\n    When democratic conversion requires knowledge documentation\n    Then Tom's expertise is systematically documented and shared with worker-owners\n    And apprenticeship programs formalize knowledge transfer to new farmworkers\n    And institutional memory develops preventing knowledge loss through turnover\n    And democratic governance ensures continuous learning and knowledge circulation\n    And workplace_elohim manages knowledge transfer protocols and documentation\n\n  Scenario: Farmworker recruitment and retention improve through ownership opportunity\n    Given agricultural labor traditionally has high turnover due to low pay and poor conditions\n    And farm struggled to retain skilled workers who left for better opportunities\n    When democratic ownership offers farmworkers equity stake and voice\n    Then recruitment improves as workers seek dignified agricultural employment\n    And retention increases dramatically (90%+ vs. previous 40% annual retention)\n    And institutional expertise accumulates through stable workforce\n    And farm benefits from long-term worker commitment and skill development\n    And workplace_elohim tracks retention improvements and workforce stability\n\n  Scenario: Democratic governance enables farm innovation through worker collaboration\n    Given individual owner structure limited innovation to Tom's ideas and capacity\n    And workers had innovative ideas but no mechanism to implement them\n    When democratic governance values all workers' innovative contributions\n    Then cultivation technique improvements emerge from farmworker experimentation\n    And workflow optimizations are tested and refined collaboratively\n    And sustainable practice innovations spread through worker knowledge sharing\n    And collective intelligence exceeds individual owner capacity\n    And workplace_elohim documents innovations and shares across democratic farm network\n\n  Scenario: Farm financial transparency builds trust and informed decision-making\n    Given farmworkers previously had no visibility into farm finances\n    And lack of transparency created distrust and uninformed compensation discussions\n    When democratic governance requires financial transparency\n    Then farmworkers see complete financial picture: revenue, costs, margins, investments\n    And compensation decisions are informed by transparent profit distribution\n    And financial education is provided helping workers understand farm economics\n    And trust builds through transparency replacing suspicion from opacity\n    And workplace_elohim provides financial transparency dashboards for democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Farmworker voice prevents owner burnout and distributes responsibility\n    Given Tom carried full farm responsibility alone causing stress and burnout\n    And sole proprietorship meant he couldn't take breaks without farm crisis\n    When democratic governance distributes responsibility across worker-owners\n    Then Tom (if staying as cooperative member) is freed from sole responsibility burden\n    And farmworkers collectively manage farm reducing individual stress\n    And vacation and health breaks become possible for all including Tom\n    And democratic distribution of responsibility enables sustainable work-life balance\n    And workplace_elohim ensures responsibility distribution is equitable and sustainable\n\n  Scenario: Farm democratic conversion attracts younger generation to agriculture\n    Given young people avoid agriculture due to low pay and lack of ownership pathway\n    And aging farmer population threatens agricultural knowledge and capacity loss\n    When democratic farm offers ownership, dignity, and fair compensation\n    Then young people consider agricultural careers with ownership potential\n    And generational knowledge transfer occurs through young farmworkers learning from elders\n    And sustainable agriculture future is secured through attracting next generation\n    And democratic model makes farming viable and attractive livelihood\n    And workplace_elohim documents youth engagement in democratic agriculture\n",
