Community Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult\n  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want to participate in community governance as both participant and leader\n  So that I can leverage my accumulated experience to shape care economy systems and mentor the next generation\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the middle-aged user \"Robert\" is registered in the system\n    And Robert is 52 years old with decades of professional and care experience\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And community_elohim coordinates community care economy\n    And Robert has accumulated substantial care contributions and social capital\n\n  Scenario: Community leadership positions recognize accumulated care experience\n    Given Robert has decades of care economy participation\n    And he has demonstrated capability through managing complex responsibilities\n    And community needs experienced leadership\n    When community_elohim identifies leadership opportunities\n    Then it should recognize Robert's accumulated care contributions as leadership qualification\n    And surface opportunities: community boards, policy advisory roles, initiative leadership\n    And connect his care experience to governance credibility\n    And help him understand that his lived experience is valuable wisdom\n    And match leadership opportunities to his capacity and interests\n    And prevent exploitation of middle-aged adults' sense of responsibility\n    And support meaningful community contribution without burnout\n\n  Scenario: Community care policy advocacy informed by personal experience\n    Given Robert manages multigenerational care and work-life balance\n    And he's learned what community systems help and what fails\n    And policy could be improved based on his experience\n    When community_elohim connects him to policy advocacy\n    Then it should surface opportunities to influence care economy policy\n    And help him translate personal experience into policy recommendations\n    And connect him to boards, councils, and advocacy organizations\n    And recognize that his voice matters because he's lived the complexity\n    And support him in advocating for elder care resources, work-family policies, and care infrastructure\n    And channel his accumulated wisdom toward system improvement\n    And demonstrate that care economy includes policy transformation\n\n  Scenario: Mentoring younger adults in care economy navigation\n    Given Robert has learned to navigate work-care balance over decades\n    And younger adults are earlier in their journey\n    And his experience could help others avoid struggles\n    When community_elohim coordinates mentoring\n    Then it should connect Robert with younger adults seeking guidance\n    And recognize his mentoring as valuable care contribution\n    And support him in sharing knowledge about care economy practices\n    And help younger generation learn from his experience\n    And value his mentoring in community care tokens\n    And prevent him from being exploited for free emotional labor\n    And build intergenerational knowledge transfer\n\n  Scenario: Community resource coordination supports multigenerational care\n    Given Robert coordinates care across multiple generations\n    And community resources exist but are hard to navigate\n    And he needs eldercare support, young adult resources, and family services\n    When community_elohim coordinates resources\n    Then it should connect Robert to relevant community support services\n    And surface eldercare programs for his parents\n    And identify young adult support programs for his children\n    And connect him to caregiver support groups\n    And reduce time spent researching and coordinating resources\n    And demonstrate that community infrastructure should serve caregivers\n    And make visible the resources built through care economy\n\n  Scenario: Community governance voice weighted by care contributions\n    Given Robert has made substantial care contributions over decades\n    And his care work demonstrates community investment\n    When community_elohim supports governance participation\n    Then his accumulated care contributions should give him standing\n    And his voice in community decisions should reflect his investment\n    And governance processes should actively solicit his input\n    And his experience managing complexity should be valued in community planning\n    And care tokens should connect to community governance participation\n    And demonstrate that care economy participation creates civic voice\n    And prevent governance dominated by those without care experience\n\n  Scenario: Community care economy education delivered by experienced practitioners\n    Given Robert has decades of care economy participation\n    And many community members don't understand care economy principles\n    And his experience makes him credible educator\n    When community_elohim identifies education opportunities\n    Then it should connect Robert to community education initiatives\n    And recognize him as qualified to teach care economy practices\n    And support him in leading workshops, presentations, or courses\n    And value his teaching as community care contribution\n    And help community members learn from practitioners, not just theorists\n    And build community care economy literacy through peer education\n    And demonstrate that care economy spreads through experienced advocates\n\n  Scenario: Community networks provide backup support for care crises\n    Given Robert manages complex care demands that could face crisis\n    And care crises happen: parent hospitalization, child emergency, personal illness\n    And community networks could provide emergency support\n    When community_elohim builds crisis resilience\n    Then it should connect Robert to community members who could help in crisis\n    And identify backup support for his various care responsibilities\n    And ensure he's not isolated when crisis hits\n    And recognize that his care contributions create reciprocal crisis support\n    And build community resilience through mutual aid networks\n    And demonstrate that care economy participation provides safety net\n    And prevent care crisis from becoming catastrophic\n\n  Scenario: Community care infrastructure advocacy based on user needs\n    Given Robert uses community care services and sees gaps\n    And he understands what infrastructure would help families like his\n    And community planning should be informed by user experience\n    When community_elohim connects user experience to infrastructure planning\n    Then it should channel Robert's feedback to community planning processes\n    And surface gaps: \"No adult day care available for aging parents in this community\"\n    And help him advocate for infrastructure that serves caregivers\n    And connect his voice to community decision-makers\n    And ensure community care systems are designed by those who use them\n    And build care infrastructure based on actual caregiver needs\n    And demonstrate that users should shape systems\n\n  Scenario: Community leadership balanced with existing care demands\n    Given Robert has capacity for community contribution\n    And community leadership opportunities are abundant\n    And he also carries substantial family and work responsibilities\n    When community_elohim coordinates his community participation\n    Then it should help him balance community leadership with other demands\n    And prevent over-commitment that would overwhelm him\n    And surface when community demands exceed healthy boundaries\n    And support him in choosing leadership roles that match his capacity\n    And recognize that sustainable participation requires limits\n    And prevent community from exploiting his sense of responsibility\n    And support meaningful contribution without burnout\n\n  Scenario: Community care economy connects personal and collective transformation\n    Given Robert participates in care economy personally\n    And his position enables him to influence broader systems\n    And personal and systemic change reinforce each other\n    When community_elohim supports his participation\n    Then it should help him see connections between personal care and system change\n    And surface opportunities to advocate professionally for care economy principles\n    And support him in spreading care economy through his networks\n    And recognize that his generation can drive mainstream adoption\n    And help him leverage professional, economic, and political position\n    And build movement for care economy transformation\n    And demonstrate that personal practice and systemic advocacy work together\n\n  Scenario: Community intergenerational connection facilitated by middle-aged bridge\n    Given Robert connects to multiple generations: children, peers, parents\n    And he understands needs and perspectives across age ranges\n    And community thrives through intergenerational connection\n    When community_elohim leverages his intergenerational position\n    Then it should recognize him as bridge between generations\n    And support him in facilitating intergenerational community programs\n    And help younger and older community members connect through him\n    And value his translation between generational perspectives\n    And build community cohesion through intergenerational care\n    And demonstrate that middle-aged adults uniquely enable community integration\n    And strengthen community through lifecycle diversity\n\n  Scenario: Community participation builds resources for Robert's own aging\n    Given Robert is preparing for his own eventual care needs\n    And community participation now builds networks for later\n    And care economy operates on long-term reciprocity\n    When community_elohim helps Robert plan for aging\n    Then it should help him see that current community participation builds future support\n    And recognize that relationships now will remain as he ages\n    And surface how care tokens accumulate toward future care\n    And support him in building community that will serve his aging\n    And demonstrate that care economy investment pays forward\n    And help him prepare for aging with dignity through community connection\n    And recognize that community care is lifecycle reciprocity\n",
