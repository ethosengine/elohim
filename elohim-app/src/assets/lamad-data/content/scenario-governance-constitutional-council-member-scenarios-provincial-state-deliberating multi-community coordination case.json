  "content": "Scenario: Deliberating multi-community coordination case\n    Given an appeal involves agent decisions across several communities\n    And different communities have conflicting local calibrations\n    When our regional council reviews the inter-community conflict\n    Then we evaluate: how subsidiarity applies across boundaries\n    And we examine: if regional coordination is constitutionally required\n    And we consider: if local diversity should be harmonized or preserved\n    And we consult: community leaders about local context\n    And we establish: regional minimums while respecting variation\n    And we create: precedent for multi-layer governance coherence\n    And our judgment: enables communities to coordinate democratically\n",
