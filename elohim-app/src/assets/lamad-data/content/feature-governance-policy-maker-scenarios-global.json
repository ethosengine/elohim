Global-Level Policy Making for AI Governance\n  As a policy_maker in the governance system\n  Operating at the global governance layer\n  I want to participate in international AI governance frameworks\n  So that democratic governance can flourish globally and resist authoritarian capture\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the policy_maker user is registered in the system\n    And the global governance context is active\n    And Senator Elena Ruiz participates in international governance forums\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for protocol sovereignty in international forums\n    Given international organizations discuss AI regulation\n    And some proposals would mandate centralization\n    When I advocate for democratic governance principles\n    Then I argue: governments shouldn't mandate protocol architecture\n    And I promote: community sovereignty as democratic principle\n    And I defend: right of communities to adopt or reject protocol\n    And I present: evidence that protocol sovereignty works\n    And I resist: international regulation enabling authoritarian capture\n    And I build: coalition of democratic nations supporting autonomy\n    And I protect: space for democratic AI governance globally\n\n  Scenario: Participating in UN discussions on AI governance standards\n    Given United Nations addresses global AI governance\n    And standards will affect billions of people\n    When I represent my nation in UN deliberations\n    Then I share: experience with protocol in my country\n    And I advocate: for constitutional minimums as global standard\n    And I present: evidence about sortition governance effectiveness\n    And I promote: transparency and recourse as universal requirements\n    And I resist: standards that advantage authoritarian control\n    And I support: interoperability enabling coordination\n    And I work: toward global framework respecting diversity\n\n  Scenario: Opposing trade agreements compromising protocol sovereignty\n    Given trade negotiations may include digital governance provisions\n    And some proposals would restrict community autonomy\n    When I evaluate trade agreement implications\n    Then I identify: provisions threatening protocol sovereignty\n    And I oppose: requirements mandating centralization or backdoors\n    And I insist: on preserving community choice\n    And I coalition: with other nations defending autonomy\n    And I use: evidence showing protocol benefits economic wellbeing\n    And I resist: regulatory arbitrage through trade agreements\n    And I protect: democratic governance from corporate capture via trade\n\n  Scenario: Supporting protocol adoption in Global South nations\n    Given developing nations need technology transfer and support\n    And protocol shouldn't be Global North privilege\n    When I advocate for international development support\n    Then I promote: funding for Global South protocol infrastructure\n    And I support: technology transfer and capacity building\n    And I resist: digital colonialism disguised as development\n    And I ensure: Global South communities control their adoption\n    And I fund: mutual aid between wealthy and poor communities\n    And I work: toward global equity in democratic AI governance\n    And I recognize: that justice requires reducing inequality\n\n  Scenario: Learning from diverse national approaches to protocol\n    Given different nations implemented protocol differently\n    And cultural context shapes governance outcomes\n    When I study international variations in implementation\n    Then I learn: from collectivist societies' community emphasis\n    And I examine: how different political systems integrate protocol\n    And I identify: universal patterns vs context-specific adaptations\n    And I share: lessons with other policy makers\n    And I adapt: my legislation based on international evidence\n    And I contribute: to global learning community\n    And I practice: epistemic humility about cultural diversity\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating response to authoritarian threats to protocol\n    Given authoritarian regimes may attack protocol infrastructure\n    And democratic nations must respond collectively\n    When I participate in democratic coalition\n    Then we share: threat intelligence and defensive strategies\n    And we coordinate: mutual support for communities under threat\n    And we establish: sanctuary systems for protocol refugees\n    And we resist: authoritarian pressure through solidarity\n    And we provide: resources for communities defending sovereignty\n    And we demonstrate: that democracy protects itself\n    And we show: authoritarian capture is not inevitable\n\n  Scenario: Addressing global inequality in protocol access\n    Given research shows protocol adoption correlates with national wealth\n    And poor nations lack infrastructure for implementation\n    When I advocate for global equity in access\n    Then I promote: international funding mechanisms\n    And I support: technology transfer without strings attached\n    And I push: for open source hardware and software\n    And I challenge: intellectual property barriers to adoption\n    And I ensure: protocol doesn't exacerbate global inequality\n    And I work: for democratic AI governance as universal right\n    And I recognize: justice requires addressing structural barriers\n\n  Scenario: Participating in global constitutional convention as observer\n    Given Global Constitutional Convention convenes with 10,000 delegates\n    And I attend as policy maker observer not delegate\n    When I observe global deliberative democracy\n    Then I learn: from how diverse humanity deliberates together\n    And I see: what enables agreement despite profound disagreement\n    And I witness: ordinary citizens governing existential questions\n    And I prepare: to implement constitutional amendments in my nation\n    And I translate: global constitutional evolution into national law\n    And I am humbled: by wisdom of randomly-selected citizens\n    And I understand: my role as servant of democratic will\n\n  Scenario: Crafting legislation enabling global constitutional amendments\n    Given Global Convention passed ecological standing amendment\n    And national law must operationalize this\n    When I translate constitutional evolution into legislation\n    Then I grant: legal personhood to ecosystems as constitution requires\n    And I update: property law to reflect ecological rights\n    And I modify: administrative procedure for ecosystem representation\n    And I ensure: national law aligns with global constitutional principle\n    And I demonstrate: how global and national governance coordinate\n    And I serve: democratic constitutional evolution\n    And I show: policy making as implementing citizen wisdom\n\n  Scenario: Building international coalition resisting corporate capture\n    Given corporations lobby internationally for favorable regulation\n    And they use different nations to triangulate pressure\n    When I coordinate with international policy maker allies\n    Then we share: intelligence about lobbying tactics\n    And we coordinate: resistance to capture attempts\n    And we establish: transparency requirements for global lobbying\n    And we support: each other under corporate pressure\n    And we create: race-to-top rather than race-to-bottom\n    And we demonstrate: democratic solidarity across nations\n    And we protect: protocol sovereignty through collective action\n\n  Scenario: Addressing existential AI risk through democratic governance\n    Given superintelligent AI poses existential threat\n    And democratic oversight might mitigate this risk\n    When I participate in global existential risk discussions\n    Then I argue: constitutional accountability reduces AI risk\n    And I present: evidence that sortition prevents elite capture\n    And I promote: transparency enabling global democratic oversight\n    And I support: recourse mechanisms providing adaptation\n    And I advocate: for protocol's distributed architecture increasing resilience\n    And I acknowledge: uncertainties about whether this suffices\n    And I work: toward governance frameworks for humanity's survival\n\n  Scenario: Promoting research on global AI governance effectiveness\n    Given we need evidence about what works across contexts\n    And global patterns require global research\n    When I support international research infrastructure\n    Then I fund: global research networks\n    And I promote: data sharing with privacy protection\n    And I support: global South researchers leading local studies\n    And I ensure: open access to findings\n    And I enable: cumulative knowledge building\n    And I use: evidence for global policy advocacy\n    And I demonstrate: policy making based on science not ideology\n\n  Scenario: My national experience informs global AI governance norms\n    Given my nation has years of protocol experience\n    And other nations learn from our successes and failures\n    When I share our experience in global forums\n    Then I provide: honest assessment of what worked\n    And I acknowledge: mistakes and challenges\n    And I share: legislative approaches that helped\n    And I describe: how we resisted capture\n    And I explain: how communities maintained sovereignty\n    And my testimony: informs global democratic governance development\n    And national experience: contributes to global wisdom\n",
