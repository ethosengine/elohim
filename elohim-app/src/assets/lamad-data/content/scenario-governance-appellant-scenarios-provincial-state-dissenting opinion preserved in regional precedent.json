  "content": "Scenario: Dissenting opinion preserved in regional precedent\n    Given Regional Constitutional Council deliberates my appeal\n    And the council reaches majority decision but some members disagree\n    When the precedent is documented\n    Then dissenting opinions are included with their reasoning\n    And The dissent explains alternative constitutional interpretation\n    And Future councils can reference both majority and dissent\n    And Constitutional evolution can draw on minority wisdom later\n    And My appeal generates rich constitutional dialogue not just single answer\n    And Disagreement is honored as part of democratic deliberation\n",
