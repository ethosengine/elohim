  "content": "Scenario: Home health aide coordination respects household authority\n    Given Helen receives visits from home health aides\n    And multiple aides may rotate through her schedule\n    When aides enter Helen's household\n    Then Helen should remain the authority in her space\n    And her household_elohim should communicate her preferences to aides\n    And aides should be briefed on Helen's routines and wishes\n    And consistency should be maintained across different workers\n    And Helen should not have to repeatedly assert her preferences\n    And care should be provided on her terms in her space\n    And the protocol should establish Helen's household sovereignty\n",
