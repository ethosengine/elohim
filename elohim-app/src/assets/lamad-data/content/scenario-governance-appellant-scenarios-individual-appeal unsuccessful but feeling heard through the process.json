  "content": "Scenario: Appeal unsuccessful but feeling heard through the process\n    Given I filed an appeal about a life-saving intervention I felt was invasive\n    And the Constitutional Council has deliberated on my case\n    When the council affirms the agent's decision as constitutionally aligned\n    But also recommends protocol enhancements for pre-specified preferences\n    Then I receive detailed explanation of why the decision was upheld\n    And I can see how my appeal influenced protocol improvements\n    And I am offered support to update my future preferences\n    And My dissent is honored and recorded even though I didn't win\n    And I understand my voice mattered in making the system better\n",
