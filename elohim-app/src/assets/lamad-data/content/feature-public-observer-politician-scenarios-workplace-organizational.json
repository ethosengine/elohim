Labor and Economic Development Policy Governance for Elected Representative\n  As a politician in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer\n  I want to make informed labor and economic policy decisions\n  So that I can balance worker wellbeing with economic development and resist capture by business interests\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the politician user is registered in the system\n    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Politician understands worker constituent economic conditions\n    Given the politician represents working-class district\n    And hears business community claim workers are thriving\n    When the Observer analyzes local economic and wage patterns\n    Then they see median wages insufficient for local housing costs\n    And identify workers holding multiple jobs to survive\n    And understand constituent economic stress beyond unemployment numbers\n    And learn which industries pay poverty wages requiring public assistance\n    And champion worker-centered economic policy with evidence\n\n  Scenario: Politician evaluates economic development subsidy proposal with accountability\n    Given corporation seeks tax breaks for promised job creation\n    And presents rosy projections of economic benefits\n    When the Observer analyzes company track record and subsidy impacts\n    Then they see company's job creation performance in other jurisdictions\n    And understand actual jobs created versus promised in past subsidies\n    And calculate public cost per job versus wage quality\n    And identify whether subsidized jobs pay living wages or require public assistance\n    And demand accountability provisions in economic development deals\n\n  Scenario: Politician tracks accountability for job creation commitments\n    Given the politician approved tax incentives for business expansion\n    And company promised specific job creation and wage levels\n    When the Observer monitors economic development outcomes\n    Then they see actual jobs created versus commitments\n    And track whether wages meet promised levels\n    And identify whether company hires local workers versus imports\n    And receive alerts when company fails to meet obligations\n    And enforce accountability provisions or recapture subsidies\n\n  Scenario: Politician surfaces worker priorities beyond business lobby\n    Given the politician hears from business groups on labor policy\n    But limited direct contact with worker constituents\n    When the Observer aggregates worker constituent input\n    Then they see workers prioritize healthcare access and paid sick leave\n    And identify childcare costs as barrier to workforce participation\n    And understand workplace safety concerns in specific industries\n    And learn wage theft affects significant worker population\n    And align labor policy with worker constituent needs\n\n  Scenario: Politician evaluates living wage proposal with comprehensive impact analysis\n    Given business lobby claims living wage ordinance will destroy jobs\n    And worker advocates demand wage increase\n    When the Observer provides evidence-based wage policy analysis\n    Then they see living wage outcomes in comparable jurisdictions\n    And understand actual employment impacts versus predicted job losses\n    And identify public cost savings from reduced need for assistance programs\n    And review worker quality of life improvements from wage increases\n    And make informed decision beyond ideological claims\n\n  Scenario: Politician builds coalition for worker protection legislation\n    Given the politician champions paid sick leave requirement\n    And needs support from diverse constituencies\n    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities\n    Then they see public health advocates support disease prevention\n    And identify parent groups concerned about sick children and work\n    And connect with faith communities serving working families\n    And facilitate coalition across worker rights and community health interests\n    And build broad-based support for worker protections\n\n  Scenario: Politician exposes corporate wage theft patterns requiring enforcement\n    Given worker advocates report systematic wage theft\n    And enforcement resources are limited\n    When the Observer analyzes wage and hour violations\n    Then they see violation patterns by industry and employer\n    And identify employers with repeated wage theft violations\n    And understand which worker populations most affected\n    And calculate economic impact of wage theft on working families\n    And demand enforcement resources targeting systematic violators\n\n  Scenario: Politician distinguishes business lobbying from small business reality\n    Given corporate lobbying claims to represent small business\n    And uses small business owners in advocacy campaigns\n    When the Observer analyzes business community diversity\n    Then they see large corporations drive policy positions\n    And identify actual small business priorities differ from lobbying\n    And understand small businesses harmed by corporate subsidies\n    And distinguish authentic small business concerns from corporate manipulation\n    And align economic policy with diverse business community\n\n  Scenario: Politician evaluates workplace safety regulations with evidence\n    Given business lobby opposes workplace safety regulations\n    And claims compliance costs will harm competitiveness\n    When the Observer analyzes workplace safety data and regulatory impacts\n    Then they see injury and fatality rates in regulated versus unregulated contexts\n    And understand compliance costs versus worker compensation and healthcare costs\n    And identify which safety regulations most effectively prevent harm\n    And review enforcement patterns and violation rates\n    And make evidence-based decisions prioritizing worker safety\n\n  Scenario: Politician navigates union relations with constituent worker focus\n    Given the politician receives support from labor unions\n    And business groups warn against union influence\n    When the Observer provides balanced labor relations analysis\n    Then they see how unionization affects worker wages and conditions\n    And understand union priorities versus broader worker constituent needs\n    And identify where union advocacy aligns with constituent interests\n    And review economic impacts of unionization across industries\n    And navigate union relations focused on worker constituent wellbeing\n\n  Scenario: Politician monitors municipal employment practices as major employer\n    Given the politician has authority over city or state employment\n    And serves as model employer in jurisdiction\n    When the Observer analyzes public sector employment patterns\n    Then they see whether public wages meet living wage standards\n    And identify disparities in public sector compensation by role\n    And understand whether public employment offers quality jobs\n    And learn contractor and subcontractor wage and labor practices\n    And ensure public sector models worker-centered employment practices\n",
