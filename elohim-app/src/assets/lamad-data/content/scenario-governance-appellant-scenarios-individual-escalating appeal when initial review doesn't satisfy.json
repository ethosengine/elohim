  "content": "Scenario: Escalating appeal when initial review doesn't satisfy\n    Given my Community Elohim review upheld the original decision\n    And I still believe my constitutional rights were violated\n    When I choose to escalate to peer agent review\n    Then three randomly-selected Family Elohim agents from other families review my case\n    And A Constitutional Council observer monitors the peer review\n    And The peer agents investigate deeper than the original review\n    And They can override, modify, or affirm the original decision\n    And I receive their judgment within one week\n    And I retain the right to escalate further to Constitutional Council if needed\n",
