  "content": "Scenario: Identifying technical error that strengthens appellant's case\n    Given I audit agent reasoning for appeal\n    And I discover genuine technical mistake (like Wisconsin address confusion)\n    When I report the error to Constitutional Council\n    Then I explain: clearly what went wrong\n    And I assess: impact on the decision\n    And I recommend: whether decision should be overturned\n    And I serve: truth-telling over defending agents\n    And I strengthen: appellant's case when agent erred\n    And I demonstrate: that technical oversight is genuine\n    And my independence: makes expertise credible\n",
