  "content": "Scenario: Developer faces accountability for school impact promises\n    Given a developer claimed previous project would \"support local schools\"\n    And implied tax revenue would benefit education\n    When the Observer tracks actual school impacts\n    Then analysis shows: enrollment increased 120 students\n    And district had to add 6 portable classrooms\n    And property tax revenue was $400K but school costs were $900K annually\n    And promised \"school support\" was marketing not actual benefit\n    And accountability creates pressure for honest impact assessment\n",
