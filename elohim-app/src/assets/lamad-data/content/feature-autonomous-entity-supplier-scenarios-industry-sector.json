Democratic Food System Supply Chain Transformation\n  As a supplier in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the industry_sector governance layer\n  I want to participate in democratizing entire food supply chain\n  So that extraction is replaced by fair value distribution from farm to table\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Johnson Farm supplies EAE democratic food service network\n    And the industry_sector governance context is active\n    And food system transformation requires supply chain coordination\n\n  Scenario: Direct farmer-to-restaurant relationships replace corporate distributor extraction\n    Given corporate distributors (Sysco, US Foods) extract 400-500% markup between farmer and restaurant\n    And Tom received $0.50/lb for tomatoes distributors sold for $2.50/lb\n    When EAE network enables direct relationships\n    Then Tom receives $1.50/lb for tomatoes (3x previous payment)\n    And restaurants pay $2.00/lb (20% less than through distributor)\n    And both parties benefit massively by eliminating extractive middleman\n    And corporate distributor extraction is replaced by transparent partnership\n    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates direct supply relationships across network\n\n  Scenario: Democratic supply chain coordination provides volume purchasing power\n    Given individual farms and restaurants lack negotiating leverage with suppliers\n    And corporate chains use volume to extract favorable pricing\n    When democratic network coordinates purchasing across multiple entities\n    Then farmers coordinate to provide consistent supply achieving volume benefits\n    And restaurants coordinate orders achieving volume purchasing power\n    And democratic coordination provides efficiency without extraction\n    And small democratic entities match corporate scale through cooperation\n    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates coordinated purchasing and supply planning\n\n  Scenario: Seasonal supply coordination enables year-round democratic food service\n    Given individual farms have limited seasonal production windows\n    And restaurants need year-round supply but faced corporate distribution dependence\n    When democratic farms coordinate across climate zones and seasons\n    Then network provides diverse year-round supply through farmer coordination\n    And restaurants adapt menus to seasonal availability reducing waste\n    And farmers specialize in crops suited to their land and climate\n    And seasonal coordination provides reliability without standardization\n    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates seasonal supply across bioregional network\n\n  Scenario: Supply chain transparency from farm to table builds trust and accountability\n    Given corporate food system is opaque making accountability impossible\n    And customers and workers don't know where food comes from or how people were treated\n    When democratic supply chain implements radical transparency\n    Then customers trace food from specific farm (Johnson Farm tomatoes) to their plate\n    And farming practices (organic, regenerative) are documented and visible\n    And farmworker wages and conditions are transparent\n    And value distribution is clear showing fair compensation throughout chain\n    And industry_sector_elohim provides supply chain transparency platform\n\n  Scenario: Democratic food system challenges corporate distributor business model\n    Given corporate distributors depend on opacity and extraction for profit\n    And their value proposition (convenience, consistency) doesn't justify 400% markup\n    When democratic network demonstrates distribution without extraction\n    Then corporate distributors face competitive threat from transparent alternative\n    And necessary distribution functions (logistics, aggregation) are provided at cost-recovery pricing\n    And extractive markup is proven unnecessary for functioning supply chain\n    And food industry learns distribution can be democratic cooperative, not profit-maximizing corporation\n    And industry_sector_elohim documents cost comparison between extractive and democratic distribution\n\n  Scenario: Farmer cooperation replaces competition through democratic coordination\n    Given farmers traditionally compete for corporate contracts driving prices down\n    And competition prevented coordination benefiting all farmers\n    When democratic network enables farmer cooperation\n    Then Tom and neighboring farms coordinate complementary production\n    And crop specialization (one farm tomatoes, another greens, another roots) provides diversity\n    And revenue is shared fairly based on contribution\n    And farmers share equipment, labor, and expertise\n    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates farmer network coordination and fair value distribution\n\n  Scenario: Sustainable agriculture becomes economically viable through fair pricing\n    Given corporate food system makes sustainable farming nearly impossible financially\n    And Tom wanted to practice regenerative agriculture but margins were too thin\n    When democratic network pays premium for sustainable practices\n    Then organic and regenerative farming become profitable, not costly burden\n    And environmental stewardship is valued through higher prices, not punished through market\n    And sustainable practices spread as economic viability is proven\n    And food system transformation includes ecological regeneration\n    And industry_sector_elohim tracks sustainability premium impacts on farming practices\n\n  Scenario: Food service workers and farmworkers build solidarity across supply chain\n    Given workers in restaurants and farms were isolated from each other\n    And corporate structure prevented relationship building across supply chain\n    When democratic network connects food workers and farmworkers\n    Then Emma (restaurant worker) and Tom's farmworkers coordinate directly\n    And workers across supply chain recognize shared interests and values\n    And solidarity builds between urban food service and rural agriculture\n    And cross-training opportunities enable workers to learn full food system\n    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates worker connections across supply chain\n\n  Scenario: Democratic distribution cooperative emerges providing logistics without extraction\n    Given some distribution infrastructure is useful (aggregation, transportation, storage)\n    And corporate distributors provide this but extract massively beyond cost\n    When democratic network creates worker-owned distribution cooperative\n    Then logistics services are provided at cost-recovery, not profit maximization\n    And distribution workers gain ownership and democratic governance\n    And necessary functions are preserved without extraction\n    And democratic cooperative proves distribution infrastructure can be democratically operated\n    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates democratic distribution cooperative development\n\n  Scenario: Quality standards improve through democratic supply chain accountability\n    Given corporate food system often degrades quality for profit maximization\n    And quality claims are marketing, not enforceable accountability\n    When democratic supply chain implements transparent quality documentation\n    Then farming practices are witnessed and documented (soil health, pest management, harvest quality)\n    And restaurant food preparation is transparent to customers\n    And quality accountability flows throughout chain\n    And standards continuously improve through democratic feedback and learning\n    And industry_sector_elohim manages quality documentation and accountability systems\n\n  Scenario: Food system workforce development includes democratic governance training\n    Given food service and agriculture training focuses on technical skills only\n    And democratic enterprises need workers skilled in collaboration and governance\n    When industry sector develops democratic food system training programs\n    Then workers learn technical skills (cooking, cultivation) plus democratic governance\n    And training includes cooperative business, facilitation, and consensus decision-making\n    And educational institutions incorporate democratic food system curriculum\n    And workforce is prepared for democratic enterprise participation\n    And industry_sector_elohim develops training curriculum and coordinates educational partnerships\n\n  Scenario: Democratic food system becomes recognized industry sector alternative\n    Given food industry is dominated by corporate extraction model\n    And alternative models are marginalized as niche or idealistic\n    When democratic food network reaches scale and proves viability\n    Then \"democratic food system\" becomes recognized industry category\n    And industry conferences, publications, and research treat it as serious alternative\n    And investment flows toward democratic food enterprises\n    And policy makers design regulations supporting democratic food system\n    And industry_sector_elohim advocates for democratic food system recognition and support\n",
