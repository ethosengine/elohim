  "content": "Scenario: Research on superintelligence governance and democratic legitimacy\n    Given my most important research question is existential\n    And I study whether sortition can govern superintelligent agents\n    When I analyze Constitutional Council confidence over time as agents advance\n    Then I measure: council member certainty declining as agent capability increases\n    And I document: increasing expert influence as complexity exceeds lay understanding\n    And I identify: warning signs of democratic theater masking technocratic rule\n    And I also find: hopeful pattern of councils resisting capture and demanding explainability\n    And I assess: whether democratic oversight of superintelligence is possible\n    And I conclude: honestly that question remains open\n    And My research frames: humanity's most important governance challenge with intellectual honesty\n",
