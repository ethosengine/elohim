Community Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent\n  As a retired grandparent with time and skills to contribute\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want my community care contributions to be recognized and valued\n  So that retirement is experienced as liberation for community service\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the grandparent user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret is 68, retired from nursing\n    And Margaret volunteers in community beyond family care\n    And Margaret has professional skills and life experience to contribute\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates community care economy\n\n  Scenario: Volunteer work recognized as valuable care economy contribution\n    Given Margaret volunteers 10 hours/week in community\n    And she serves at food bank, library, or community health clinic\n    When the community_elohim tracks volunteer contributions\n    Then it should quantify Margaret's volunteer hours\n    And it should calculate economic value of her skilled labor\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for community service\n    And volunteer work should be recognized as substantial contribution\n    And Margaret should see herself as productive community member\n    And retirement should be liberation for care work, not obsolescence\n    And community should value and appreciate her service\n\n  Scenario: Professional nursing skills contribute to community health\n    Given Margaret is a retired nurse with valuable expertise\n    And community health initiatives need skilled volunteers\n    When Margaret provides health education or clinic support\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize her professional skills\n    And it should value skilled labor more highly than unskilled\n    And her nursing background should be leveraged for community benefit\n    And professional retirees should be seen as community resources\n    And Margaret's expertise should serve community health\n    And skilled volunteering should accumulate significant care tokens\n\n  Scenario: Mentoring younger community members and professionals\n    Given Margaret has decades of nursing experience and life wisdom\n    And younger professionals and community members can learn from her\n    When Margaret mentors or teaches in community\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize mentoring as care work\n    And it should value intergenerational knowledge transmission\n    And it should connect Margaret with mentoring opportunities\n    And her wisdom and experience should benefit next generation\n    And mentoring should accumulate care tokens\n    And community should benefit from elder mentorship\n\n  Scenario: Serving on community boards and governance bodies\n    Given Margaret has time, experience, and judgment to contribute\n    And community boards need skilled, committed members\n    When Margaret serves on nonprofit boards or advisory committees\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize governance work\n    And it should value her time and expertise in decision-making\n    And it should track her board service as care contribution\n    And governance participation should accumulate care tokens\n    And community should benefit from her wisdom and service\n    And retired elders should be valued in community leadership\n\n  Scenario: Building community care networks across generations\n    Given Margaret connects with community members of all ages\n    And she participates in various community activities\n    When the community_elohim tracks social capital building\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's role in community connection\n    And it should value relationship-building as care work\n    And it should show how her connections strengthen community resilience\n    And intergenerational community building should be recognized\n    And Margaret should help create inclusive, connected community\n    And social capital creation should accumulate care tokens\n\n  Scenario: Teaching and sharing skills in community education\n    Given Margaret has skills in health, crafts, traditional knowledge\n    And community members want to learn these skills\n    When Margaret teaches classes or workshops\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize teaching as care work\n    And it should facilitate skill-sharing opportunities\n    And it should connect Margaret with learners\n    And community education should be valued and supported\n    And Margaret's teaching should accumulate care tokens\n    And community should benefit from skill transmission\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating community care during crises or emergencies\n    Given Margaret has nursing skills and disaster response experience\n    And community needs coordinated care during emergencies\n    When community crisis or emergency occurs\n    Then the community_elohim should help coordinate response\n    And Margaret's skills should be mobilized appropriately\n    And her crisis care should be specially recognized and valued\n    And community should benefit from retired professionals' expertise\n    And emergency care contributions should accumulate significant tokens\n    And community resilience should be strengthened by elder participation\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for elder-friendly community policies\n    Given Margaret represents retired community members' interests\n    And community policies affect elder well-being and participation\n    When community considers policies on housing, transportation, or services\n    Then Margaret's voice and advocacy should be valued\n    And her care contributions should give her standing in decisions\n    And elder perspective should inform community planning\n    And age-friendly policies should be prioritized\n    And community should serve members of all ages\n    And Margaret should help shape community for aging population\n\n  Scenario: Connecting community care with family care responsibilities\n    Given Margaret provides both family care and community service\n    And these responsibilities must be balanced\n    When the community_elohim tracks Margaret's total contributions\n    Then it should recognize both family and community care\n    And it should help Margaret balance multiple care obligations\n    And it should ensure community service is sustainable alongside family care\n    And total care burden should be visible and manageable\n    And Margaret should be able to contribute without burnout\n    And community should respect her family care commitments\n\n  Scenario: Care economy capital accumulation for community standing\n    Given Margaret makes substantial community contributions\n    And accumulated care tokens represent community standing\n    When community decisions are made about resources or priorities\n    Then Margaret's care contributions should give her voice\n    And care economy should inform community governance\n    And those who contribute care should have standing in decisions\n    And community should operate on care economy principles\n    And Margaret's service should be recognized in community leadership\n    And care-based governance should be operational\n\n  Scenario: Organizing and coordinating community care initiatives\n    Given Margaret has organizational skills and community connections\n    And community care initiatives need coordination\n    When Margaret helps organize mutual aid, care networks, or community programs\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize organizational labor\n    And it should value coordination work as essential care\n    And it should support Margaret in community organizing\n    And organizational leadership should accumulate care tokens\n    And community should benefit from her coordination skills\n    And care infrastructure should be built and maintained\n\n  Scenario: Building care relationships that support Margaret's own aging\n    Given Margaret is building community care networks now\n    And she will need community support as she ages\n    When the community_elohim tracks care relationship development\n    Then it should recognize Margaret is building future care security\n    And her current contributions should create community reciprocity\n    And community members she helps now will support her later\n    And community care networks should enable aging in place\n    And Margaret's care work should create long-term community integration\n    And care economy should provide retirement security beyond finances\n",
