Employment and Labor Accountability for Developer Interests\n  As a developer in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer\n  I want transparent labor practices and honest job creation accounting\n  So that responsible employment practices create competitive advantage\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the developer_interests user is registered in the system\n    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Developer receives honest job creation analysis\n    Given a developer claims project will \"create 200 jobs\"\n    And uses job creation to justify public subsidies\n    When the Observer provides independent employment impact analysis\n    Then the developer sees: 180 jobs are temporary construction jobs\n    And only 20 are permanent positions\n    And median permanent job wage is $15/hour in area with $22/hour living wage\n    And honest accounting distinguishes temporary versus permanent employment\n    And job quality matters as much as job quantity\n\n  Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates quality job creation\n    Given a responsible developer prioritizes workforce development\n    And creates genuine employment opportunities for local residents\n    When the Observer documents employment track record\n    Then analysis shows: 85% of jobs went to local residents\n    And median wage is $24/hour with benefits\n    And developer provides apprenticeship programs for construction trades\n    And permanent jobs offer career advancement opportunities\n    And quality employment becomes competitive advantage for approvals\n\n  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for labor violations\n    Given a developer has history of wage theft and safety violations\n    And now seeks public subsidies for new project\n    When the Observer surfaces labor practice track record\n    Then analysis shows: 47 wage and hour violations over five years\n    And 23 OSHA safety citations across projects\n    And pattern of worker exploitation not isolated incidents\n    And public subsidies shouldn't reward developers who exploit workers\n    And labor accountability becomes approval consideration\n\n  Scenario: Developer worker safety record affects reputation\n    Given a responsible developer maintains excellent safety practices\n    And invests in worker protection beyond minimum requirements\n    When the Observer tracks workplace safety performance\n    Then the developer shows: zero serious injuries over 8 projects\n    And safety training exceeds industry standards\n    And workers report positive working conditions\n    And safety commitment creates positive reputation with workers and community\n    And responsible practices support recruitment and retention\n\n  Scenario: Developer local hiring commitment gains enforcement\n    Given a developer promised 60% local hiring as approval condition\n    And community counted on jobs for neighborhood residents\n    When the Observer tracks hiring outcomes\n    Then analysis shows: only 22% of jobs went to local residents\n    And most workers came from outside region\n    And community that bore development impacts didn't receive promised jobs\n    And accountability creates consequences for broken employment commitments\n    And future commitments require enforceable mechanisms\n\n  Scenario: Developer union relations become transparency issue\n    Given a developer has pattern of union-busting and labor resistance\n    And claims to support workers while fighting unionization\n    When the Observer documents labor relations history\n    Then analysis shows: developer spent $400K on union-busting consultants\n    And filed NLRB complaints against worker organizing attempts\n    And rhetoric about supporting workers contradicts anti-union actions\n    And labor relations pattern becomes visible to workers and community\n    And developers face accountability for anti-worker practices\n\n  Scenario: Developer prevailing wage compliance gains monitoring\n    Given a developer receives public subsidy requiring prevailing wage\n    And claims compliance with wage requirements\n    When the Observer monitors wage compliance\n    Then analysis shows: certified payroll reports show prevailing wage\n    But worker interviews reveal unpaid overtime and deductions\n    And actual take-home pay is below prevailing wage requirements\n    And compliance on paper differs from worker reality\n    And enforcement mechanisms need worker-centered monitoring\n\n  Scenario: Responsible developer benefits from positive labor reputation\n    Given a responsible developer treats workers well consistently\n    And has track record of fair wages, safe conditions, and respect\n    When the Observer makes labor reputation visible\n    Then the developer shows: zero labor violations across 12 projects\n    And worker testimonials describe positive treatment and fair practices\n    And unions support developer's projects because of good labor relations\n    And positive labor reputation creates advantages in competitive approvals\n    And responsible employment practices strengthen business success\n\n  Scenario: Developer employment impacts on community economics\n    Given a developer's project will employ 150 construction workers\n    And claims significant economic impact on local economy\n    When the Observer analyzes actual community economic impacts\n    Then analysis shows: most workers spend earnings in home communities not locally\n    And temporary jobs create temporary spending not sustained economic benefit\n    And few local businesses benefit from construction employment\n    And honest economic analysis reveals limited community benefit\n    And employment claims need scrutiny about actual community economics\n\n  Scenario: Developer apprenticeship commitment creates lasting benefit\n    Given a responsible developer commits to workforce development\n    And partners with unions and training programs\n    When the Observer tracks workforce development outcomes\n    Then analysis shows: 35 apprentices trained across three projects\n    And 28 completed programs and gained journey-level employment\n    And investment in workforce development creates lasting community benefit\n    And genuine partnerships distinguish from token training gestures\n    And workforce development commitment creates positive legacy\n",
