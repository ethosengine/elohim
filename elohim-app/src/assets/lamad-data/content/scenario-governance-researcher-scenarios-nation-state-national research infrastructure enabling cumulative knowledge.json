  "content": "Scenario: National research infrastructure enabling cumulative knowledge\n    Given sustainable research requires ongoing data access and funding\n    And I advocate for long-term research infrastructure\n    When national research program is established with public funding\n    Then independent researchers gain: anonymized data access with privacy protection\n    And longitudinal tracking becomes: possible across decades\n    And replication and extension: of findings is enabled\n    And peer review and quality control: maintain scientific standards\n    And research independence from: protocol developers is preserved\n    And Knowledge accumulates: rather than being rediscovered each generation\n    And Democratic AI governance becomes: evidence-based rather than ideological\n",
