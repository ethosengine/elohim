  "content": "Scenario: Climate adaptation knowledge from lived experience\n    Given Margaret has observed environmental changes over decades\n    And adaptation requires long-term observation\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates climate adaptation\n    Then Margaret's observations should inform adaptation strategies\n    And her knowledge of changing patterns should be valued\n    And long-term perspective should shape bioregional planning\n    And senior experience should guide community resilience\n    And climate adaptation should benefit from elder wisdom\n    And Margaret's lifetime of observation should serve collective response\n",
