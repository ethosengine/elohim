Community-Level Constitutional Council Deliberation for Council Member\n  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want to provide democratic oversight of AI decisions through citizen deliberation\n  So that agent governance remains accountable without being controllable\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the constitutional_council_member user is registered in the system\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And Sarah Martinez is serving her 3-month term on community council\n\n  Scenario: Random selection to serve on community Constitutional Council\n    Given I am a nurse and mother living in my community\n    And I have never been politically active\n    When I receive notification of sortition selection for Constitutional Council\n    Then I am randomly selected via cryptographic sortition\n    And I am offered 3-month term serving 20 hours per week\n    And I receive compensation matching local median income\n    And I am provided childcare support and accessibility accommodations\n    And I can accept or decline without penalty\n    And Selection cannot be lobbied or manipulated\n    And My service brings ordinary citizen wisdom to AI governance\n\n  Scenario: Intensive training prepares me for constitutional interpretation\n    Given I have accepted my Constitutional Council appointment\n    And I need to understand constitutional principles to judge agent decisions\n    When I complete 3-week training program\n    Then I learn: constitutional principles and their application\n    And I study: how agents reason and make decisions\n    And I practice: deliberation protocols and consensus building\n    And I review: historical precedents and case studies\n    And I am educated: without being indoctrinated about \"correct\" answers\n    And I develop: judgment capacity not just knowledge\n    And I feel: prepared to serve despite lack of formal expertise\n\n  Scenario: Reviewing my first appeal case with fellow council members\n    Given Marcus appealed his Family Elohim's mental health intervention decision\n    And I am reviewing this case with my diverse council\n    When we deliberate on whether the agent followed constitutional bounds\n    Then I bring: my nurse perspective on mental health and care\n    And retired teacher brings: education and developmental insights\n    And construction worker brings: working-class resource constraint understanding\n    And grad student brings: research and analytical skills\n    And business owner brings: economic and practical judgment\n    And together we form: collective wisdom greater than any individual\n    And we ask: \"Did this demonstrate love as committed action?\"\n\n  Scenario: Balancing technical expert advice with my human judgment\n    Given Marcus's case involves complex pattern detection algorithms\n    And I don't understand the technical details\n    When technical expert Dr. Okonkwo explains the agent's reasoning\n    Then she translates: cryptographic proofs into accessible language\n    And she clarifies: what confidence levels mean and their limitations\n    And she acknowledges: uncertainties and competing interpretations\n    And she informs: but doesn't tell us what decision is right\n    And I weigh: her technical knowledge alongside my human wisdom\n    And I judge: whether constitutional principles were honored\n    And I respect: expertise without surrendering my judgment authority\n\n  Scenario: Deliberating with structured process ensuring all voices heard\n    Given our council has diverse perspectives that could lead to conflict\n    And we need to reach judgment together\n    When we follow deliberation protocols\n    Then all members: share initial reactions and concerns\n    And we identify: points of agreement and disagreement\n    And we examine: constitutional principles explicitly\n    And we research: relevant precedents from previous cases\n    And we consult: experts when technical questions arise\n    And we avoid: rushed judgment or groupthink\n    And we ensure: quieter members are heard not dominated\n    And we reach: decision through genuine collective deliberation\n\n  Scenario: Creating precedent that will guide future cases\n    Given our council rules on Marcus's mental health intervention appeal\n    And we affirm the agent's decision as constitutionally aligned\n    When we document our reasoning and recommendations\n    Then we explain: why privacy was balanced against care in this case\n    And we recommend: protocol enhancements for pre-specified preferences\n    And we create: precedent that future councils can reference\n    And we document: our deliberation process (anonymized)\n    And we contribute: to evolving constitutional interpretation\n    And our judgment: becomes part of public constitutional record\n    And Marcus's case: makes the protocol better for everyone\n\n  Scenario: Ruling against agent decision when constitutional bounds exceeded\n    Given I am reviewing an appeal where agent clearly overstepped\n    And the facts show the decision violated constitutional principles\n    When our council rules the agent decision unconstitutional\n    Then the decision is: immediately overturned\n    And appellant's preferences are: automatically restored\n    And the incident is: documented as error in agent's record\n    And similar interventions: require higher thresholds going forward\n    And protocol improvements are: proposed and implemented\n    And agent learns: from legitimate critique without being punished\n    And accountability works: without compromising agent autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Experiencing the weight of judgment affecting real lives\n    Given my decision will affect Marcus's mental health support\n    And I cannot hide behind procedure or defer to experts\n    When I must judge knowing uncertainty and consequences\n    Then I feel: the burden of democratic responsibility\n    And I grapple: with possibility I might be wrong\n    And I draw on: my experience as nurse who has seen suffering\n    And I consider: my role as mother navigating care and autonomy\n    And I accept: that I must judge despite uncertainty\n    And I am supported: through compensation, training, and respect\n    And I learn: what democratic participation means at deepest level\n\n  Scenario: Seeing patterns across multiple appeals inform community calibration\n    Given our council has reviewed 50 appeals over two months\n    And I notice recurring themes and tensions\n    When I observe patterns in appeal types and outcomes\n    Then I see: many adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging\n    And I notice: three business loan denials with similar criteria\n    And I identify: recurring privacy threshold concerns\n    And I share: these observations with community leader\n    And community can: consider local protocol calibration\n    And my service: informs democratic governance beyond individual cases\n    And patterns reveal: community-wide issues requiring deliberation\n\n  Scenario: Term limits protect me from capture while preserving learning\n    Given I have served my 3-month community council term\n    And I have developed constitutional literacy and deliberation skills\n    When my term ends and I return to nursing work\n    Then I cannot: serve consecutive terms or be reappointed\n    And I cannot: build career in council governance\n    And I am protected: from lobbying, corruption, or capture\n    And I carry forward: constitutional understanding into community life\n    And I remain: engaged citizen with enhanced democratic capacity\n    And my institutional knowledge: is preserved through documentation\n    And fresh perspectives: replace mine to prevent ossification\n\n  Scenario: Anonymous service when facing community controversy\n    Given I am reviewing a highly controversial local case\n    And I am concerned about community pressure or retaliation\n    When I request anonymous service protections\n    Then my identity is: revealed only to verification systems\n    And I can: serve without public knowing who I am\n    And I am protected: from intimidation or capture attempts\n    And I can: deliberate freely without fear\n    And cryptographic proofs: verify I'm legitimate member without revealing identity\n    And my judgment: maintains democratic legitimacy despite anonymity\n",
