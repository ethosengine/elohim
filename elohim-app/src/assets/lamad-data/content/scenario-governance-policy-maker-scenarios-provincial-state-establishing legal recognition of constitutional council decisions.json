  "content": "Scenario: Establishing legal recognition of Constitutional Council decisions\n    Given courts need to know how to treat council precedents\n    And government agencies must understand council authority\n    When I craft legislation recognizing council legitimacy\n    Then I establish: statutory basis for council decisions\n    And I specify: courts recognize precedents in protocol-related cases\n    And I ensure: agencies defer to council constitutional interpretation\n    And I maintain: judicial review for constitutional questions\n    And I create: legal framework for sortition governance\n    And councils gain: legitimacy within existing legal system\n    And new democratic form: integrates with traditional structures\n",
