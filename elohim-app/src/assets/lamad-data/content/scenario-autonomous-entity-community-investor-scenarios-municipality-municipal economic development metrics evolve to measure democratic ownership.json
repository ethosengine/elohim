  "content": "Scenario: Municipal economic development metrics evolve to measure democratic ownership\n    Given cities measure economic development by job quantity, not quality\n    And Patricia's investments create high-quality jobs (living wages, ownership, voice)\n    When community investors demonstrate democratic ownership benefits\n    Then municipal metrics include: worker ownership rates, wage levels, democratic governance participation\n    And economic development success is measured by community wealth-building\n    And democratic conversions score highly on quality-focused metrics\n    And policy priorities shift toward job quality through investor advocacy\n    And municipality_elohim provides democratic economy measurement framework\n",
