  "content": "Scenario: Comparing national adoption across different political systems\n    Given different nations with different political systems adopted protocol\n    And I want to understand how political context shapes implementation\n    When I conduct cross-national comparative analysis\n    Then I examine: adoption patterns in democracies vs mixed regimes\n    And I analyze: how existing institutions integrate or resist protocol\n    And I explore: whether protocol strengthens or threatens existing power structures\n    And I assess: cultural factors that predict adoption success\n    And I identify: universal patterns vs context-dependent adaptations\n    And My research tests: whether democratic AI governance is culturally specific or universal\n    And Findings inform: international adoption strategies and expectations\n",
