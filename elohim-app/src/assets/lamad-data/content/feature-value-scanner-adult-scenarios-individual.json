Individual Layer Value Recognition for Adult\n  As an adult in prime working/parenting years (ages 26-45)\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want my personal choices and care contributions to be recognized\n  So that I can maintain my own flourishing while caring for others\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the adult user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah is 34 years old\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Sarah's personal_agent is configured for complexity management\n    And Sarah is mother of Tommy (5) and Emma (8)\n    And Sarah works full-time as a teacher\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent serves as cognitive partner for overwhelming complexity\n    Given Sarah is managing multiple care contexts simultaneously\n    And Sarah is planning Tuesday evening meals\n    And she must coordinate children's developmental needs, budget, allergies, schedule, and community obligations\n    When Sarah opens the Value Scanner\n    Then her personal_agent should present integrated complexity overview\n    And the agent should surface conflicts before they become crises\n    And it should suggest solutions balancing competing needs\n    And it should track factors Sarah can't hold simultaneously\n    And Sarah should experience genuine cognitive partnership\n    And the agent should reduce mental load, not add to it\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining personal flourishing under care responsibilities\n    Given Sarah has been prioritizing everyone else's needs\n    And her personal_agent monitors her well-being patterns\n    And Sarah's nutrition, exercise, and social connection are declining\n    When two weeks pass without self-care\n    Then the personal_agent should recognize unsustainable sacrifice\n    And it should prompt \"You've prioritized everyone else's needs for two weeks\u2014what would support your flourishing?\"\n    And it should frame self-care as essential stewardship, not selfishness\n    And it should recognize that care for self enables care for others\n    And Sarah should receive support in maintaining her own capacity\n\n  Scenario: Adult exercises full autonomy over life decisions\n    Given Sarah has competing demands on her time and resources\n    And she must balance professional work, parenting, partnership, and self-care\n    When Sarah makes decisions about resource allocation\n    Then she should have complete autonomy over her choices\n    And her personal_agent should provide decision support without manipulation\n    And she should maintain full decision-making authority\n    And the protocol should serve her values, not impose external priorities\n    And her agency should be respected as a competent adult\n\n  Scenario: Recognition of invisible care labor in personal identity\n    Given Sarah performs enormous amounts of invisible care work\n    And traditional economics don't recognize meal planning, schedule management, emotional labor\n    When Sarah reviews her care contributions\n    Then the Value Scanner should make all care labor visible\n    And her personal_agent should quantify meal planning, shopping, cooking, coordination, kin-keeping\n    And care tokens should accumulate reflecting her actual contributions\n    And Sarah's self-understanding should shift from \"not working\" to \"performing essential care labor\"\n    And visibility should transform how Sarah sees herself\n\n  Scenario: Personal data privacy under adult's complete control\n    Given Sarah's care contributions generate detailed personal data\n    And this data reveals intimate patterns of her life\n    When Sarah's data is collected and stored\n    Then she must have complete control over all data sharing\n    And she should decide what partner sees, what children see, what community sees\n    And workplace should never access personal care economy data\n    And her privacy must be absolute unless she chooses to share\n    And she should manage family members' privacy while maintaining oversight of children\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent prevents burnout through proactive monitoring\n    Given Sarah is at high risk for burnout\n    And she tends to sacrifice herself unsustainably\n    When her personal_agent detects warning signs\n    Then it should watch for nutrition suffering, exercise disappearing, social connection eroding\n    And it should proactively surface help options before crisis\n    And it should connect Sarah to community support resources\n    And it should recognize that her capacity to care depends on her well-being\n    And intervention should be timely, dignified, and effective\n\n  Scenario: Adult's complex scheduling requires sophisticated coordination\n    Given Sarah manages professional schedule, children's schedules, household tasks, community commitments\n    And conflicts arise constantly\n    When Sarah plans her week\n    Then the personal_agent should integrate with calendars, school systems, work tools\n    And it should identify scheduling conflicts automatically\n    And it should suggest realistic solutions within constraints\n    And it should coordinate across family members' needs\n    And scheduling should support Sarah's effectiveness, not overwhelm her\n\n  Scenario: Personal financial management integrated with care economy\n    Given Sarah manages household finances on $65k/year combined income\n    And budgeting is complex across multiple care contexts\n    When Sarah makes purchasing decisions\n    Then her personal_agent should track budget in real-time\n    And it should integrate financial constraints with nutritional needs, developmental appropriateness, family values\n    And it should help Sarah make informed trade-offs\n    And financial tools should serve care economy goals, not just spending tracking\n    And budget management should feel supportive, not restrictive\n\n  Scenario: Adult learns to recognize and value her own care contributions\n    Given Sarah has internalized that parenting is \"not working\"\n    And society devalues the care labor she performs\n    When Sarah uses the Value Scanner over time\n    Then she should develop new understanding of her contributions\n    And she should see meal planning, emotional labor, household coordination as valuable work\n    And quantified care contributions should shift her self-concept\n    And she should gain language to articulate her care work to others\n    And cultural transformation should begin with Sarah's own understanding\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent adapts to Sarah's individual values and culture\n    Given Sarah has specific cultural background and personal values\n    And her family has chosen value frameworks\n    When the personal_agent provides guidance\n    Then it should align with Sarah's cultural context\n    And it should respect her personal value priorities\n    And it should serve her chosen framework, not impose external values\n    And diverse cultural approaches to care should be honored\n    And the protocol should be culturally adaptive, not prescriptive\n\n  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained with full data portability\n    Given Sarah has been using the Value Scanner\n    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers\n    When Sarah chooses to disconnect from the system\n    Then the system must honor disconnection immediately\n    And she should receive complete data export of all her information\n    And no manipulative retention patterns should be employed\n    And her right to not participate must be absolute\n    And data portability should enable switching to alternative systems\n\n  Scenario: Personal crisis support provides immediate dignified assistance\n    Given Sarah encounters a crisis\u2014job loss, health emergency, family breakdown\n    And she needs immediate support\n    When the personal_agent detects crisis indicators\n    Then it should connect her to appropriate resources immediately\n    And support should be dignified, not stigmatizing\n    And she should access community mutual aid networks\n    And crisis response should be effective under extreme stress\n    And the protocol should function as safety net during vulnerability\n",
