  "content": "Scenario: Neighborhood care tokens value Alex's substantial contributions\n    Given Alex contributes significantly to neighborhood care economy\n    And traditional metrics don't capture accessibility advocacy value\n    When neighborhood care tokens are calculated\n    Then Alex's barrier documentation should accumulate tokens\n    And Alex's mutual aid participation should be valued appropriately\n    And Alex's disability expertise shared with neighbors should count\n    And Alex's organizing work should generate care economy standing\n    And care tokens should position Alex as neighborhood contributor\n    And Alex should be able to access neighborhood resources based on contributions\n    And the protocol should make Alex's neighborhood value undeniable\n",
