  "content": "Scenario: Understanding workplace rights and protections as vulnerable worker\n    Given I may face workplace discrimination, harassment, or rights violations\n    And vulnerable workers are often targeted for workplace abuse\n    When I encounter workplace problems or need to understand my rights\n    Then the workplace_elohim provides information on my workplace rights\n    And helps me identify illegal workplace practices\n    And connects me to legal resources or worker advocacy organizations\n    And validates that I deserve workplace protection and dignity\n    And helps me document workplace problems\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to rights violations\n    And recognizes that vulnerable workers need extra rights awareness\n    And supports me in demanding legal workplace treatment\n",
