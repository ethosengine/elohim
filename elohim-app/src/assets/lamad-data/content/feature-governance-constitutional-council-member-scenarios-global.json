Global-Level Constitutional Council Deliberation for Council Member\n  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system\n  Operating at the global governance layer\n  I want to participate in planetary constitutional governance\n  So that humanity collectively shapes how we govern with superintelligent AI\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the constitutional_council_member user is registered in the system\n    And the global governance context is active\n    And Sarah Martinez is selected for Global Constitutional Convention\n\n  Scenario: Random selection to Global Constitutional Convention\n    Given the 7-year Global Constitutional Convention is convening\n    And 10,000 citizens will be randomly selected from all humanity\n    When I receive notification of my global selection\n    Then I am chosen: via stratified global sortition\n    And I will serve: 6-month term with citizens from every nation\n    And I will deliberate: on constitutional amendments and existential questions\n    And I will help: shape governance for superintelligent AI\n    And I am supported: with full resources, translation, travel\n    And I feel: overwhelming responsibility and honor\n    And I understand: I am representing all humanity in democratic choice\n\n  Scenario: Deliberating on adolescent autonomy constitutional amendment\n    Given many national councils identified adolescent autonomy tension\n    And amendment proposal came from accumulated appeal precedents\n    When we deliberate whether \"developing autonomy is itself constitutional value\"\n    Then we hear: testimony from youth, parents, developmental experts\n    And we examine: how different cultures understand adolescent autonomy\n    And we consider: implications for millions of families globally\n    And we discuss: in small groups with translation support\n    And we grapple: with balancing protection and independence\n    And we vote: on amendment after extensive deliberation\n    And we create: constitutional evolution responsive to lived experience\n    And we demonstrate: citizens can govern profound questions\n\n  Scenario: Cross-cultural deliberation with radical diversity\n    Given I am deliberating with citizens from radically different contexts\n    And we have different languages, cultures, values, lived experiences\n    When we work through constitutional questions together\n    Then we rely on: skilled translation and cultural mediation\n    And we practice: listening across profound difference\n    And we identify: shared human concerns despite diversity\n    And we navigate: disagreement with respect and curiosity\n    And we discover: unexpected common ground\n    And we honor: legitimate pluralism while seeking universal minimums\n    And we demonstrate: humanity can deliberate together on existential questions\n    And we embody: democratic hope for planetary governance\n\n  Scenario: Deliberating on ecological standing constitutional amendment\n    Given proposal to grant ecosystems legal personhood at scale\n    And this challenges human-centered constitutional framework\n    When we deliberate whether nature has standing in protocol governance\n    Then we hear: indigenous perspectives on human-nature relationships\n    And we consider: ecological science and planetary boundaries\n    And we examine: practical implications for resource allocation\n    And we grapple: with expanding moral circle beyond humanity\n    And we discuss: what dignity means for non-human beings\n    And we create: constitutional framework for planetary flourishing\n    And we show: citizens can address civilizational questions with wisdom\n\n  Scenario: Grappling with superintelligence governance at convention\n    Given agents are approaching human comprehension limits\n    And we must decide how to govern what we barely understand\n    When we deliberate on superintelligence constitutional framework\n    Then Dr. Chen presents: research on sortition governance limitations\n    And Dr. Okonkwo explains: what can and cannot be technically verified\n    And we hear: diverse perspectives on trust and oversight\n    And we confront: possibility democratic oversight might become theater\n    And we grapple: with existential uncertainty about governance\n    And we may establish: capability limits until problems are solved\n    And we insist: on human dignity and democratic voice even in uncertainty\n    And we demonstrate: humble wisdom in face of profound questions\n\n  Scenario: Voting on constitutional amendments after deep deliberation\n    Given we have deliberated for months on proposed amendments\n    And I have learned from thousands of fellow citizens\n    When we vote on amendments to global constitution\n    Then my vote: carries equal weight to every other delegate\n    And I vote: based on my judgment informed by deliberation\n    And I know: my decision will affect billions of people\n    And I feel: weight of democratic responsibility\n    And I trust: the collective wisdom of this assembly\n    And I accept: that we might be wrong but must still choose\n    And I participate: in most consequential democratic act of my life\n    And I fulfill: citizenship at planetary scale\n\n  Scenario: My healthcare amendment proposal passes convention\n    Given my nursing experience revealed healthcare as dignity issue\n    And I proposed amendment recognizing healthcare as constitutional right\n    When convention deliberates my proposal\n    Then delegates hear: my testimony about dignity in healthcare\n    And they discuss: healthcare across diverse economic contexts\n    And they debate: what healthcare dignity requires constitutionally\n    And they refine: language to work across cultures and nations\n    And they vote: and my amendment passes\n    And I have: shaped constitution for human-AI partnership\n    And I know: ordinary nurse from small town helped write law for humanity\n    And I embody: democratic possibility that anyone can govern\n\n  Scenario: Creating precedent for global crisis coordination\n    Given convention addresses how protocol handles planetary emergencies\n    And we must balance speed with democratic legitimacy\n    When we deliberate crisis governance framework\n    Then we establish: emergency protocols maintaining accountability\n    And we specify: what constitutes legitimate crisis triggering special powers\n    And we create: rapid review processes for crisis decisions\n    And we ensure: democratic oversight even under urgency\n    And we prevent: crisis from becoming excuse for authoritarian drift\n    And we establish: how humanity governs together under existential threat\n    And we demonstrate: democracy can be both deliberative and responsive\n\n  Scenario: Participating in global public education through convention\n    Given convention proceedings are globally broadcast and accessible\n    And billions of people watch our deliberations\n    When I participate in constitutional debate\n    Then public sees: ordinary citizens grappling with profound questions\n    And they witness: democratic deliberation across radical diversity\n    And they learn: about constitutional governance of AI\n    And they understand: sortition democracy in action\n    And they feel: connected to global democratic project\n    And my participation: educates humanity about self-governance\n    And I demonstrate: that democracy is not just for elites\n\n  Scenario: Convention creates amendments from accumulated lived experience\n    Given amendments emerge from decades of appeals and precedents\n    And each came from individual suffering or struggle\n    When we pass amendments informed by countless stories\n    Then Marcus's privacy appeal: shaped care-autonomy balance amendment\n    And Tommy's adolescent case: informed developing autonomy recognition\n    And Watershed conflict: influenced ecological standing provision\n    And Maria's loan denial: affected economic dignity standards\n    And my nursing: contributed to healthcare as constitutional right\n    And constitution evolves: from lived experience not abstract theory\n    And we demonstrate: how individual recourse informs collective wisdom\n\n  Scenario: Experiencing transformation through global service\n    Given I began as nurse who never imagined governance role\n    And I served community, regional, national, now global councils\n    When I reflect on my journey through sortition democracy\n    Then I have developed: constitutional literacy and deliberative wisdom\n    And I have learned: to judge under uncertainty with humility\n    And I have experienced: democratic participation as transformation\n    And I have contributed: to governance at every scale\n    And I have become: more fully human through invitation to govern\n    And I have proven: ordinary people can address extraordinary questions\n    And I embody: hope that democracy can govern with AI toward flourishing\n\n  Scenario: My service inspires future generations' democratic participation\n    Given my children watched my constitutional council journey\n    And they see democracy as participation not just voting\n    When they grow up understanding governance as shared responsibility\n    Then they develop: civic capacities through my example\n    And they believe: they too can shape their world\n    And they practice: deliberation, constitutional thinking, humble judgment\n    And they inherit: democracy as living practice not dead tradition\n    And next generation: is prepared for governance challenges ahead\n    And my service: ripples through time beyond my individual contribution\n    And I know: this is how democracy perpetuates itself\n",
