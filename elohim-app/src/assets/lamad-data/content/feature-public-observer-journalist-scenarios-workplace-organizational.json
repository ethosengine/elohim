Labor and Economic Justice Journalism for Journalist\n  As a journalist in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want comprehensive labor surveillance and economic data\n  So that labor journalism holds employers and regulators accountable\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the journalist user is registered in the system\n    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Journalist monitors labor board and regulatory hearings\n    Given the journalist covers labor and employment\n    And must track labor board, wage enforcement, OSHA, and related agencies\n    When the Observer monitors all labor regulatory agencies\n    Then the journalist reviews all violation cases and enforcement actions\n    And receives alerts for significant labor violations\n    And tracks patterns in enforcement and employer violations\n    And comprehensive labor accountability coverage becomes sustainable\n    And worker exploitation cannot hide in regulatory obscurity\n\n  Scenario: Journalist exposes wage theft pattern across employers\n    Given workers report unpaid wages and overtime violations\n    And the journalist investigates wage theft\n    When the Observer analyzes wage violation enforcement data\n    Then the journalist sees systematic wage theft across multiple employers\n    And identifies industries with concentrated violations\n    And documents millions in stolen wages and minimal enforcement\n    And shows workers of color disproportionately affected\n    And publishes investigation exposing wage theft epidemic\n\n  Scenario: Journalist investigates workplace safety violations\n    Given workers report unsafe conditions at warehouse\n    And the journalist covers workplace safety\n    When the Observer analyzes employer's safety violation history\n    Then the journalist finds company has 47 OSHA violations in 5 years\n    And sees pattern of violations detected but minimally fined\n    And documents worker injuries and company's inadequate response\n    And shows same company violates safety rules at facilities in other states\n    And publishes investigation forcing regulatory accountability\n\n  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks employer claims during union campaign\n    Given workers organize union at major retailer\n    And employer makes claims about wages and benefits\n    When the Observer provides instant fact-checking against labor data\n    Then the journalist verifies wage claim is misleading (includes management)\n    And finds actual frontline worker wages below poverty level\n    And shows benefits exclude most workers due to hour restrictions\n    And identifies employer's union-busting expenditures\n    And publishes real-time fact-check supporting informed worker vote\n\n  Scenario: Journalist tracks economic development promises to accountability\n    Given company received tax incentives for job creation\n    And the journalist covered initial economic development announcement\n    When the Observer monitors job creation and wage outcomes\n    Then the journalist finds company created 40% of promised jobs\n    And sees wages are lower than promised in tax incentive agreement\n    And documents tax breaks cost more than economic benefit\n    And identifies lack of enforcement from economic development agency\n    And publishes accountability story on corporate welfare waste\n\n  Scenario: Journalist exposes misclassification of workers as contractors\n    Given gig economy companies classify workers as independent contractors\n    And the journalist investigates worker classification\n    When the Observer analyzes employment patterns and labor violations\n    Then the journalist sees workers have employer control without worker rights\n    And documents workers denied minimum wage, overtime, and benefits\n    And shows companies avoid taxes through misclassification\n    And identifies regulatory agencies failing to enforce classification rules\n    And publishes investigation on worker exploitation through misclassification\n\n  Scenario: Journalist develops worker sources on retaliation\n    Given workers face retaliation for organizing or complaining\n    And fear job loss for speaking to journalist\n    When the Observer provides secure anonymous channel\n    Then workers share evidence of retaliation and illegal firings\n    And journalist investigates without exposing individual sources\n    And aggregates worker experiences to show pattern\n    And verifies claims through labor board records\n    And publishes investigation protecting sources while exposing employer\n    And source protection enables workers to speak truth\n\n  Scenario: Journalist investigates regional economic inequality patterns\n    Given the journalist covers regional economy\n    And economic growth statistics mask inequality\n    When the Observer analyzes economic data by demographics and geography\n    Then the journalist sees wage growth concentrated in top income brackets\n    And documents working-class wage stagnation despite economic growth claims\n    And shows poverty increasing in communities of color despite job growth\n    And identifies industries paying poverty wages receiving subsidies\n    And publishes investigation exposing economic inequality\n    And pattern recognition reveals who benefits from \"strong economy\"\n",
