Community Wealth Building Through Democratic Investment\n  As a community_investor in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want to build community wealth through values-aligned investment\n  So that capital supports democratic ownership and neighborhood flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Patricia lives in neighborhood with emerging democratic economy\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And community investment pools enable local democratic ownership\n\n  Scenario: Investor redirects capital from extractive corporations to democratic community businesses\n    Given Patricia has $60K in index funds funding corporate extraction\n    And she morally opposes enterprises her capital funds but lacked alternatives\n    When community investment pool offers values-aligned local alternative\n    Then she moves $10K from stock market to community investment in Maria's Kitchen conversion\n    And capital directly funds worker ownership, not corporate extraction\n    And investment aligns with values: worker dignity, community wealth, environmental stewardship\n    And financial returns are fair (5% annually) while social returns are massive\n    And community_elohim facilitates investment pool management and transparent reporting\n\n  Scenario: Investor receives transparent impact reports showing measurable community benefits\n    Given stock market investing provides opaque financial returns with invisible social impacts\n    And Patricia couldn't verify her portfolio's real effects\n    When community investment provides radical transparency\n    Then quarterly reports show: 12 workers received ownership and wage increases ($11\u2192$18/hour)\n    And 340 community meals served to isolated seniors\n    And 1,200 lbs regenerative produce sourced from Johnson Farm\n    And $40K circulating locally vs. extracting to distant shareholders\n    And community_elohim provides detailed, verifiable impact documentation\n\n  Scenario: Investor builds direct relationships with workers her capital supports\n    Given stock market investment is anonymous and extractive\n    And Patricia never met workers her capital exploited\n    When community investment creates relationship opportunities\n    Then she knows Maria, DeShawn, Emma\u2014workers her investment helped liberate\n    And attends stakeholder meetings learning about challenges and successes\n    And workers appreciate her support without surrendering governance autonomy\n    And relationship is asymmetric but not extractive (she has capital, they create value, both benefit fairly)\n    And community_elohim facilitates investor-worker relationships protecting democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Investor participates in community investment pool governance\n    Given traditional investing gives shareholders plutocratic pseudo-democracy\n    And Patricia wants genuine participation, not capital-weighted control\n    When community investment pool has democratic governance structure\n    Then she participates in pool governance as one voice among equals\n    And investment decisions consider community benefit alongside financial returns\n    And pool priorities are set democratically by investors, workers, and community representatives\n    And governance prevents capital from dominating democratic enterprises\n    And community_elohim manages investment pool democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Investor earns fair financial returns without requiring extraction\n    Given stock market averages ~7% annual returns through maximizing extraction\n    And Patricia accepted lower returns (5%) for values alignment\n    When democratic business proves financially sustainable\n    Then 5% returns are paid reliably from business revenue\n    And returns come from democratic value circulation, not worker exploitation\n    And financial viability proves extraction isn't necessary for investor returns\n    And she earns modestly while workers earn living wages and community benefits\n    And community_elohim ensures transparent return calculations and timely payments\n\n  Scenario: Investor diversifies across multiple democratic enterprises reducing risk\n    Given individual business investment is high-risk\n    And Patricia needs diversification for financial security\n    When community investment pool spreads capital across multiple conversions\n    Then her $10K in pool supports Maria's Kitchen, Rosa's Auto, and neighborhood retail\n    And portfolio diversification reduces single-business failure risk\n    And democratic network mutual support further reduces risk\n    And risk management is transparent and community-governed\n    And community_elohim coordinates portfolio diversification and risk management\n\n  Scenario: Investor sees capital enable dignified transitions for small business owners\n    Given traditional buyers would exploit workers or destroy community institutions\n    And small business owners like Rosa faced impossible exit choices\n    When Patricia's investment enables exit-to-community conversions\n    Then Rosa achieves financial security ($180K) while protecting workers\n    And legacy is preserved as democratic community institution\n    And investor capital makes dignified transition possible\n    And community institutions are preserved through patient investment\n    And community_elohim facilitates transition financing and stakeholder support\n\n  Scenario: Investor discovers community connection through investment network\n    Given stock market investing is isolating\n    And Patricia managed portfolio individually without community\n    When community investment creates investor network\n    Then she knows other neighborhood residents who invested in democratic conversions\n    And investors share motivations, coordinate for larger projects, build community wealth strategy\n    And investment becomes collective political project, not individual portfolio management\n    And community connections deepen through shared values and collaboration\n    And community_elohim facilitates investor network development and coordination\n\n  Scenario: Investor consumption and investment align supporting same democratic businesses\n    Given Patricia's consumption and investment were previously disconnected activities\n    And roles as customer and investor didn't integrate\n    When she invests in and patronizes same democratic businesses\n    Then consumption supports investment supports values supports community\n    And economic activities align creating virtuous cycle\n    And integrated participation deepens commitment and impact\n    And community economic participation becomes holistic, not fragmented\n    And community_elohim helps investors see connections between consumption and investment\n\n  Scenario: Investor capital enables community programs addressing neighborhood needs\n    Given traditional investment extracts value from communities\n    And Patricia wanted investment supporting community benefit, not extraction\n    When democratic business allocates revenue to community programs\n    Then her investment enables senior meal programs, youth employment, community space\n    And investment returns include social dividends: stronger community, less isolation, economic opportunity\n    And capital builds community infrastructure, not just individual wealth\n    And social returns are documented and valued alongside financial returns\n    And community_elohim manages community program funding from democratic business revenue\n\n  Scenario: Investor advocacy spreads community investment model to neighbors\n    Given most community members don't know democratic investment options exist\n    And Patricia's neighbors invest in stock market by default\n    When she shares community investment experience\n    Then neighbors learn about values-aligned local investment opportunities\n    And some redirect capital from stock market to community investment pool\n    And investment pool grows enabling more democratic conversions\n    And movement builds through investor advocacy and demonstration\n    And community_elohim supports investor education and community outreach\n\n  Scenario: Investor exit flexibility protects financial security while supporting patient capital\n    Given Patricia may need liquidity for emergencies or life changes\n    And democratic enterprises benefit from patient capital stability\n    When investment structure balances investor needs with enterprise stability\n    Then she can exit investment with 90-day notice if needed\n    And encouraged to commit 3-5 years for business planning stability\n    And exit terms are clear and fair protecting both investor and business\n    And flexibility reduces investment barrier while supporting democratic enterprise needs\n    And community_elohim manages exit processes fairly and transparently\n",
