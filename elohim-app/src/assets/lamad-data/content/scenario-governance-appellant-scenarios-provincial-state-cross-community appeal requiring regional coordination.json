  "content": "Scenario: Cross-community appeal requiring regional coordination\n    Given my appeal involves agent decisions affecting multiple communities\n    And communities have different local calibrations creating conflict\n    When Regional Constitutional Council reviews the inter-community issue\n    Then they evaluate how subsidiarity principle applies across communities\n    And They examine if regional coordination is constitutionally required\n    And They consider if local diversity should be preserved or harmonized\n    And They may establish regional minimums while allowing local variation\n    And They create precedent for how communities coordinate at scale\n    And My appeal contributes to multi-layer governance coherence\n",
