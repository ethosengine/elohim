  "content": "Scenario: Global research ethics and decolonizing methodology\n    Given historical research often extracted from Global South for Global North benefit\n    And I want to practice ethical global research\n    When I design my research methodology and partnerships\n    Then I ensure: local researchers lead studies in their contexts\n    And I practice: equitable benefit sharing and co-authorship\n    And I support: capacity building in Global South institutions\n    And I challenge: Western-centric theories and methods\n    And I listen: to diverse epistemologies and knowledge systems\n    And I acknowledge: positionality and power in research relationships\n    And My practice embodies: research ethics aligned with protocol's dignity principles\n",
