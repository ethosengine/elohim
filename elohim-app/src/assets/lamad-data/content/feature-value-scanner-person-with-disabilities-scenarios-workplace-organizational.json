Workplace Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities\n  As a person with disabilities employed part-time with accommodations\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want my workplace rights protected and my contributions recognized\n  So that I can work with dignity, proper accommodations, and fair treatment\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the person_with_disabilities user \"Alex\" is registered in the system\n    And Alex works part-time remotely as a data analyst\n    And Alex has cerebral palsy affecting mobility and fine motor control\n    And Alex's workplace requires ongoing accommodation negotiations\n    And the workplace governance context is active\n    And the workplace_elohim supports Alex's workplace rights\n    And Alex combines part-time employment with disability benefits\n\n  Scenario: Workplace accommodations legally required and systematically tracked\n    Given Alex requires specific workplace accommodations\n    And accommodations are legally mandated under ADA\n    When Alex requests workplace accommodations\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex document accommodation requests\n    And it should track whether employer provides required accommodations\n    And it should maintain records of all accommodation-related communications\n    And Alex should have documentation to support legal action if necessary\n    And the protocol should recognize that accommodation is right, not favor\n    And Alex should be supported in asserting legal rights\n    And workplace obligations should be clearly documented\n\n  Scenario: Protecting Alex from workplace discrimination\n    Given workplace discrimination against disabled people is common\n    And ableism often operates subtly\n    When potential discrimination occurs\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex identify discriminatory patterns\n    And it should document incidents that might constitute discrimination\n    And it should connect Alex to legal resources and advocacy support\n    And patterns across time should be made visible\n    And Alex should have tools to protect their workplace rights\n    And the protocol should recognize that workplaces can be hostile\n    And evidence collection should be systematic and thorough\n\n  Scenario: Flexible scheduling accommodates medical appointments and fatigue\n    Given Alex has medical appointments and disability-related health needs\n    And fatigue is a real factor in Alex's work capacity\n    When Alex manages work schedule\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help negotiate flexible scheduling\n    And it should track accommodation requests for schedule flexibility\n    And Alex should be able to adjust hours around medical needs\n    And part-time status should be respected as appropriate for Alex's capacity\n    And the protocol should support Alex in managing work-life balance\n    And flexible scheduling should be framed as reasonable accommodation\n    And Alex's productivity should be measured appropriately for part-time work\n\n  Scenario: Accessible technology is workplace obligation not special treatment\n    Given Alex requires accessible technology to perform job functions\n    And technology access is fundamental workplace accommodation\n    When Alex uses workplace technology\n    Then employer must provide accessible technology as legal requirement\n    And the workplace_elohim should document technology accessibility\n    And it should track when technology barriers prevent Alex from working\n    And Alex should not have to use inaccessible systems\n    And employer should be held accountable for accessibility failures\n    And the protocol should recognize accessible tech as baseline, not luxury\n    And Alex's right to accessible tools should be systematically defended\n\n  Scenario: Remote work as disability accommodation maintains employment access\n    Given Alex works remotely as necessary accommodation\n    And remote work enables Alex's employment despite mobility limitations\n    When workplace policies change\n    Then Alex's right to remote work accommodation should be protected\n    And the workplace_elohim should document remote work as accommodation\n    And employer cannot eliminate remote work for Alex without undue hardship proof\n    And Alex's legal right to accommodation should override general policy changes\n    And the protocol should help Alex defend remote work arrangement\n    And pandemic-normalized remote work should benefit disabled workers permanently\n    And Alex should not lose employment due to return-to-office mandates\n\n  Scenario: Performance evaluation accounts for part-time status and accommodations\n    Given Alex works part-time with accommodations\n    And performance should be measured appropriately for Alex's situation\n    When Alex receives performance evaluations\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex ensure fair evaluation\n    And expectations should be adjusted for part-time hours worked\n    And accommodations should not be held against Alex\n    And productivity should be measured per hours worked, not full-time standard\n    And disability-related absences should not negatively impact evaluation\n    And the protocol should support Alex in advocating for fair treatment\n    And evaluation should recognize Alex's actual contributions accurately\n\n  Scenario: Workplace culture education reduces ableism\n    Given workplace culture often reflects ableist assumptions\n    And coworkers may lack disability awareness\n    When the workplace_elohim detects cultural issues\n    Then it should help Alex identify patterns of workplace ableism\n    And it should provide Alex tools to educate coworkers when Alex chooses\n    And it should support Alex in advocating for cultural change\n    And workplace should be prompted toward disability inclusion training\n    And Alex should be compensated if providing disability education\n    And the protocol should recognize that cultural change is ongoing work\n    And Alex should not bear sole responsibility for workplace education\n\n  Scenario: Preventing workplace retaliation for accommodation requests\n    Given employers sometimes retaliate against workers who request accommodations\n    And retaliation can be subtle (worse assignments, social exclusion, negative evaluations)\n    When Alex requests accommodations or asserts rights\n    Then the workplace_elohim should monitor for retaliation patterns\n    And it should document timeline of accommodation requests and subsequent treatment changes\n    And it should help Alex identify legally actionable retaliation\n    And Alex should be connected to legal resources if retaliation occurs\n    And the protocol should protect Alex from employer retaliation systematically\n    And documentation should support legal claims if necessary\n    And Alex should feel supported in asserting rights without fear\n\n  Scenario: Income from employment integrated with disability benefits\n    Given Alex receives both part-time employment income and disability benefits\n    And benefits coordination is complex\n    When the workplace_elohim tracks Alex's income\n    Then it should help Alex understand how employment income affects benefits\n    And it should alert Alex to earnings thresholds that impact benefits\n    And it should integrate with household economics management\n    And Alex should be able to make informed decisions about work hours\n    And the protocol should support Alex in maximizing total income\n    And benefits cliffs should be navigated carefully\n    And Alex's economic stability should be optimized across income sources\n\n  Scenario: Professional identity maintained alongside disability identity\n    Given Alex is a skilled data analyst with professional expertise\n    And disability is part of Alex's identity but doesn't define professional capability\n    When workplace interactions occur\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex be seen as competent professional\n    And it should support Alex in asserting expertise and professional standing\n    And disability should not overshadow Alex's professional contributions\n    And Alex should be respected for skills and knowledge\n    And the protocol should help balance disability advocacy with professional identity\n    And Alex should not have to choose between being professional and being disabled\n    And both identities should be honored simultaneously\n\n  Scenario: Career development opportunities accessible to Alex\n    Given disabled workers often face barriers to advancement\n    And Alex has professional ambitions and development goals\n    When career development opportunities arise\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex access training and advancement\n    And it should track whether Alex receives equal access to opportunities\n    And it should document if disability limits Alex's career progression unfairly\n    And Alex should be supported in pursuing professional goals\n    And the protocol should help Alex advocate for inclusive career paths\n    And advancement should be possible for disabled workers\n    And Alex's professional growth should be supported systematically\n\n  Scenario: Workplace privacy protects Alex's medical information\n    Given employers should not have access to private medical information\n    And disability disclosure is often required but should be limited\n    When workplace requests disability documentation\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help Alex share minimum necessary information\n    And it should protect Alex's medical privacy rigorously\n    And detailed medical information should never be shared with managers or coworkers\n    And only accommodation needs should be disclosed, not diagnoses\n    And Alex's privacy should be protected even while requesting accommodations\n    And the protocol should guide appropriate disclosure boundaries\n    And medical information should remain confidential\n\n  Scenario: Collective organizing with other disabled workers\n    Given disabled workers face common workplace barriers\n    And collective action is more powerful than individual advocacy\n    When Alex connects with other disabled workers\n    Then the workplace_elohim should facilitate disabled worker organizing\n    And it should help Alex build solidarity with other disabled employees\n    And collective accommodation requests should be coordinated\n    And workplace accessibility improvements should benefit all disabled workers\n    And the protocol should support disability labor organizing\n    And collective power should be built for systemic workplace change\n    And Alex should be connected to broader disability labor rights movements\n",
