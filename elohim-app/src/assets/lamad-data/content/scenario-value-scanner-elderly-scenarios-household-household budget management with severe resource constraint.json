  "content": "Scenario: Household budget management with severe resource constraint\n    Given Helen's $24k/year income barely covers necessities\n    And household expenses are challenging on fixed income\n    When the household_elohim manages budget tracking\n    Then it should help Helen navigate financial limitations\n    And priority should be given to keeping her housed\n    And community resources for home maintenance should be surfaced\n    And no shame should attach to needing financial assistance\n    And the system should connect her to care economy support\n    And assistance should flow as reciprocity, not charity\n    And Helen's ability to remain in her home should be prioritized\n",
