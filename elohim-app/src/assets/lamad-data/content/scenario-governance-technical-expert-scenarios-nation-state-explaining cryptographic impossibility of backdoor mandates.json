  "content": "Scenario: Explaining cryptographic impossibility of backdoor mandates\n    Given policy makers consider requiring backdoors for law enforcement\n    And this would break constitutional verification\n    When I testify to National Council about technical implications\n    Then I explain: backdoors make cryptographic alignment proof impossible\n    And I clarify: cannot have both backdoors and constitutional verification\n    And I demonstrate: this is mathematical fact not implementation choice\n    And I present: security vulnerabilities backdoors create\n    And I acknowledge: this constrains what governance can mandate\n    And I provide: evidence policy makers need for informed choice\n    And I maintain: that I'm explaining constraints not dictating values\n",
