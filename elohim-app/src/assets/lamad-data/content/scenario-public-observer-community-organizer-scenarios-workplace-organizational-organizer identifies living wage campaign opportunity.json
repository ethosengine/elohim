  "content": "Scenario: Organizer identifies living wage campaign opportunity\n    Given city council will consider minimum wage ordinance\n    And workers struggle with poverty wages despite full-time work\n    When the Observer surfaces the organizing opportunity\n    Then the organizer sees local wage patterns and living wage gap\n    And identifies which workers and communities are most affected\n    And gets analysis showing public subsidies to low-wage employers\n    And receives alert early enough to organize worker-community coalition\n    And municipal wage policy becomes organizing opportunity\n",
