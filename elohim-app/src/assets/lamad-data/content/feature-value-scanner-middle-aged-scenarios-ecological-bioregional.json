Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult\n  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want to integrate care for people with care for planet through sustainable practices\n  So that I model ecological stewardship for the next generation and build resilient bioregional care economy\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the middle-aged user \"Robert\" is registered in the system\n    And Robert is 52 years old managing household and multigenerational care\n    And the ecological governance context is active\n    And bioregional_elohim coordinates ecological care economy\n    And Robert's consumption and care practices affect ecological systems\n\n  Scenario: Household consumption patterns analyzed for ecological impact\n    Given Robert's household consumes resources and generates waste\n    And consumption choices affect ecological systems\n    And middle-aged adults often have highest consumption footprint\n    When bioregional_elohim analyzes household ecological impact\n    Then it should track resource consumption, energy use, and waste generation\n    And surface patterns: \"Your household consumes 40% above bioregional sustainable average\"\n    And help Robert understand ecological impact of consumption choices\n    And connect consumption to bioregional carrying capacity\n    And support reduction strategies that maintain quality of life\n    And demonstrate that care economy includes ecological care\n    And build household practices that serve bioregional health\n\n  Scenario: Care economy practices integrated with ecological sustainability\n    Given care work requires resources: food, transportation, housing, energy\n    And care practices can be more or less ecologically sustainable\n    And sustainable care economy serves both human and ecological flourishing\n    When bioregional_elohim integrates care and ecology\n    Then it should help Robert align care practices with ecological sustainability\n    And surface opportunities: \"Local food sourcing reduces transportation impact while supporting regional care economy\"\n    And recognize that care for people and care for planet are interconnected\n    And support practices that serve both human and ecological wellbeing\n    And demonstrate that care economy must be ecologically sustainable\n    And build integrated understanding of care and ecology\n    And model for next generation that care includes ecological stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Multigenerational teaching about ecological care responsibility\n    Given Robert teaches values to children and grandchildren through practice\n    And ecological sustainability requires intergenerational commitment\n    And his generation must prepare next generation for ecological challenges\n    When bioregional_elohim supports ecological education\n    Then it should help Robert model ecological care practices for younger generations\n    And surface teaching opportunities through everyday choices\n    And recognize: \"Your composting practice teaches grandchildren about waste reduction\"\n    And support him in explaining ecological choices to family\n    And build intergenerational ecological literacy through practice\n    And demonstrate that ecological care is care economy responsibility\n    And prepare next generation for ecological stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional food systems participation supports care and ecology\n    Given Robert's household needs food\n    And food choices affect ecological health and care economy\n    And bioregional food systems can serve both\n    When bioregional_elohim supports food system participation\n    Then it should connect Robert to bioregional food networks\n    And surface opportunities for local food sourcing, community gardens, and food cooperatives\n    And recognize that supporting regional farmers is care economy participation\n    And help him understand food system ecological impact\n    And support food choices that serve bioregional health and care economy\n    And demonstrate that eating is care for people and planet\n    And build bioregional food resilience through participation\n\n  Scenario: Transportation choices balance care needs with ecological impact\n    Given Robert travels for work, parent care, and family support\n    And transportation has substantial ecological impact\n    And care responsibilities create transportation needs\n    When bioregional_elohim analyzes transportation\n    Then it should track transportation ecological impact\n    And help Robert optimize travel to reduce impact while meeting care needs\n    And surface alternatives: \"Video call could replace 200-mile drive for parent check-in\"\n    And recognize when care needs require travel despite ecological cost\n    And support sustainable transportation choices where possible\n    And prevent guilt about necessary care-related travel\n    And build transportation patterns that balance care and ecology\n\n  Scenario: Housing and energy use optimized for sustainability\n    Given Robert's household uses energy for heating, cooling, and power\n    And housing energy use significantly affects ecological impact\n    And household improvements can reduce ecological footprint\n    When bioregional_elohim supports energy optimization\n    Then it should analyze household energy consumption patterns\n    And suggest improvements: insulation, renewable energy, efficiency upgrades\n    And connect energy reduction to cost savings that support care economy participation\n    And help Robert prioritize improvements within household budget\n    And recognize that sustainable housing serves current and future generations\n    And demonstrate that ecological stewardship is long-term care\n    And build household infrastructure that reduces bioregional impact\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional care economy networks reduce consumption through sharing\n    Given many resources are underutilized in individual households\n    And sharing reduces consumption while building care networks\n    And bioregional resilience requires resource cooperation\n    When bioregional_elohim facilitates resource sharing\n    Then it should connect Robert to bioregional sharing networks\n    And support participation in tool libraries, car sharing, and resource exchange\n    And recognize that sharing reduces ecological impact and builds care economy\n    And track ecological benefits of sharing: \"Tool sharing prevented 8 redundant purchases\"\n    And demonstrate that care economy and ecological sustainability are aligned\n    And build bioregional resilience through sharing economy\n    And reduce consumption through care economy participation\n\n  Scenario: Lifecycle consumption awareness from birth through end-of-life\n    Given Robert has observed full lifecycle from grandchildren to aging parents\n    And he recognizes consumption patterns across lifespan\n    And lifecycle awareness can inform sustainable choices\n    When bioregional_elohim supports lifecycle consumption awareness\n    Then it should help Robert understand consumption across full lifecycle\n    And surface how current choices affect future generations' ecological inheritance\n    And recognize: \"Reducing consumption now preserves resources for grandchildren's future\"\n    And connect present choices to long-term bioregional health\n    And support sustainable consumption motivated by intergenerational care\n    And demonstrate that ecological stewardship is care for future generations\n    And build consumption patterns that serve lifecycle sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional governance participation includes ecological voice\n    Given bioregional health requires governance that includes ecological considerations\n    And Robert participates in community and municipal governance\n    And his voice can advocate for bioregional ecological health\n    When bioregional_elohim supports ecological governance\n    Then it should help Robert bring ecological perspective to governance participation\n    And support advocacy for bioregional ecological protection\n    And connect him to watershed councils, land use planning, and environmental policy\n    And recognize his care economy participation as qualifying him for ecological governance\n    And build governance that integrates human and ecological flourishing\n    And advance bioregional policy that serves care economy and ecology\n    And demonstrate that care economy includes bioregional stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Climate adaptation planning for multigenerational family resilience\n    Given climate change affects bioregional systems\n    And Robert's family will navigate climate impacts across generations\n    And adaptation planning protects family and bioregional resilience\n    When bioregional_elohim supports climate adaptation\n    Then it should help Robert plan for climate impacts on family\n    And surface bioregional climate risks: drought, flooding, extreme weather\n    And support household adaptation: water conservation, emergency preparedness, resilient food systems\n    And connect adaptation to care economy principles\n    And recognize that climate adaptation is care for family and bioregion\n    And build resilience that serves current and future generations\n    And demonstrate that ecological care is practical family responsibility\n\n  Scenario: Work and career choices evaluated for ecological impact\n    Given Robert's professional work affects ecological systems\n    And career choices have bioregional ecological consequences\n    And some work serves ecological health while other work degrades it\n    When bioregional_elohim analyzes professional ecological impact\n    Then it should help Robert understand his work's ecological footprint\n    And surface opportunities to align profession with ecological health\n    And recognize when professional choices serve or harm bioregional systems\n    And support career decisions that integrate care economy and ecological values\n    And demonstrate that professional work is ecological care or harm\n    And build careers that serve bioregional flourishing\n    And advance ecological sustainability through professional choices\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional economic localization supports care and ecological resilience\n    Given globalized economy increases ecological impact\n    And bioregional economic localization can reduce impact while building care economy\n    And Robert's economic choices affect regional resilience\n    When bioregional_elohim supports economic localization\n    Then it should help Robert source goods and services bioregionally\n    And connect him to regional producers, workers, and care economy networks\n    And recognize that local economic participation reduces transportation impact\n    And demonstrate that care economy and ecological sustainability align through localization\n    And build bioregional economic resilience through local exchange\n    And reduce ecological impact through regional economic relationships\n    And advance care economy through bioregional economic networks\n\n  Scenario: Legacy and intergenerational responsibility for bioregional health\n    Given Robert's generation has substantially affected bioregional ecology\n    And his choices affect ecological inheritance for grandchildren\n    And intergenerational responsibility requires ecological repair and protection\n    When bioregional_elohim supports legacy planning\n    Then it should help Robert understand his generation's ecological impact\n    And recognize responsibility to repair damage and protect bioregional health\n    And surface opportunities for ecological restoration participation\n    And support him in building positive ecological legacy\n    And connect ecological stewardship to care for grandchildren's future\n    And demonstrate that care economy includes intergenerational ecological responsibility\n    And build commitment to bioregional health as care for future generations\n",
