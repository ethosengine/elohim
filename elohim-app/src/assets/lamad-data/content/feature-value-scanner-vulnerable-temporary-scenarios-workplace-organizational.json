  "content": "Feature: Workplace Navigation and Employment Search During Temporary Vulnerability\n  As a person seeking employment while navigating temporary vulnerability\n  I want tools to find dignified work while avoiding exploitation\n  So that I can build toward economic stability without sacrificing recovery or wellbeing\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am seeking employment after crisis or during recovery\n    And I face employment barriers (resume gaps, childcare constraints, trauma, stigma)\n    And I am using the workplace_elohim to navigate employment search and workplace issues\n    And I need employment that supports rather than undermines my rebuilding\n\n  Scenario: Presenting employment capabilities despite resume gaps and crisis circumstances\n    Given I have gaps in my employment history due to domestic violence and crisis\n    And potential employers may discriminate based on gaps or circumstances\n    When I apply for employment opportunities\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me present my capabilities effectively\n    And provides strategies for explaining employment gaps honestly but strategically\n    And helps me articulate transferable skills and competencies\n    And recognizes my crisis navigation as demonstrating valuable skills\n    And validates that gaps don't erase my professional capability\n    And my personal_agent helps me craft application materials\n    And tracks my employment search efforts and outcomes\n    And celebrates my courage in seeking employment during recovery\n\n  Scenario: Identifying employment opportunities that are genuine versus exploitative\n    Given some employers specifically target vulnerable people for exploitation\n    And I am vulnerable to accepting exploitative work due to desperation\n    When I evaluate employment opportunities\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me assess whether opportunities are exploitative\n    And identifies red flags (unpaid \"training\", illegal pay practices, unsafe conditions, unrealistic expectations)\n    And validates that I deserve fair employment, not exploitation\n    And helps me decline opportunities that would harm my recovery\n    And surfaces genuinely fair employment options\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to concerning employer patterns\n    And recognizes that protecting myself from exploitation is essential\n    And supports me waiting for appropriate opportunity rather than accepting harm\n\n  Scenario: Negotiating employment flexibility for childcare and recovery needs\n    Given I need employment flexibility for childcare, therapy, legal appointments, and crisis management\n    And employers may resist flexibility or see it as liability\n    When I negotiate employment terms\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me request appropriate accommodations\n    And provides language for negotiating flexibility professionally\n    And helps me understand my legal rights to reasonable accommodation\n    And validates that my needs are reasonable and should be accommodated\n    And identifies employers more likely to provide needed flexibility\n    And my personal_agent coaches me through negotiation conversations\n    And recognizes that advocating for my needs is professional strength\n    And supports me in finding employment compatible with my life\n\n  Scenario: Managing workplace disclosure about domestic violence or crisis circumstances\n    Given employers may ask about gaps, circumstances, or background\n    And disclosure could lead to discrimination or could generate support\n    When I decide what to disclose to employers\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me evaluate disclosure risks and benefits\n    And provides guidance on legal protections against discrimination\n    And suggests strategic disclosure approaches when disclosure is beneficial\n    And validates my right to privacy about personal circumstances\n    And helps me navigate background checks or verification issues\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of what I've decided to disclose vs. protect\n    And recognizes disclosure decisions as complex risk assessment\n    And supports my autonomy in disclosure choices\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating employment search with childcare constraints\n    Given I can only work when childcare is available and affordable\n    And childcare availability severely limits employment options\n    When I search for employment compatible with childcare\n    Then the workplace_elohim filters opportunities by schedule and childcare compatibility\n    And identifies employers offering childcare support or flexibility\n    And helps me calculate whether employment pays enough after childcare costs\n    And coordinates employment search with childcare subsidy applications\n    And validates that childcare constraints are real barriers, not excuses\n    And my personal_agent tracks childcare availability and employment schedule compatibility\n    And recognizes that coordinating employment and childcare is complex labor\n    And ensures employment genuinely improves rather than worsens my situation\n\n  Scenario: Building toward employment while not currently ready to work\n    Given I am still in acute crisis or early trauma recovery\n    And employment right now would overwhelm my capacity\n    When I plan for future employment while not currently seeking work\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me identify skill-building opportunities\n    And surfaces training, education, or credential programs I could pursue\n    And validates that not being employment-ready yet is appropriate\n    And helps me build toward future employment at my pace\n    And tracks my skill development and preparation\n    And my personal_agent identifies low-pressure ways to build employment readiness\n    And recognizes that recovery before employment is often necessary\n    And supports my timeline for employment readiness\n\n  Scenario: Understanding workplace rights and protections as vulnerable worker\n    Given I may face workplace discrimination, harassment, or rights violations\n    And vulnerable workers are often targeted for workplace abuse\n    When I encounter workplace problems or need to understand my rights\n    Then the workplace_elohim provides information on my workplace rights\n    And helps me identify illegal workplace practices\n    And connects me to legal resources or worker advocacy organizations\n    And validates that I deserve workplace protection and dignity\n    And helps me document workplace problems\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to rights violations\n    And recognizes that vulnerable workers need extra rights awareness\n    And supports me in demanding legal workplace treatment\n\n  Scenario: Accessing employment support services and job training programs\n    Given various programs offer employment support for vulnerable populations\n    And these programs vary widely in quality and appropriateness\n    When I seek employment support services\n    Then the workplace_elohim identifies quality employment support programs\n    And helps me access job training, resume support, interview coaching\n    And evaluates whether programs are genuinely helpful vs. bureaucratic\n    And connects me to programs that respect my dignity and capability\n    And validates that I deserve quality employment support\n    And my personal_agent tracks program applications and requirements\n    And recognizes that navigating employment services is labor\n    And ensures employment support actually supports rather than burdens me\n\n  Scenario: Managing workplace performance while dealing with ongoing trauma and stress\n    Given I am working while still recovering from trauma\n    And trauma symptoms may affect my workplace performance\n    When trauma impacts my work capability\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me manage performance expectations realistically\n    And provides strategies for trauma management in workplace\n    And helps me access workplace mental health resources if available\n    And validates that trauma affects work capacity and that's normal\n    And identifies when workplace environment is retraumatizing\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of coping strategies during work stress\n    And recognizes that working while traumatized is extraordinarily difficult\n    And supports appropriate accommodations or job changes if needed\n\n  Scenario: Evaluating whether employment genuinely supports or undermines stability-building\n    Given some employment could undermine rather than support my rebuilding\n    And I need work that enables rather than prevents stability\n    When I evaluate employment opportunities holistically\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me assess total impact of employment\n    And considers financial benefit, schedule compatibility, stress level, childcare impact, recovery support\n    And validates that employment should improve my situation, not worsen it\n    And helps me identify when employment costs more (financially, emotionally, practically) than it provides\n    And my personal_agent evaluates opportunities against my whole situation\n    And recognizes that not all employment serves vulnerable people\n    And supports me declining employment that would harm my rebuilding\n\n  Scenario: Building professional network and references despite isolation and crisis\n    Given professional networking requires time, energy, and social capital I lack\n    And I need professional connections for employment opportunities\n    When I work to build professional network\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me identify low-barrier networking opportunities\n    And suggests strategies for building professional connections despite constraints\n    And helps me leverage existing relationships for professional support\n    And validates that networking is harder during crisis and that's not my fault\n    And connects me to professional networks for people in similar situations\n    And my personal_agent identifies networking opportunities matching my capacity\n    And recognizes networking efforts as valuable professional development\n    And celebrates each professional connection built\n\n  Scenario: Accessing workplace benefits and resources for family stability\n    Given employment may provide benefits (health insurance, paid leave, retirement) critical for stability\n    And I need to maximize workplace benefits for family wellbeing\n    When I evaluate or access workplace benefits\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me understand and maximize available benefits\n    And guides enrollment in health insurance, retirement, other benefits\n    And identifies workplace resources (EAP, childcare support, emergency assistance)\n    And validates that benefits are part of compensation, not \"extras\"\n    And helps me advocate for benefits if employer is unclear about offerings\n    And my personal_agent tracks benefit enrollment deadlines and requirements\n    And recognizes that benefits navigation is complex invisible labor\n    And ensures I access all benefits supporting family stability\n\n  Scenario: Transitioning from temporary assistance to employment without losing critical support prematurely\n    Given I receive temporary assistance (SNAP, TANF, housing support, childcare subsidies)\n    And employment may affect benefit eligibility\n    When I transition from assistance to employment\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me understand benefits cliff dynamics\n    And calculates whether employment genuinely improves my financial situation after benefit loss\n    And identifies transition supports that prevent benefit cliff harm\n    And validates that benefits cliff is policy failure, not my failure\n    And helps me time employment transition to minimize harm\n    And my personal_agent tracks benefit eligibility thresholds and employment income\n    And recognizes that benefits navigation is complex policy navigation labor\n    And ensures employment transition genuinely serves rather than harms my family\n",
