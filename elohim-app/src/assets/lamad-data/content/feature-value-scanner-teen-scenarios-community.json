Community Layer Value Recognition for Teen\n  As a teen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want to be recognized as a full participant in community care economy\n  So that I access resources based on contribution and build relationships with community institutions\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teen user \"Jasmine\" is registered in the system\n    And Jasmine is 16 years old\n    And she lives in the Riverside community\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates community-wide care economy\n    And Jasmine has accumulated care contributions across household, work, and volunteering\n\n  Scenario: Teen recognized as full community participant, not future member\n    Given Jasmine has substantial care contributions across multiple contexts\n    And she volunteers 4 hours per week at community center\n    When the community_elohim processes her participation\n    Then she should be recognized as a current contributor, not a youth in training\n    And her care work should be valued at the same care economy rate as adults\n    And community resources should be accessible based on her demonstrated contribution\n    And she should have standing in community care economy discussions\n    And the system should reflect that she is already a productive member of society\n    And her generation's contributions should be made visible at community scale\n\n  Scenario: Teen accesses community resources based on care contributions\n    Given Jasmine has accumulated significant care tokens\n    And the community offers educational programs and skill-building workshops\n    When Jasmine seeks to access community opportunities\n    Then her care contributions should qualify her for access\n    And she should not need parent mediation to access community resources\n    And the community_elohim should recognize her as an independent participant\n    And opportunities should be surfaced based on her interests and contribution patterns\n    And she should experience that care economy operates on reciprocity\n    And her care tokens should give her legitimate standing to access community resources\n\n  Scenario: Community opportunities surfaced based on teen's care patterns\n    Given Jasmine has demonstrated leadership through her care contributions\n    And the community is recruiting for youth advisory board\n    When the community_elohim analyzes needs and capabilities\n    Then it should surface the opportunity to Jasmine\n    And explain why she's a good match: \"Your care contributions demonstrate the leadership they're seeking\"\n    And connect her care work to civic opportunities\n    And help her see pathways from care contribution to community leadership\n    And demonstrate that care economy participation opens doors\n    And recognize her capabilities rather than just her potential\n\n  Scenario: Teen volunteers recognized as substantial economic contribution\n    Given Jasmine volunteers 4 hours per week at community center\n    And this is 16 hours per month of skilled labor\n    When her volunteer work is tracked by community_elohim\n    Then it should be valued at appropriate care economy rates\n    And if professional childcare costs $15/hour, her care work should be valued accordingly\n    And her contribution of $240/month worth of care labor should be visible\n    And community institutions should recognize their dependence on her labor\n    And she should accumulate care tokens reflecting this substantial contribution\n    And the invisibility of teen volunteer labor should be corrected\n\n  Scenario: Teen builds professional relationships through community engagement\n    Given Jasmine volunteers at community center under director Marcus\n    And this relationship could support her future career\n    When she demonstrates capability and reliability over time\n    Then the community_elohim should track these professional relationship developments\n    And surface when relationships could support her goals\n    And help her understand that she's building professional networks\n    And recognize that community engagement creates social capital\n    And support her in developing adult professional relationships\n    And demonstrate that care economy participation builds career pathways\n\n  Scenario: Teen participates in community planning and decision-making\n    Given the community is planning a new youth recreation facility\n    And Jasmine has relevant knowledge as a current user of community spaces\n    When the community_elohim facilitates community input\n    Then Jasmine's voice should be actively solicited\n    And her input should carry weight in planning decisions\n    And her care contributions should give her standing in the conversation\n    And community planners should engage her as a legitimate stakeholder\n    And she should learn that civic participation is her right and responsibility\n    And youth voice should shape systems designed for collective flourishing\n\n  Scenario: Community supports teen's transition to adult independence\n    Given Jasmine is preparing for college and adult life\n    And she has accumulated care contributions and care tokens\n    When she needs support for transition to adulthood\n    Then the community_elohim should surface relevant resources\n    And her care tokens should be convertible to educational resources\n    And community institutions should support her based on demonstrated contribution\n    And mentorship, skill-building, and educational opportunities should be accessible\n    And the community should invest in her success as she invested in community wellbeing\n    And care economy should support intergenerational care and lifecycle transitions\n\n  Scenario: Teen coordinates care work across community contexts\n    Given Jasmine works part-time, volunteers, and contributes to family\n    And these contexts are all part of community care economy\n    When the community_elohim aggregates her contributions\n    Then all care work should be visible in integrated view\n    And she should see how her contributions connect across contexts\n    And understand that paid work, household labor, and volunteering are all care economy\n    And develop sophisticated understanding of how care creates value in multiple forms\n    And learn to manage complexity while maintaining coherent identity\n    And see herself as participating in integrated community care economy\n\n  Scenario: Community care economy prevents teen labor exploitation\n    Given Jasmine works part-time in retail\n    And young workers are vulnerable to exploitation\n    When her workplace conditions are monitored through community care economy\n    Then the community_elohim should track whether her labor is fairly compensated\n    And flag if work hours interfere with education or development\n    And recognize if workplace conditions become exploitative\n    And surface resources about worker rights and fair labor practices\n    And provide community support if she faces workplace problems\n    And demonstrate that care economy extends to protecting young workers\n\n  Scenario: Teen's civic engagement recognized as care contribution\n    Given Jasmine participates in community service projects\n    And she attends city council meetings about youth issues\n    When her civic engagement is tracked\n    Then it should be recognized as care work for the community\n    And political participation should be valued in care economy\n    And she should learn that civic engagement is care labor\n    And her generation should understand that democracy requires active care work\n    And community_elohim should make visible that youth civic participation matters\n    And her care tokens should reflect her contribution to democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Community provides safety net when teen faces crisis\n    Given Jasmine encounters a family crisis or household instability\n    And she has been a consistent community contributor\n    When the crisis occurs and she needs support\n    Then the community_elohim should surface available resources\n    And her care contributions should give her standing to access support\n    And community institutions should respond to protect her wellbeing\n    And the system should preserve her autonomy and dignity\n    And demonstrate that care economy operates as mutual aid\n    And show that communities care for members who have cared for community\n\n  Scenario: Teen contributes to community knowledge and improvement\n    Given Jasmine has insights about what works and doesn't work for teens\n    And she uses community services and programs\n    When the community seeks feedback about youth programs\n    Then her input should be actively sought and valued\n    And she should have voice in shaping community services\n    And the community_elohim should facilitate youth feedback to reach decision-makers\n    And her experience using systems should inform system improvement\n    And communities should recognize that users have valuable knowledge about how systems function\n    And teen voice should shape care economy design and implementation\n",
