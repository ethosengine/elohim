  "content": "Scenario: Parent care coordinated equitably with siblings\n    Given Robert's parents require increasing care support\n    And Robert has two siblings: Sarah and Michael\n    And care coordination across siblings is often fraught\n    When family_elohim coordinates sibling care contributions\n    Then it should track each sibling's care contributions\n    And make contributions visible to all siblings\n    And surface when distribution becomes inequitable\n    And facilitate discussion: \"Robert has handled 65% of medical coordination this quarter\"\n    And help siblings negotiate fair distribution based on capacity\n    And prevent resentment from invisible labor imbalances\n    And support siblings in maintaining relationships while coordinating care\n",
