  "content": "Scenario: Developer union relations become transparency issue\n    Given a developer has pattern of union-busting and labor resistance\n    And claims to support workers while fighting unionization\n    When the Observer documents labor relations history\n    Then analysis shows: developer spent $400K on union-busting consultants\n    And filed NLRB complaints against worker organizing attempts\n    And rhetoric about supporting workers contradicts anti-union actions\n    And labor relations pattern becomes visible to workers and community\n    And developers face accountability for anti-worker practices\n",
