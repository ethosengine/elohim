29Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, 30saying, \u2018This man began to build and was not able to finish.\u2019 31Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? 32And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace. 33So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.  \n\nStewardship and care for creation:  \nGenesis 2:15 \\- \"The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.\"  \nLoving neighbors and caring for the marginalized:  \nMatthew 22:39 \\- \"And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'\"  \nEthical frameworks and discernment:  \nPhilippians 1:9-10 \\- \"And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best...\"  \nRegenerative systems and restoration:  \nRevelation 21:5 \\- \"He who was seated on the throne said, 'I am making everything new\\!'\"  \nProphetic mindset and foresight:  \nAmos 3:7 \\- \"Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.\"  \nResponsible growth and collaborative community:  \n1 Corinthians 3:6-9 \\- \"I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow...\"  \nSelf-examination and accountability:  \nGalatians 6:4-5 \\- \"Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else...\"  \nPrayer and spiritual discernment:  \nJames 1:5 \\- \"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.\"  \nPatience and trust in God's timing:  \n2 Peter 3:8-9 \\- \"But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day...\"  \nPromoting justice, equality, and human dignity:  \nMicah 6:8 \\- \"He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.\"\n\n### Story \n\nThe story of Joseph interpreting Pharaoh's dreams and managing Egypt's resources in Genesis 41-47 provides an example of Minimizing Harmful Consequences in the bible:\n\n\"Joseph and the Seven Years of Plenty and Famine\"  \nIn this story:  \nPharaoh has dreams of seven fat cows being eaten by seven thin cows, and seven healthy ears of grain being devoured by seven thin ears.  \nJoseph interprets these dreams as a prediction of seven years of abundance followed by seven years of severe famine.  \nJoseph advises Pharaoh to appoint a wise manager to oversee the collection and storage of surplus grain during the seven years of plenty.  \nDuring the abundant years, Joseph implements a system to collect and store one-fifth of the harvest.  \nWhen the famine hits, Egypt is prepared and can provide for its people and even sell grain to neighboring regions.\n\nThis narrative illustrates:  \nExternalities: The future famine is an external factor that would have devastating consequences if not addressed.  \nTragedy of the Commons: Without Joseph's intervention, people might have consumed all the abundant crops, leaving nothing for the lean years \\- similar to overfishing a lake.  \nArms Race: While not explicitly an arms race, the story shows how preparation and wise resource management can prevent a destructive competition for scarce resources during the famine.  \nStewardship: Joseph's management demonstrates responsible stewardship of resources, considering long-term consequences and the common good.  \nProactive Problem-Solving: The story emphasizes the importance of recognizing potential future problems and taking action to mitigate them.\n\nThis biblical narrative can be used to discuss how foresight, wise management, and consideration of long-term consequences are crucial in technology development and use. It also demonstrates how addressing potential \"tragedies of the commons\" can benefit not just one group, but surrounding communities as well.\n\n### Discussion Question or Activity\n\nIdentifying Externalities Worksheet \n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs we conclude this first part of our exploration into minimizing harmful consequences, we're reminded of Joseph's wisdom in ancient Egypt.

Amen.\n\n### Application \n\n\\* We must see ourselves as Christans in a universal sense, if we are growing because other smaller congregations aren't as resourced are as capable as we are, or poaching from other christian communities, does not count toward growth as a body.   \n\\--As such, we should develop some ministry which seeks the development and success of other communities of christians, what we do well MUST be shared with the body, the full body, of Christ.  \n\\-- Church planting, building campaings, or relocating in such a way which chases and subsists primarly from our culture of suburban development needs to stop.   \n\n\\* We need to minimize the operational burdens of all \"infrastructure\" where we can, large buildings, debt-servicing, huge energy bills, transportation, health-care cost, risk-transfer.\n\n\\* We need a positive model for political discernment of the body which is judged by real measurable outcomes not lipservice to stated goals, we cannot be a community which serves the poor, prisoners, immigrants, orphans, and widows, while voting for a political representatives who impoverish, imprison, criminalize, orphan, and widow.  ( We cannot continue sinning, \\[or advocate for consequences\\], so that grace may abound )\n\n\\* Our lives must reflect our identity as christians,   \n\\--if we-members are working in industry that is generating externalities, we could dedicate capacity to helping people re-align their vocation with those values, without penalty or disruption.   \n\\--if we-members are living in such a way that is generating externalities (Parable of the Polygons), we should encourage people to make active choices and not rely on passive hope that someone will happen upon what a life well lived looks like. \n\n### Class Homework\n\nParable of the Polygons (ncase.me Simulation)  \nEvolution of Trust (ncase.me) \n\n### Other Media / Go Deeper / Class Maps\n\nInside Job \\- Financial Externalities  \nNo End In Sight \\- The High Cost of Political Externalities  \nWalmart \\- The High Cost of Low Price (Documentary)   \nJesus Camp \\-   \nHow Our Property Tax System Robs The Poor to Pay For The Wealthy  \n, Strong Towns, Youtube\n\nNot Just Bikes \\- Orange Pill  \nCar Centric Design   \nCarspiracy  \nFood Inc.  \nClimate Townn  \n\\- Water Usage in the US West  \n\\- Why Suburbs Suck  \nLet Grow \\- Leading the Movement for Childhood Independence  \nYour Yard Is EVIL \n\n\"Jesus Camp\" (2006), This documentary follows evangelical Christian children at a summer camp.  \nExternality: Diminished capacity for empathy and understanding towards those with different beliefs.  \nThis externality impacts Christians and the church by:  \nLimiting the ability to \"love your neighbor as yourself\" (Mark 12:31) when the \"neighbor\" holds different beliefs. Reducing the effectiveness of Christian witness by creating barriers to meaningful dialogue with non-believers. Potentially fostering a judgmental attitude that contradicts Jesus' teachings on love and acceptance. This externality hinders the church's ability to embody Christ's unconditional love by creating an \"us vs. them\" mentality, rather than seeing all people as equally worthy of God's love and grace.\n\n\"Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets\" (2023): This docuseries about the Duggar family and their involvement with the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP) also highlights several externalities:  \nAbuse and trauma: The series exposes how the teachings of IBLP created an environment where abuse could occur and be hidden, creating significant negative externalities for victims.  \nThis externality impacts Christians and the church by:  \nMaking it more difficult for genuine, loving Christian communities to reach those hurt by religious abuse.  \nPotentially causing some to reject faith altogether, limiting opportunities for sharing Christ's love.  \nCreating a barrier for the church to be seen as a place of healing and unconditional acceptance, as Jesus exemplified.  \nThis externality challenges the church's ability to be a reflection of Christ's unconditional love by associating Christianity with control and abuse rather than freedom and grace, contradicting Jesus' words in John 8:36, \"So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.\"  \nIn both cases, these externalities demonstrate how certain practices within Christian communities can unintentionally create obstacles to living out and sharing the unconditional love of Christ. They highlight the importance of constantly examining our methods and motivations against the standard of Jesus' life and teachings, ensuring that our actions produce fruit that aligns with God's love for all people."
