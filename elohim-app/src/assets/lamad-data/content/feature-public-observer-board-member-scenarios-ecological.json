Environmental and Planning Governance for Board Member\n  As a board member serving on planning commission or environmental board in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the ecological functional layer\n  I want independent environmental analysis and sustainability expertise\n  So that I can make informed decisions on development and environmental impacts despite lacking technical expertise\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the board_member user is registered in the system\n    And the ecological governance context is active\n    And I am a volunteer serving on planning commission, environmental commission, or conservation board\n\n  Scenario: Planning commissioner evaluates environmental impacts of large development\n    Given developer proposes major commercial development on vacant land\n    And environmental impact report prepared by developer's consultants\n    And staff recommendation supports approval with mitigation measures\n    When the planning commissioner requests Observer independent analysis\n    Then they receive assessment of impact report methodology and limitations\n    And see comparison to development impacts documented in peer jurisdictions\n    And access air quality, water, and habitat impact analysis independent of developer framing\n    And discover mitigation measures less effective than presented\n    And independent analysis reveals environmental impacts developer report minimized\n\n  Scenario: Parks commissioner learns accessible expertise on green infrastructure\n    Given parks department proposes converting traditional landscaping to green infrastructure\n    And proposal includes technical concepts like bioswales, permeable pavement, native plantings\n    And commissioner has no environmental engineering background but must approve plan\n    When the commissioner uses Observer accessible expertise\n    Then they receive plain-language explanation of green infrastructure approaches\n    And see examples from peer cities with implementation outcomes and costs\n    And access key questions to ask staff about maintenance and performance\n    And understand climate adaptation and water quality benefits\n    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment on technical proposal\n\n  Scenario: Planning commissioner tracks developer's environmental commitments from past project\n    Given same developer seeking approval for new project\n    And past project approved with environmental mitigation commitments\n    And commissioner wants to know if developer followed through on previous promises\n    When the commissioner uses Observer implementation tracking\n    Then they see developer's past project mitigation commitments versus implementation\n    And discover tree planting and habitat restoration commitments not fully delivered\n    And find stormwater management systems performing below promised levels\n    And access documentation showing enforcement gaps by municipality\n    And impact tracking reveals developer's track record diverged from promises\n\n  Scenario: Environmental commissioner evaluates watershed protection policy\n    Given commission considers strengthening regulations on development near waterways\n    And staff presents complex hydrology analysis and regulatory considerations\n    And development interests argue restrictions are excessive\n    When the commissioner requests Observer environmental policy analysis\n    Then they receive comparison of proposed protections to peer jurisdictions' standards\n    And see water quality trend data showing current protections insufficient\n    And access analysis of development impacts on downstream water quality\n    And get examples of how other communities balanced development and protection\n    And independent analysis helps commissioner evaluate competing claims\n\n  Scenario: Planning commissioner understands environmental justice dimensions of industrial permit\n    Given commission evaluates permit for industrial facility citing pollution\n    And facility meets regulatory standards according to staff analysis\n    And community members testify about existing pollution burden but lack data\n    When the commissioner seeks environmental justice analysis from Observer\n    Then they receive cumulative pollution exposure data for affected neighborhood\n    And see demographics showing low-income community of color already overburdened\n    And access health outcome data correlating with pollution exposure\n    And discover neighborhood has multiple polluting facilities unlike affluent areas\n    And environmental justice analysis reveals disparate impacts standard permitting ignores\n\n  Scenario: Conservation board member detects greenwashing in sustainability initiative\n    Given municipality proposes sustainability plan with ambitious climate goals\n    And plan emphasizes renewable energy targets and green building standards\n    And board wants to understand if plan will achieve meaningful emissions reductions\n    When the board member uses Observer sustainability analysis\n    Then they see plan's projected emissions reductions compared to climate science needs\n    And discover plan excludes transportation sector responsible for largest emissions\n    And find renewable energy targets rely on questionable carbon offset accounting\n    And access comparison to peer cities with more comprehensive climate action\n    And independent analysis distinguishes authentic sustainability from greenwashing\n\n  Scenario: Planning commissioner evaluates sprawl versus infill development trade-offs\n    Given commission faces pressure to approve suburban expansion development\n    And developers argue expansion provides affordable housing opportunities\n    And environmentalists advocate for urban infill to reduce sprawl\n    When the commissioner requests Observer growth pattern analysis\n    Then they receive comparison of infrastructure costs for sprawl versus infill\n    And see environmental impacts analysis including habitat, emissions, and water use\n    And access true affordability analysis accounting for transportation costs\n    And understand fiscal impacts on municipality over time\n    And accessible expertise helps commissioner evaluate complex growth trade-offs\n\n  Scenario: Environmental commissioner tracks city's climate action plan implementation\n    Given city adopted climate action plan with specific reduction targets and timelines\n    And annual progress reports from staff emphasize achievements\n    And commissioner wants objective assessment of whether city is on track\n    When the commissioner uses Observer accountability tracking\n    Then they see actual emissions reductions versus plan targets over time\n    And discover city is not on track to meet 2030 goals\n    And find some action items completed while highest-impact measures delayed\n    And access comparison showing peer cities making faster progress\n    And accountability tracking reveals gap between plan commitments and implementation\n\n  Scenario: Planning commissioner prepares for climate adaptation zoning update\n    Given commission must update zoning to address climate risks like flooding and heat\n    And staff proposes complex amendments addressing sea level rise and extreme weather\n    And commissioner wants to make informed decisions on technical requirements\n    When the commissioner uses Observer decision support\n    Then they receive executive summary of climate risks and proposed zoning responses\n    And see examples of climate adaptation zoning from vulnerable communities\n    And access analysis of which properties and populations most affected by requirements\n    And get questions to ask staff about implementation feasibility and equity\n    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment on climate adaptation policy\n",
