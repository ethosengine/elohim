  "content": "Scenario: Age-appropriate boundaries feel like safety not surveillance\n    Given Tommy's parents have configured family boundaries\n    And allergen restrictions are active (Emma's nut allergy)\n    And budget limits are set\n    And nutritional guidelines are configured\n    When Tommy attempts to select an item outside boundaries\n    Then the system should gently redirect without explicit restriction\n    And Tommy should experience boundaries as natural limits\n    And the personal_agent should explain in care terms: \"Let's find something Emma can safely eat\"\n    And Tommy should not feel surveilled or controlled\n    And his autonomy should remain genuine within safe parameters\n",
