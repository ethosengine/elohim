  "content": "Scenario: Analyzing Global Constitutional Convention deliberations\n    Given 10,000 randomly-selected global citizens convene every 7 years\n    And this is unprecedented experiment in planetary democracy\n    When I study the Global Constitutional Convention process\n    Then I examine: how citizens from radically different contexts deliberate together\n    And I analyze: what enables agreement despite profound disagreement\n    And I assess: quality of translation and cross-cultural understanding\n    And I explore: how amendments emerge from global collective wisdom\n    And I identify: power dynamics (Global North vs South, wealthy vs poor)\n    And I investigate: whether global sortition can produce legitimate law\n    And My research reveals: possibilities and limits of planetary democratic governance\n",
