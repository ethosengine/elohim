  "content": "Scenario: Retirement planning affected by grandparenting commitments\n    Given Margaret and Robert had retirement plans and dreams\n    And substantial grandparenting changes household capacity for travel and activities\n    When the household plans retirement lifestyle\n    Then the household_elohim should help balance care and retirement goals\n    And it should ensure grandparenting doesn't entirely subsume retirement plans\n    And it should help negotiate sustainable care arrangements\n    And both partners should be able to enjoy retirement\n    And household should maintain autonomy over retirement choices\n    And grandparenting should enhance rather than replace retirement\n",
