  "content": "Scenario: Analyzing technical expert influence on council decisions\n    Given councils rely on experts like Dr. Okonkwo for technical understanding\n    And I question whether experts dominate rather than inform\n    When I analyze correlation between expert testimony and council decisions\n    Then I examine: how often councils follow expert recommendations\n    And I identify: cases where councils override expert advice\n    And I assess: whether expert testimony quality predicts council confidence\n    And I explore: whether some experts influence more than others\n    And I investigate: warning signs of expert capture vs healthy advice\n    And My research reveals: whether technical-democratic balance is working\n    And Findings inform: expert testimony guidelines and council training\n",
