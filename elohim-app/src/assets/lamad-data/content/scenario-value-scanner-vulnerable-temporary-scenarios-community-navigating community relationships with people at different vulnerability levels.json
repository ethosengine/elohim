  "content": "Scenario: Navigating community relationships with people at different vulnerability levels\n    Given community includes people in various circumstances (crisis, stability, privilege)\n    And relationships cross different resource and vulnerability levels\n    When I interact with community members from different positions\n    Then the community_elohim facilitates cross-difference relationships\n    And validates that I am peer regardless of current circumstances\n    And helps me navigate power dynamics in community relationships\n    And prevents exploitation while enabling genuine connection\n    And recognizes that care economy includes people in various situations\n    And my personal_agent supports me in authentic relationships across difference\n    And tracks care economy participation beyond simplistic \"giver/receiver\" binary\n    And celebrates diverse community including vulnerable and privileged members\n",
