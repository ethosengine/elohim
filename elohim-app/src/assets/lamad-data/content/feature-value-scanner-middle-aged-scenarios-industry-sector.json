Industry/Sector Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult\n  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the industry/sector governance layer\n  I want to influence industry standards and practices based on care economy principles\n  So that my professional sector adopts care-friendly policies and recognizes care work as economically valuable\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the middle-aged user \"Robert\" is registered in the system\n    And Robert is 52 years old with decades of professional experience\n    And he works in management within his industry sector\n    And the industry governance context is active\n    And industry_elohim coordinates care economy advancement at sector level\n    And Robert has accumulated professional standing and industry connections\n\n  Scenario: Industry standards influenced toward care-friendly practices\n    Given Robert has professional standing in his industry\n    And industry standards affect millions of workers\n    And care-friendly standards would benefit workers across the sector\n    When industry_elohim connects Robert to standards development\n    Then it should identify opportunities to influence industry standards\n    And help him advocate for care leave, flexible work, and family support standards\n    And connect him to industry associations and standards bodies\n    And surface how care-friendly standards improve productivity and retention\n    And support him in leveraging professional position for sector transformation\n    And build industry practices that normalize care responsibilities\n    And demonstrate that industry standards can advance care economy\n\n  Scenario: Professional associations adopt care economy frameworks\n    Given Robert participates in professional associations\n    And professional associations shape industry norms and practices\n    And care economy principles should inform professional standards\n    When industry_elohim supports professional association engagement\n    Then it should help Robert advocate within professional associations\n    And support proposals for care economy professional development\n    And connect him with other care economy advocates in the profession\n    And help professional associations adopt care-friendly certification standards\n    And build professional identity that includes care economy principles\n    And advance care economy through professional credentialing\n    And demonstrate that all professions can integrate care economy\n\n  Scenario: Industry research and data collection includes care economy metrics\n    Given industry research shapes understanding of workforce needs\n    And care economy metrics are often missing from industry data\n    And better data would support care-friendly policy advocacy\n    When industry_elohim advocates for data collection\n    Then it should help Robert advocate for industry research on care economy\n    And support inclusion of caregiving metrics in workforce studies\n    And help industry understand impact of care responsibilities on productivity and retention\n    And provide data that supports care-friendly policy business case\n    And build industry knowledge base that includes care economy\n    And demonstrate that industry advancement requires care economy understanding\n    And create evidence base for sector transformation\n\n  Scenario: Sector-wide care leave and flexibility policies advocated\n    Given individual companies can be limited in policy innovation\n    And sector-wide policy creates competitive equity\n    And Robert's experience qualifies him to advocate\n    When industry_elohim supports sector policy advocacy\n    Then it should connect Robert to sector policy development processes\n    And help him advocate for industry-wide care leave standards\n    And support proposals for sector flexibility norms\n    And provide evidence about competitive advantage of care-friendly sectors\n    And build industry policy that supports all workers' care needs\n    And prevent individual companies from being penalized for care-friendly practices\n    And advance care economy at scale through sector transformation\n\n  Scenario: Industry education and training includes care economy content\n    Given professional development shapes industry practices\n    And care economy should be included in professional education\n    And Robert's experience qualifies him to contribute to education\n    When industry_elohim connects education and care economy\n    Then it should help Robert contribute to industry education development\n    And support inclusion of care economy in professional training\n    And help him develop case studies from lived experience\n    And build industry curriculum that includes care economy principles\n    And educate next generation of professionals in care economy thinking\n    And advance care economy through professional education\n    And demonstrate that industry knowledge should include care economy\n\n  Scenario: Cross-sector care economy collaboration facilitated\n    Given care economy affects all industry sectors\n    And cross-sector collaboration could advance shared goals\n    And Robert's professional networks span multiple sectors\n    When industry_elohim facilitates cross-sector collaboration\n    Then it should connect Robert with care economy advocates across sectors\n    And support development of cross-sector care economy initiatives\n    And help build coalitions for policy advocacy\n    And share best practices across industry boundaries\n    And build care economy movement that transcends sector divisions\n    And demonstrate that care economy is universal across industries\n    And advance transformation through cross-sector solidarity\n\n  Scenario: Industry compensation models value care contributions\n    Given traditional compensation often ignores care skills and contributions\n    And compensation models shape industry practice\n    And Robert's care skills enhance his professional value\n    When industry_elohim advocates for

economy\n    Given Robert approaches retirement years\n    And industry benefits often inadequately support caregivers\n    And retirement policy should recognize care contributions\n    When

develop retirement policy that values care economy participation\n    And build benefits frameworks that support multigenerational care\n    And advance industry benefits that recognize whole-person needs\n    And demonstrate that care economy should inform benefits design\n    And create industry practices that support lifecycle care needs\n\n  Scenario: Industry leadership diversity includes care economy advocates\n    Given industry leadership shapes sector culture and policy\n    And care economy advocates need representation in leadership\n    And Robert has accumulated experience and standing\n    When industry_elohim supports leadership advancement\n    Then it should help Robert pursue industry leadership positions\n    And recognize his care economy expertise as leadership qualification\n    And support him in bringing care economy perspective to leadership\n    And build industry leadership that includes caregivers and care economy advocates\n    And advance care economy through leadership representation\n    And demonstrate that care experience qualifies for industry leadership\n    And transform industry through leadership diversity\n\n  Scenario: Industry innovation includes care economy business models\n    Given industry innovation typically focuses on technology and efficiency\n    And care economy principles could inform business model innovation\n    And Robert's experience could contribute to innovation\n    When industry_elohim supports innovation advocacy\n    Then it should help Robert contribute to industry innovation discussions\n    And

advance industry transformation through innovation\n    And demonstrate that care economy enables competitive advantage\n    And create industry future based on care economy\n\n  Scenario: Industry accountability to care economy principles monitored\n    Given industries should be accountable to care economy principles\n    And industry practices often exploit rather than support care\n    And Robert can contribute to accountability advocacy\n    When industry_elohim monitors industry accountability\n    Then it should track industry performance on care economy metrics\n    And help Robert advocate for accountability mechanisms\n    And surface when industry practices harm caregivers\n    And support campaigns for industry reform\n    And build industry accountability to care economy principles\n    And demonstrate that industries should serve human flourishing\n    And advance care economy through accountability advocacy\n\n  Scenario: Industry knowledge networks spread care economy best practices\n    Given some organizations have developed care-friendly practices\n    And best practices should spread across the industry\n    And Robert's networks can facilitate knowledge sharing\n    When industry_elohim supports knowledge networks\n    Then it should connect Robert with industry care economy practitioners\n    And facilitate sharing of successful care economy practices\n    And help build industry knowledge about what works\n    And accelerate adoption through peer networks\n    And build industry capacity for care economy implementation\n    And demonstrate that practitioners can drive industry transformation\n    And advance care economy through knowledge sharing\n",
