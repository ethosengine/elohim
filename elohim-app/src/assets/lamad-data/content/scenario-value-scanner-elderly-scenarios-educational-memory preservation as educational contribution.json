  "content": "Scenario: Memory preservation as educational contribution\n    Given Helen holds family and community history\n    And dementia threatens loss of collective memory\n    When Helen participates in memory preservation projects\n    Then her storytelling should be captured for educational archives\n    And oral history should be treated as legitimate historical knowledge\n    And her participation should be recognized as educational contribution\n    And the protocol should prioritize preservation while Helen can still share\n    And cultural heritage should be maintained through elder participation\n    And Helen's memory keeping should be valued as community education\n    And historical knowledge should be preserved before it's lost\n",
