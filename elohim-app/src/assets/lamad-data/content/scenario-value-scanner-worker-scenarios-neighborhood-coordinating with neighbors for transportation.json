  "content": "Scenario: Coordinating with neighbors for transportation\n    Given I may not have reliable transportation\n    And neighbors might share rides or have vehicles available\n    When I need transportation for work, shopping, or other needs\n    Then the protocol should help coordinate neighborhood ride-sharing\n    And track reciprocal transportation support\n    And reduce individual costs through sharing\n    And build neighborhood care economy through mutual aid\n",
