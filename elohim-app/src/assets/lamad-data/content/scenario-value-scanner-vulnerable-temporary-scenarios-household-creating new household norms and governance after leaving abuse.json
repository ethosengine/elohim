  "content": "Scenario: Creating new household norms and governance after leaving abuse\n    Given my household previously operated under abusive dynamics\n    And I am rebuilding household culture based on safety and respect\n    When I establish new household rules and norms\n    Then the Value Scanner supports my authority as household decision-maker\n    And helps me create age-appropriate structures for children\n    And documents household agreements and expectations\n    And tracks what's working and what needs adjustment\n    And provides resources on healthy household dynamics\n    And my personal_agent reminds household members of established norms\n    And validates that rebuilding takes time and iteration\n    And recognizes my household governance work as valuable labor\n",
