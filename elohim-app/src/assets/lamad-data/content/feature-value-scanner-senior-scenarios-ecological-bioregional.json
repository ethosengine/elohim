Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Senior\n  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want my ecological knowledge to be valued and sustainability practices to be supported\n  So that senior wisdom about frugality and stewardship serves bioregional flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the senior user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret's generation has knowledge of waste reduction and resource conservation\n    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active\n    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates ecological care practices\n    And Margaret's frugality aligns with ecological sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Senior knowledge of waste reduction valued as ecological wisdom\n    Given Margaret's generation learned to minimize waste\n    And reducing waste is both budget necessity and ecological imperative\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks waste reduction practices\n    Then Margaret's waste minimization should be recognized\n    And her knowledge of using everything should be valued\n    And practices like saving containers, composting scraps should be tracked\n    And generational wisdom should inform community sustainability\n    And frugality should be reframed as ecological stewardship\n    And Margaret's practices should be teaching resource for younger generations\n\n  Scenario: Food preservation skills as bioregional care contribution\n    Given Margaret knows how to preserve food through canning, freezing, drying\n    And food preservation reduces waste and builds food security\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food preservation\n    Then Margaret's preservation labor should be quantified\n    And skills should be recognized as ecological care contribution\n    And preserved food reduces reliance on industrial food systems\n    And Margaret's knowledge should be shared with community\n    And traditional preservation techniques should be valued\n    And bioregional food resilience should be strengthened by senior knowledge\n\n  Scenario: Buying quality that lasts reduces ecological impact\n    Given Margaret learned to buy fewer, better things\n    And durability reduces waste and resource extraction\n    When Margaret makes purchasing decisions\n    Then her personal_agent should support quality-over-quantity choices\n    And the bioregional_elohim should track durability practices\n    And buying quality should be recognized as ecological stewardship\n    And Margaret's knowledge of durability should inform others\n    And consumption patterns should favor longevity\n    And throwaway culture should be countered by senior wisdom\n\n  Scenario: Seasonal eating patterns support bioregional food systems\n    Given Margaret shops for seasonal produce\n    And seasonal eating reduces food miles and supports local agriculture\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food choices\n    Then seasonal eating patterns should be recognized\n    And Margaret's choices should support bioregional food systems\n    And local, seasonal food should be prioritized in recommendations\n    And eating with seasons should be encouraged and facilitated\n    And bioregional awareness should develop through practice\n    And Margaret's food choices should strengthen local food economy\n\n  Scenario: Garden and food growing knowledge shared across generations\n    Given Margaret may grow some of her own food\n    And gardening knowledge is both ecological and practical\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates food growing\n    Then Margaret's gardening should be recognized as care contribution\n    And growing food reduces industrial agriculture dependence\n    And her knowledge should be shared with neighbors and family\n    And community gardens should connect seniors with others\n    And food growing should be supported as ecological practice\n    And Margaret's skills should strengthen community food security\n\n  Scenario: Repair and mending skills reduce waste\n    Given Margaret knows how to repair clothing, household items, equipment\n    And repair culture counters disposability\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks repair practices\n    Then Margaret's mending and repair should be recognized\n    And skills should be valued as ecological care contribution\n    And repair knowledge should be shared with younger generations\n    And community repair culture should be strengthened\n    And disposability should be countered by repair practices\n    And Margaret's skills should serve bioregional sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Bulk buying and package reduction practices\n    Given Margaret learned to buy bulk to reduce packaging\n    And package reduction serves both budget and ecology\n    When Margaret shops with minimal packaging\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should track packaging reduction\n    And bulk buying should be recognized as ecological practice\n    And Margaret's practices should inform community purchasing\n    And package waste should be minimized\n    And bioregional resource flows should be optimized\n    And frugality should align with ecological goals\n\n  Scenario: Walking and public transit use reduces carbon footprint\n    Given Margaret can no longer afford car ownership\n    And walking/transit use serves ecological goals\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks transportation patterns\n    Then Margaret's low-carbon mobility should be recognized\n    And walking should be valued as ecological choice\n    And public transit use should be supported and facilitated\n    And her mobility patterns should serve bioregional sustainability\n    And car-free living should be honored as ecological stewardship\n    And economic constraint should be reframed as ecological virtue\n\n  Scenario: Teaching younger generations about resource conservation\n    Given Margaret has decades of conservation knowledge\n    And younger generations need sustainable living skills\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates knowledge sharing\n    Then Margaret should teach conservation practices\n    And her knowledge should be transmitted to younger people\n    And teaching should be recognized as ecological care contribution\n    And intergenerational knowledge transfer should strengthen sustainability\n    And senior wisdom should inform bioregional practices\n    And ecological education should flow from elder experience\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional food knowledge and local food traditions\n    Given Margaret knows local food traditions and seasonal patterns\n    And bioregional food culture strengthens local systems\n    When the bioregional_elohim supports food culture\n    Then Margaret's knowledge of local foods should be valued\n    And traditional food practices should be preserved and shared\n    And local food culture should be taught to younger generations\n    And bioregional identity should be strengthened through food\n    And Margaret's cultural food knowledge should serve community\n    And food traditions should connect people to place\n\n  Scenario: Foraging and wild food knowledge\n    Given Margaret may know local wild and foraged foods\n    And foraging connects people to bioregion and reduces food costs\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates wild food knowledge\n    Then Margaret's foraging knowledge should be recognized\n    And safe foraging practices should be shared\n    And wild food resources should be sustainably utilized\n    And bioregional food diversity should be enhanced\n    And Margaret's knowledge should strengthen food security\n    And connection to land should be deepened through foraging\n\n  Scenario: Climate adaptation knowledge from lived experience\n    Given Margaret has observed environmental changes over decades\n    And adaptation requires long-term observation\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates climate adaptation\n    Then Margaret's observations should inform adaptation strategies\n    And her knowledge of changing patterns should be valued\n    And long-term perspective should shape bioregional planning\n    And senior experience should guide community resilience\n    And climate adaptation should benefit from elder wisdom\n    And Margaret's lifetime of observation should serve collective response\n",
