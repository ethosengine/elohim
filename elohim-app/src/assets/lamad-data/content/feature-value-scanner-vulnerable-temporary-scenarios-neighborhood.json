  "content": "Feature: Neighborhood Integration and Local Resource Access During Temporary Vulnerability\n  As a person in temporary housing navigating crisis\n  I want to build neighborhood connections and access local resources\n  So that I can create stability and support in my current location regardless of housing permanence\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am living in transitional

contributions (childcare exchanges, skill sharing, information sharing)\n    And facilitates reciprocal care relationships in neighborhood\n    And tracks my care economy participation with care

neighborhood resources require travel\n    When I need to access services across the neighborhood\n    Then the Value Scanner optimizes my travel for efficiency\n    And identifies services accessible by walking or public transit\n    And helps me batch errands to minimize trips\n    And surfaces transportation assistance programs\n    And coordinates with neighbors for ride-sharing when
