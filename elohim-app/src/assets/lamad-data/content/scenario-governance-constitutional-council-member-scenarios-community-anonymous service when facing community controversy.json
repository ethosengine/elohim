  "content": "Scenario: Anonymous service when facing community controversy\n    Given I am reviewing a highly controversial local case\n    And I am concerned about community pressure or retaliation\n    When I request anonymous service protections\n    Then my identity is: revealed only to verification systems\n    And I can: serve without public knowing who I am\n    And I am protected: from intimidation or capture attempts\n    And I can: deliberate freely without fear\n    And cryptographic proofs: verify I'm legitimate member without revealing identity\n    And my judgment: maintains democratic legitimacy despite anonymity\n",
