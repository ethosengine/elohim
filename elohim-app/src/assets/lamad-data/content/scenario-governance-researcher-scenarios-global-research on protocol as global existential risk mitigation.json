  "content": "Scenario: Research on protocol as global existential risk mitigation\n    Given superintelligent AI poses existential risk to humanity\n    And I study whether democratic governance can address this risk\n    When I analyze protocol as existential risk mitigation strategy\n    Then I examine: whether constitutional accountability reduces AI risk\n    And I assess: whether sortition prevents elite capture of superintelligence\n    And I explore: whether transparency enables democratic oversight at scale\n    And I analyze: whether recourse mechanisms provide adaptation to unknown risks\n    And I investigate: whether protocol's distributed architecture increases resilience\n    And I conclude: honestly about uncertainties and limitations\n    And My research informs: humanity's response to its most important challenge\n",
