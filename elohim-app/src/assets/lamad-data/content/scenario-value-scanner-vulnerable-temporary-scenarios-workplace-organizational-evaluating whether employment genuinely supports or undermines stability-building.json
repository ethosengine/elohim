  "content": "Scenario: Evaluating whether employment genuinely supports or undermines stability-building\n    Given some employment could undermine rather than support my rebuilding\n    And I need work that enables rather than prevents stability\n    When I evaluate employment opportunities holistically\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me assess total impact of employment\n    And considers financial benefit, schedule compatibility, stress level, childcare impact, recovery support\n    And validates that employment should improve my situation, not worsen it\n    And helps me identify when employment costs more (financially, emotionally, practically) than it provides\n    And my personal_agent evaluates opportunities against my whole situation\n    And recognizes that not all employment serves vulnerable people\n    And supports me declining employment that would harm my rebuilding\n",
