  "content": "Scenario: Appeal mental health intervention with privacy concerns\n    Given my Family Elohim has alerted my partner about concerning behavioral changes\n    And I believe this is an invasion of my privacy\n    And I was not in immediate danger\n    When I file an appeal through my interface\n    And I state my complaint in my own words: \"This felt like surveillance\"\n    Then the appeal is immediately logged with timestamp and cryptographic proof\n    And I receive confirmation with appeal tracking number\n    And the agent provides its full reasoning transparently\n    And I can see the pattern detection logic, confidence levels, and constitutional weighting\n    And the appeal is scheduled for Community Elohim review within 24 hours\n    And I am notified of my rights including escalation options\n",
