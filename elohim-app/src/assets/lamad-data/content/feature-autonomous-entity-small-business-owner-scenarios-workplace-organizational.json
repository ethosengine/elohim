Democratic Transition and Knowledge Transfer for Small Business Owner\n  As a small_business_owner in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer\n  I want to facilitate workers' transition to democratic ownership with dignity\n  So that my legacy becomes community institution and workers gain autonomy\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Rosa has accepted EAE acquisition of Rosa's Auto Repair\n    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active\n    And Rosa has chosen the two-year transition steward role\n\n  Scenario: Owner systematically transfers tacit business knowledge to workers\n    Given Rosa has 15 years of operational expertise workers need to succeed\n    And her knowledge includes supplier relationships, customer preferences, and workflow optimization\n    When workplace_elohim initiates knowledge transfer protocols\n    Then Rosa participates in documented teaching sessions covering key business areas\n    And her expertise is captured through video demonstrations and written guides\n    And workers learn bookkeeping, supplier negotiation, and customer relations\n    And relationship maps show supplier and customer networks with context\n    And knowledge becomes institutional memory, not dependent on Rosa's presence\n\n  Scenario: Workers gradually assume democratic governance responsibilities\n    Given Rosa previously made all strategic business decisions alone\n    And workers need to develop governance capacity and confidence\n    When democratic transition timeline begins\n    Then early phase: Rosa proposes decisions, workers approve and learn rationale\n    And middle phase: workers propose decisions, Rosa advises and supports\n    And late phase: workers decide democratically, Rosa consults only when requested\n    And workplace_elohim tracks governance capacity growth over transition period\n    And power genuinely transfers without hierarchical recapture\n\n  Scenario: Business operations maintain continuity during ownership transition\n    Given customers depend on reliable auto repair service\n    And continuity protects both community institution and workers' livelihoods\n    When ownership structure transforms from individual to democratic\n    Then customer relationships are systematically introduced to workers as new decision-makers\n    And service quality remains consistent through documented procedures\n    And supplier relationships transfer with Rosa introducing workers personally\n    And equipment maintenance knowledge is shared and documented\n    And no disruption occurs to daily operations or customer service\n\n  Scenario: Former owner role evolves from command to facilitation\n    Given Rosa was sole decision-maker carrying full responsibility\n    And transition steward role requires fundamentally different skills\n    When Rosa begins facilitating rather than commanding\n    Then her proposals become suggestions workers can accept or modify\n    And her expertise is valued through consultation, not authority\n    And conflicts are resolved through democratic process, not owner decree\n    And workers request her input because it's helpful, not because it's mandated\n    And workplace_elohim ensures boundaries prevent hierarchical creep\n\n  Scenario: Workers develop confidence in collective decision-making\n    Given workers have never governed a business democratically\n    And they may doubt their capability initially\n    When early democratic decisions succeed\n    Then workers see their collective wisdom produces good outcomes\n    And small decisions (schedule adjustments, supply orders) build confidence\n    And larger decisions (pricing strategy, service expansion) follow as capacity grows\n    And workplace_elohim documents successful democratic decision patterns\n    And worker self-governance becomes normalized, not exceptional\n\n  Scenario: Owner processes identity shift from sole owner to transition supporter\n    Given Rosa's identity was tied to business ownership for 15 years\n    And letting go triggers real grief and identity crisis\n    When EAE provides transition support including peer counseling\n    Then Rosa accesses support groups with other converted owners\n    And she processes ownership loss with validation and care\n    And new identity emerges: founder who chose community over extraction\n    And her purpose shifts from ownership burden to legacy stewardship\n    And emotional reality is honored throughout transition\n\n  Scenario: Business adapts to worker priorities through democratic governance\n    Given Rosa's priorities as owner shaped business direction\n    And workers' priorities may differ in important ways\n    When workers gain governance voice during transition\n    Then schedule flexibility increases based on workers' family needs\n    And service offerings adapt to worker expertise and interests\n    And workplace improvements workers suggested previously get implemented\n    And compensation equity is addressed through democratic value distribution\n    And business becomes genuinely responsive to worker flourishing, not just profit\n\n  Scenario: Transition steward compensation reflects expertise without recreating extraction\n    Given Rosa receives $55K annually for coordination and knowledge transfer\n    And this must be fair without enabling exploitation\n    When steward compensation is evaluated democratically\n    Then workers verify Rosa's salary is justified by coordination value\n    And compensation is transparent and subject to democratic approval\n    And Rosa cannot use steward role to reclaim ownership control\n    And after two years, role ends with clear transition to worker autonomy\n    And workplace_elohim monitors to prevent steward role from becoming new hierarchy\n\n  Scenario: Customer relationships institutionalize beyond individual owner\n    Given Rosa built customer loyalty through personal trust over 15 years\n    And these relationships are valuable but currently dependent on her\n    When customer relationship transition process begins\n    Then Rosa introduces workers to customers as new business leaders\n    And customer histories are documented (with privacy protection)\n    And workers learn customer preferences and build direct relationships\n    And customers discover democratic ownership often deepens their loyalty\n    And relationships survive and strengthen beyond Rosa's involvement\n\n  Scenario: Supplier networks transfer to democratic worker management\n    Given Rosa negotiated with parts suppliers and built distributor relationships\n    And these networks are essential for business operations\n    When supplier relationship transition occurs\n    Then Rosa introduces workers to her supplier contacts personally\n    And relationship trust transfers through Rosa's endorsement\n    And workers learn negotiation strategies and supplier quality assessment\n    And EAE network provides volume purchasing power Rosa never had\n    And supplier relationships professionalize under democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Equipment and facilities knowledge prevents operational failures\n    Given Rosa knows every quirk of equipment and building systems\n    And this tacit knowledge prevents costly breakdowns and delays\n    When facilities knowledge transfer is prioritized\n    Then Rosa documents equipment maintenance schedules and troubleshooting\n    And workers learn which compressor sounds indicate problems\n    And building system knowledge (electrical, plumbing, HVAC) is shared\n    And maintenance protocols are established preventing future failures\n    And institutional knowledge replaces individual expertise\n\n  Scenario: Owner exits gracefully with community gratitude after transition completes\n    Given Rosa has completed two-year transition steward commitment\n    And workers are confidently governing the business democratically\n    When Rosa's transition steward role concludes\n    Then workers celebrate her choice to enable democratic ownership\n    And community honors her as founder who chose workers over individual wealth\n    And Rosa exits with consulting income and profound sense of legacy preserved\n    And business continues thriving under worker governance\n    And workplace_elohim documents successful transition as model for future conversions\n",
