  "content": "Scenario: Participating in neighborhood mutual aid despite time limits\n    Given my neighborhood has mutual aid networks\n    And I have minimal time due to work demands\n    When I want to participate in neighborhood care economy\n    Then the protocol should identify micro-opportunities for contribution\n    And help me participate in ways that fit my schedule\n    And recognize that small contributions matter\n    And connect me to neighborhood resources when I need support\n",
