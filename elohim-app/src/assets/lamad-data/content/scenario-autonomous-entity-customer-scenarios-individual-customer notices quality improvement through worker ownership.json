  "content": "Scenario: Customer notices quality improvement through worker ownership\n    Given corporate model pressured quality cuts for profit maximization\n    And Ms. Johnson accepted mediocre quality as inevitable for fast food\n    When worker ownership aligns incentives with quality\n    Then food tastes better because workers care about product they own\n    And vegetables are fresh (from Johnson Farm, not corporate distributor)\n    And cleanliness improves through worker pride in ownership\n    And quality exceeds previous corporate standards while prices remain affordable\n    And community_elohim documents quality improvements for customer awareness\n",
