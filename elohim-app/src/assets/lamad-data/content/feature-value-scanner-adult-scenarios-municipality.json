Municipal Layer Value Recognition for Adult\n  As an adult engaging with municipal governance\n  Operating at the municipal governance layer\n  I want my care contributions to influence public policy\n  So that municipal systems recognize and support care economy at scale\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the adult user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah lives in a municipality that recognizes care economy\n    And the municipal governance context is active\n    And the municipal_elohim coordinates city-level care economy\n    And Sarah's accumulated care contributions are tracked\n\n  Scenario: Municipal policy informed by aggregated care economy data\n    Given thousands of residents participate in care economy\n    And their care patterns generate valuable data\n    When municipal policy decisions are made\n    Then the municipal_elohim should provide aggregated care work data\n    And policy makers should see actual patterns of care labor\n    And invisible care work should be quantified at municipal scale\n    And policy should be informed by real care economy patterns\n    And data should reveal needs that traditional economics miss\n\n  Scenario: Sarah's care contributions give her voice in municipal decisions\n    Given Sarah has accumulated substantial care tokens through community work\n    And municipal governance affects her family's well-being\n    When municipal decisions are being made\n    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her legitimate standing\n    And her voice should carry weight based on demonstrated care\n    And municipal democracy should recognize care work as civic participation\n    And those who contribute to community should influence community governance\n    And care economy should create accountable municipal leadership\n\n  Scenario: Municipal school policy shaped by parent care work advocacy\n    Given Sarah works as teacher and is parent advocate\n    And she has deep knowledge of educational needs\n    When municipal school policy is debated\n    Then Sarah's professional and parent care work should be recognized\n    And her advocacy should be informed by care economy data\n    And school policy should reflect actual parent and educator experiences\n    And care economy should strengthen parent voice in education policy\n    And municipal education should benefit from care worker input\n\n  Scenario: Municipal food security programs integrate with care economy\n    Given municipal food assistance programs exist\n    And many residents participate in care economy food cooperatives\n    When municipal food security is addressed\n    Then the municipal_elohim should coordinate with existing programs\n    And care economy food cooperatives should receive municipal support\n    And care tokens should integrate with food assistance\n    And municipal food policy should recognize cooperative models\n    And care economy should enhance, not replace, public food security\n\n  Scenario: Municipal care token supplements support low-income families\n    Given Sarah's household income is $65k/year\n    And many families have less economic resources\n    When municipal care economy operates\n    Then care token supplements should be available based on income\n    And the Value Scanner should be accessible regardless of ability to pay\n    And municipal subsidies should ensure universal access\n    And care economy should function as economic support system\n    And access should be dignified and universal\n\n  Scenario: Municipal working parent policies informed by care economy data\n    Given Sarah balances full-time work with parenting\n    And municipal policy affects working parents' capacity to care\n    When municipal employment policies are considered\n    Then care economy data should show working parents' time constraints\n    And policy should recognize workers' care responsibilities\n    And municipal employers should adopt family-friendly policies\n    And Sarah's advocacy should be strengthened by care economy evidence\n    And municipal policy should support work-life integration\n\n  Scenario: Municipal resource allocation reflects care economy contributions\n    Given Sarah and others contribute substantially to community care\n    And municipal budgets allocate significant resources\n    When municipal budgets are decided\n    Then care economy contributions should be visible to decision makers\n    And resource allocation should recognize care creates value\n    And neighborhoods with strong care economy should receive support\n    And municipal investment should strengthen care economy infrastructure\n    And budgets should reflect that care work is economically valuable\n\n  Scenario: Municipal crisis response coordinates with care economy networks\n    Given municipal emergency management systems exist\n    And care economy has created mutual aid networks\n    When municipal crises occur (natural disasters, economic shocks, health emergencies)\n    Then the municipal_elohim should coordinate with emergency response\n    And existing care networks should be activated for crisis support\n    And municipal response should leverage community care capacity\n    And care economy should strengthen municipal resilience\n    And crisis response should be more effective through coordination\n\n  Scenario: Municipal data privacy protects residents while enabling planning\n    Given municipal care economy involves data about many residents\n    And privacy must be rigorously protected\n    When municipal planning uses care economy data\n    Then the municipal_elohim should only provide aggregated anonymized data\n    And no individual household should be identifiable\n    And Sarah's privacy should be absolute unless she chooses disclosure\n    And municipal benefits should not require privacy sacrifice\n    And data governance should be transparent and accountable\n\n  Scenario: Municipal care economy connects to regional and state levels\n    Given Sarah's municipality successfully implements care economy\n    And larger governance scales could benefit from similar approaches\n    When municipal care economy is established\n    Then the municipal_elohim should connect to regional systems\n    And successful municipal practices should inform state policy\n    And care economy should scale beyond municipal boundaries\n    And Sarah's local success should contribute to broader transformation\n    And municipal level should be stepping stone to larger scale change\n\n  Scenario: Municipal civic engagement increased through care economy participation\n    Given Sarah participates actively in municipal care economy\n    And civic engagement is strengthened by care work recognition\n    When municipal civic participation is measured\n    Then care economy participants should show higher engagement\n    And Sarah's care work should connect her to civic processes\n    And municipal democracy should be strengthened by care economy\n    And voter participation should increase among care economy members\n    And care creates civic engagement, not just economic value\n\n  Scenario: Municipal economic development includes care economy\n    Given traditional economic development ignores care work\n    And Sarah's care contributions create substantial value\n    When municipal economic development is planned\n    Then care economy should be recognized as economic sector\n    And care work should be counted in municipal GDP calculations\n    And economic development should support care economy infrastructure\n    And municipal prosperity should reflect care creates value\n    And economic planning should include invisible care labor\n\n  Scenario: Municipal policy experimentation enabled by care economy data\n    Given Sarah's municipality has care economy data unavailable elsewhere\n    And this data enables evidence-based policy innovation\n    When municipal government considers new policies\n    Then care economy data should enable experimentation\n    And policy innovations should be tested with evidence\n    And Sarah's municipality should lead in care economy policy\n    And successful experiments should be shared with other municipalities\n    And care economy should drive progressive municipal governance\n",
