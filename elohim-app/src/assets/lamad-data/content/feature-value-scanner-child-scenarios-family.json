Family Layer Value Recognition for Child\n  As a child in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want to be recognized as a junior contributor to family flourishing\n  So that I experience my role shifting from dependent to capable family member\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the child user \"Emma\" is registered in the system\n    And Emma is 8 years old\n    And Emma is part of a family unit with parent Sarah and brother Tommy (5)\n    And the family household income is $40,000/year\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim is coordinating family care economy\n    And Emma's personal_agent communicates with family_elohim\n\n  Scenario: Child's substantive care contributions visible to family\n    Given Emma has made budget-conscious cereal choice\n    And she selected store brand to save $2\n    When the family_elohim processes the contribution\n    Then Emma's stewardship should be visible on family dashboard\n    And parent Sarah should receive specific recognition prompts\n    And the prompt should highlight Emma's economic reasoning\n    And the contribution should be attributed with concrete impact\n    And family care tokens should reflect genuine value created\n    And visibility should enable meaningful parental acknowledgment\n\n  Scenario: Shifting from dependent to junior contributor role\n    Given Emma has increasing capability at age 8\n    And her family role is evolving\n    When Emma makes care contributions through the scanner\n    Then she should be recognized as junior contributor, not just helper\n    And her voice in family decisions should carry real weight\n    And the family_elohim should track her growing capability\n    And Sarah should be supported in granting appropriate autonomy\n    And Emma should experience increasing responsibility\n    And family dynamics should reflect her developmental transition\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating care work with younger sibling\n    Given Emma's brother Tommy is 5 years old\n    And Emma sometimes helps Tommy make choices\n    When Emma assists Tommy in the Value Scanner\n    Then her teaching and support should be recognized as care work\n    And the family_elohim should track sibling care patterns\n    And Emma should learn that helping others is valuable contribution\n    And Tommy should benefit from Emma's greater capability\n    And cross-generational care should be made visible\n    And Emma should build identity as both care receiver and care provider\n\n  Scenario: Family budget constraints shape real economic learning\n    Given the family income is $40,000/year\n    And Emma is learning genuine resource constraint\n    When Emma makes purchasing decisions\n    Then her personal_agent should provide real budget information\n    And the agent should say \"We have $30 left for groceries this week\"\n    And Emma should experience actual financial limits\n    And her choices should have real impact on family resources\n    And she should learn stewardship through authentic constraint\n    And economic education should reflect family's actual circumstances\n\n  Scenario: Child influences family values while family shapes child\n    Given Emma is forming her own values at age 8\n    And family values still primarily guide her\n    When Emma suggests trying new products or priorities\n    Then the family_elohim should track her value proposals\n    And Sarah should receive prompts to consider Emma's input\n    And Emma's voice should genuinely influence family decisions\n    And bidirectional value formation should occur\n    And Emma should experience being heard in family governance\n    And family culture should evolve with children's input\n\n  Scenario: Earning increased autonomy through demonstrated stewardship\n    Given Emma has shown good judgment over time\n    And parents can adjust boundaries through family_elohim\n    When Emma's decision patterns demonstrate capability\n    Then Sarah should be prompted to expand Emma's freedom\n    And specific areas for increased autonomy should be suggested\n    And Emma should understand connection between responsibility and freedom\n    And the family should have clear process for granting trust\n    And autonomy should be earned through demonstrated care\n    And family governance should respond to growing capability\n\n  Scenario: Family care token economy includes child contributions\n    Given the family participates in care token system\n    And Emma makes multiple types of care contributions\n    When family care tokens are calculated weekly\n    Then Emma's economic decisions should generate tokens\n    And her care for Tommy should be valued\n    And her household contributions should be recognized\n    And tokens should reflect genuine value created\n    And Emma should have age-appropriate awareness of her economic impact\n    And care token distribution should teach that care creates value\n\n  Scenario: Sibling care relationships built through mutual recognition\n    Given Emma cares for Tommy and Tommy cares for Emma\n    And both children make care contributions\n    When the family_elohim tracks sibling interactions\n    Then reciprocal care patterns should be highlighted\n    And Emma should be prompted to recognize Tommy's care for her\n    And Tommy should be prompted to recognize Emma's help\n    And the family should see mutual care, not hierarchy\n    And positive feedback loops should strengthen sibling bonds\n    And care economy should build family relationships\n\n  Scenario: Parental oversight balances with expanding child autonomy\n    Given Emma has more freedom than Tommy\n    And she still needs parental guidance at age 8\n    When Emma makes independent scanner decisions\n    Then Sarah should have full visibility into Emma's choices\n    And Sarah should maintain ultimate authority\n    And Emma's autonomy should be genuine within parental bounds\n    And the balance should protect both safety and capability development\n    And Sarah should be supported in letting go appropriately\n    And trust should grow as Emma demonstrates judgment\n\n  Scenario: Family shopping as collaborative care experience\n    Given Emma and Sarah shop together\n    And they both use the Value Scanner\n    When they coordinate on family purchasing decisions\n    Then Emma should be learning from Sarah's modeling\n    And Sarah should be teaching through real decision-making\n    And the family_elohim should coordinate their different roles\n    And Emma's contributions should be recognized alongside Sarah's\n    And shopping should be experienced as family care work\n    And collaborative decision-making should strengthen relationship\n\n  Scenario: Child's care work saves family money with real impact\n    Given the family has tight budget constraints\n    And Emma chooses cost-effective options consistently\n    When Emma's choices accumulate over time\n    Then actual savings should be calculated and visible\n    And Emma should see concrete impact: \"Your choices saved $47 this month\"\n    And the family should be able to allocate savings to other needs\n    And Emma's stewardship should have measurable benefit\n    And economic contribution should be recognized as genuine help\n    And she should understand her agency affects family flourishing\n\n  Scenario: Family cultural values shape child's economic reasoning\n    Given Emma's family has specific cultural framework\n    And these values are configured in family_elohim\n    When Emma makes value decisions\n    Then guidance should align with family cultural context\n    And her personal_agent should reinforce family values\n    And economic literacy should be culturally appropriate\n    And the protocol should serve family's chosen framework\n    And diverse family cultures should be respected\n    And value formation should honor family identity\n",
