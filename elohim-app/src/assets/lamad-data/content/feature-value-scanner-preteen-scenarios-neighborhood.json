community gives care (support)\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate these exchanges\n    And dignity should be preserved through reciprocity framework\n\n  Scenario: Multi-store price comparison supports budget optimization\n    Given Marcus has limited budget and multiple store options\n    And different stores have different prices for same items\n    When Marcus plans his shopping across stores\n    Then the personal_agent should provide multi-store price comparison\n    And it should aggregate data from neighborhood stores\n    And it should optimize shopping list across locations\n    And it should help Marcus get best value from his $75 budget\n    And neighborhood-scale data should reduce his individual burden\n    And collective price intelligence should benefit all families\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces household costs\n    Given many families have similar needs\n    And resource sharing could reduce individual costs\n    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies sharing opportunities\n    Then Marcus's family should be connected to sharing networks\n    And bulk buying cooperatives should be suggested\n    And tool libraries and resource sharing should be facilitated\n    And neighborhood coordination should stretch Marcus's budget further\n    And collective consumption should reduce individual scarcity\n    And care economy should operate at neighborhood scale\n\n  Scenario: Safety through neighborhood awareness and care\n    Given Marcus is a 12-year-old shopping independently\n    And neighborhood safety is important for his autonomy\n    When Marcus moves through his neighborhood\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate informal care networks\n    And local adults should be aware of children shopping independently\n    And community care should provide informal oversight\n    And Marcus should be safer through neighborhood relationships\n    And his independence should be supported by community awareness\n    And the protocol should build village-scale child protection\n\n  Scenario: Identifying food waste reduction opportunities at neighborhood scale\n    Given Marcus must maximize value from limited budget\n    And food waste represents lost resources\n    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies waste patterns\n    Then it should connect Marcus to gleaning opportunities\n    And it should facilitate food rescue programs\n    And it should help him access surplus food from stores\n    And neighborhood coordination should reduce waste while addressing need\n    And Marcus's family should benefit from systematic waste reduction\n    And ecological and economic goals should align\n\n  Scenario: Seasonal and local food availability at neighborhood level\n    Given Marcus shops in specific geographic area\n    And seasonal local food is often cheaper\n    When Marcus plans meals\n    Then the personal_agent should highlight seasonal local options\n    And it should show what's available from neighborhood sources\n    And it should help him find affordable local produce\n    And neighborhood farmers' markets should be integrated\n    And local food systems should benefit Marcus's budget\n    And bioregional awareness should develop through practice\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood solidarity in resource scarcity\n    Given Marcus's family faces economic constraints\n    And other neighborhood families have similar struggles\n    When neighborhood care patterns are visible\n    Then Marcus should understand his family is not alone\n    And collective challenges should be visible at neighborhood scale\n    And solidarity should develop among families facing scarcity\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate mutual support\n    And isolation should be reduced through shared understanding\n    And political consciousness about systemic issues should begin to form\n\n  Scenario: Privacy preserved while participating in neighborhood networks\n    Given Marcus's household circumstances are sensitive\n    And participation in neighborhood networks requires some visibility\n    When Marcus's data contributes to neighborhood coordination\n    Then his specific situation must remain private\n    And only anonymized aggregate data should be used\n    And neighborhood support should flow without stigmatizing exposure\n    And his dignity should be protected while receiving benefits\n    And privacy should be balanced with community participation\n    And the protocol should enable solidarity without surveillance\n",
