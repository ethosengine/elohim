Individual Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent\n  As a grandparent providing substantial care work across generations\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want my autonomy, identity, and care contributions to be recognized\n  So that my grandparenting is valued as sophisticated work, not just leisure\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the grandparent user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret is 68 years old, retired from nursing\n    And Margaret provides 25 hours/week childcare for grandchildren\n    And Margaret also cares for her 92-year-old mother\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Margaret's personal_agent is configured for dignity and autonomy\n    And the interface is optimized for accessibility needs\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent preserves Margaret's identity beyond grandparenting\n    Given Margaret has her own interests, friendships, and development goals\n    And she is not defined solely by caregiving roles\n    When Margaret's personal_agent tracks her activities\n    Then it should recognize time spent on her own hobbies and interests\n    And it should encourage balance between caregiving and personal growth\n    And it should protect space for Margaret's continued development\n    And it should affirm that her value extends beyond utility\n    And Margaret should experience herself as a whole person\n    And the system should prevent her identity collapse into \"just grandma\"\n    And her autonomy and personhood should be continuously affirmed\n\n  Scenario: Accessible interface accommodates aging-related needs without patronizing\n    Given Margaret has age-related vision and dexterity changes\n    And she is a competent adult with decades of nursing experience\n    When Margaret uses the Value Scanner\n    Then the interface should have large, high-contrast fonts\n    And touch targets should be generous and forgiving\n    And voice interface options should be available\n    And navigation should be simple and consistent\n    And the pace should be patient without being condescending\n    And the tone should be respectful, never infantilizing\n    And Margaret should feel empowered and capable\n    And accessibility should enhance rather than diminish dignity\n\n  Scenario: Quantifying grandparent care contributions at individual level\n    Given Margaret provides 25 hours/week of active childcare\n    And market rate for professional childcare is ~$1,500/month\n    When the personal_agent tracks Margaret's care labor\n    Then it should quantify all hours spent in active childcare\n    And it should calculate economic value of her contributions\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for her labor\n    And it should recognize developmental benefits beyond market value\n    And Margaret should see that her work is substantial and valuable\n    And the data should counter narrative of \"just spending time with grandkids\"\n    And her contributions should be visible and quantified\n\n  Scenario: Building care economy capital for future aging needs\n    Given Margaret is watching her mother navigate advanced aging\n    And Margaret recognizes she will need care in 10-20 years\n    When Margaret makes care contributions now\n    Then care tokens should accumulate to her individual account\n    And these tokens should represent future care economy resources\n    And the system should help her build reciprocal relationships\n    And she should be preparing for her own increasing care needs\n    And current contributions should create future security\n    And Margaret should experience agency in planning her own aging\n    And care economy capital should provide retirement resilience\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining capacity boundaries for sustainable care provision\n    Given Margaret is 68 and has her own health considerations\n    And excessive care burden could compromise her well-being\n    When the personal_agent monitors Margaret's care load\n    Then it should track whether care labor exceeds healthy capacity\n    And it should alert if Margaret is sacrificing her own health\n    And it should suggest when to renegotiate care arrangements\n    And it should help her maintain sustainable care levels\n    And Margaret should be able to provide care without burning out\n    And the system should protect her well-being while valuing her contributions\n    And capacity monitoring should enable long-term care sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Privacy control over multigenerational care data\n    Given Margaret's data includes information about grandchildren and her mother\n    And health information is particularly sensitive\n    When Margaret determines data sharing preferences\n    Then she must have complete control over all her data\n    And she should choose what's shared with family members\n    And she can demonstrate care value to family if she wishes\n    And she can maintain complete privacy if she prefers\n    And health data sharing must be explicitly consented\n    And Margaret's autonomy over her information must be absolute\n    And privacy across generations must be carefully managed\n\n  Scenario: Recognition that grandparenting is care work, not leisure activity\n    Given traditional culture frames grandparenting as \"fun\" and \"spoiling\"\n    And Margaret's labor is often invisible as work\n    When the personal_agent characterizes Margaret's activities\n    Then it should frame grandparenting as sophisticated care labor\n    And it should recognize developmental care, emotional support, practical childcare\n    And it should distinguish between leisure time with grandkids and care work\n    And it should make visible that Margaret is providing essential services\n    And the narrative should shift from \"babysitting\" to care provision\n    And Margaret's work should be taken seriously as economic contribution\n    And her care labor should be recognized as valuable work\n\n  Scenario: Managing fixed retirement income while providing care\n    Given Margaret lives on retirement income that cannot be increased\n    And grandparenting sometimes involves expenses (activities, treats, supplies)\n    When Margaret's personal_agent tracks spending related to grandchildren\n    Then it should help her budget for grandparenting costs\n    And it should identify when care provision creates financial burden\n    And it should suggest discussions with family about cost-sharing\n    And it should help Margaret maintain dignity while managing constraints\n    And the system should prevent financial exploitation of grandparents\n    And Margaret should be able to provide care without financial hardship\n\n  Scenario: Tracking health considerations relevant to safe childcare\n    Given Margaret takes medications and has health conditions\n    And she needs to provide safe, active care for young children\n    When the personal_agent monitors Margaret's health status\n    Then it should track whether health enables safe childcare\n    And it should flag if medications or conditions affect caregiving capacity\n    And it should suggest when to communicate limitations to family\n    And it should support Margaret's health management\n    And it should ensure children's safety while preserving Margaret's dignity\n    And health monitoring should enable safe, sustainable care provision\n\n  Scenario: Personal growth and learning opportunities in retirement\n    Given Margaret is in early retirement with decades of life ahead\n    And she values continued learning and development\n    When the personal_agent tracks Margaret's activities\n    Then it should encourage and support continued education\n    And it should suggest learning opportunities aligned with her interests\n    And it should recognize that retirement is not the end of growth\n    And it should help her balance caregiving with personal development\n    And Margaret should experience retirement as liberation for new pursuits\n    And the system should affirm her capacity for continued growth and contribution\n\n  Scenario: Right to reduce or discontinue care provision with dignity\n    Given Margaret's care contributions are substantial but voluntary\n    And her capacity may change with health or life circumstances\n    When Margaret needs to reduce or stop grandparenting\n    Then the system should support this decision without stigma\n    And accumulated care tokens should remain hers regardless\n    And the family should have data showing her past contributions\n    And Margaret should be able to transition care with dignity\n    And she should not feel guilty for setting boundaries\n    And the protocol should enable graceful changes in care arrangements\n    And her autonomy over care provision must be absolute\n\n  Scenario: Recognition of emotional labor in grandparenting role\n    Given Margaret provides not just practical care but emotional support\n    And she navigates complex family dynamics with wisdom\n    When the personal_agent tracks Margaret's care contributions\n    Then it should recognize emotional labor as work\n    And it should value relationship maintenance and family harmony\n    And it should acknowledge the sophistication of intergenerational care\n    And it should quantify not just hours but quality of care\n    And emotional labor should be visible and valued\n    And Margaret's wisdom and relationship work should be recognized\n    And the full dimension of grandparenting care should be appreciated\n",
