  "content": "Scenario: Municipal community investment fund amplifies private capital\n    Given community investment pools have limited capital for large conversions\n    And municipal economic development funds could support democratic ownership\n    When city creates municipal community investment fund\n    Then Patricia's private investment is matched by public funds\n    And combined capital enables larger conversions (grocery stores, manufacturers)\n    And public-private partnership supports democratic economy at scale\n    And taxpayer money supports community wealth-building, not corporate extraction\n    And municipality_elohim manages public-private community investment coordination\n",
