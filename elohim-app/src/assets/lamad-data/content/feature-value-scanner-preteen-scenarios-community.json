Community Layer Value Recognition for Preteen\n  As a preteen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want my care contributions to connect me to community resources and support\n  So that my family receives reciprocal care through dignified community networks\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the preteen user \"Marcus\" is registered in the system\n    And Marcus's family participates in community care economy\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates care exchanges across the community\n    And community operates on reciprocity principles, not charity\n\n  Scenario: Care contributions qualify family for community resources\n    Given Marcus performs substantial household labor\n    And his care contributions are tracked and valued\n    When community resource allocation is determined\n    Then Marcus's demonstrated stewardship should qualify his family\n    And his care tokens should provide access to community support programs\n    And access should be based on care contributions, not means testing\n    And the framework should be reciprocity: he gives care, community gives care\n    And his household labor should be recognized as community contribution\n    And resource access should preserve dignity through reciprocity\n\n  Scenario: Community food security programs integrated with Value Scanner\n    Given Marcus manages food budget under severe constraints\n    And community food security programs exist\n    When Marcus's nutritional patterns indicate need\n    Then the community_elohim should connect him to food programs\n    And integration should be seamless, not requiring separate applications\n    And his care contributions should establish eligibility\n    And programs should be framed as community care exchanges\n    And access should not require stigmatizing means testing\n    And food security should be treated as community responsibility\n\n  Scenario: Educational scholarships recognize household stewardship\n    Given Marcus demonstrates sophisticated capability through scanner usage\n    And educational opportunities require funding\n    When scholarship opportunities arise\n    Then Marcus's care contributions should be evidence of his capability\n    And his resource management skills should be academically recognized\n    And community should invest in children demonstrating stewardship\n    And scholarships should flow to capable young people like Marcus\n    And his household labor should translate to educational opportunity\n    And care economy should create pathways to advancement\n\n  Scenario: After-school programs for Keisha accessed through care tokens\n    Given Marcus's sister Keisha needs care while Marcus shops\n    And after-school programs exist in the community\n    When care coordination needs are identified\n    Then Marcus's family should access programs through care token economy\n    And his care contributions should subsidize Keisha's program costs\n    And care economy should coordinate care needs across community\n    And Marcus's burden should be reduced through community support\n    And reciprocity should frame the exchange, not charity\n    And community care should support his family's flourishing\n\n  Scenario: Community recognizes preteen caregivers without exploitation\n    Given Marcus represents many young people with household responsibilities\n    And community should support rather than exploit young caregivers\n    When the community_elohim identifies preteen caregivers\n    Then it should channel appropriate support to these families\n    And it should prevent exploitation of children's labor\n    And it should work to reduce excessive burden on young people\n    And it should advocate for family support that makes Marcus's work unnecessary\n    And paradoxically, while recognizing his work, it should work toward making it optional\n    And care economy should support children while addressing systemic issues\n\n  Scenario: Community care networks provide emergency backup\n    Given Marcus's household operates on thin margins\n    And emergencies could overwhelm family capacity\n    When crisis situations arise\n    Then the community_elohim should activate emergency support\n    And community care networks should provide rapid assistance\n    And Marcus's family should receive help through established relationships\n    And emergency support should flow through care economy channels\n    And crisis intervention should prevent family breakdown\n    And community should function as safety net for vulnerable families\n\n  Scenario: Connection to community resources without stigma\n    Given Marcus's family needs support\n    And traditional social services often involve stigma\n    When Marcus accesses community resources\n    Then the protocol should preserve his dignity completely\n    And he should not feel like he's receiving charity\n    And the framing should always be reciprocal care exchange\n    And his contributions should be valued genuinely\n    And community support should strengthen rather than shame\n    And care economy should eliminate stigma from receiving help\n\n  Scenario: Community-level food justice advocacy informed by preteen experience\n    Given Marcus's experience reveals food system failures\n    And his data shows food access inequities\n    When community food policy is developed\n    Then Marcus's anonymized experience should inform advocacy\n    And the community_elohim should aggregate data about food insecurity\n    And community should advocate for systemic change\n    And Marcus's struggles should fuel collective political action\n    And care economy should connect individual experience to community organizing\n    And his burden should contribute to changing systems that create it\n\n  Scenario: Community mutual aid framework includes youth contributors\n    Given Marcus provides substantial care labor\n    And mutual aid operates on everyone having something to give\n    When community mutual aid networks operate\n    Then Marcus should be recognized as legitimate contributor\n    And his household labor should count as mutual aid contribution\n    And youth should be included in reciprocal care networks\n    And age should not exclude him from mutual aid participation\n    And community should value care work regardless of who performs it\n    And Marcus should experience being valued community member\n\n  Scenario: Transparent community resource allocation based on care contributions\n    Given community resources are limited\n    And allocation decisions must be made\n    When the community_elohim allocates resources\n    Then allocation should be based on transparent care economy principles\n    And care contributions should influence resource access\n    And Marcus's substantial household labor should be weighted appropriately\n    And the process should be visible and accountable\n    And community members should understand allocation rationale\n    And care economy should provide fair distribution framework\n\n  Scenario: Community coordination reduces individual family burden\n    Given Marcus carries heavy household responsibility\n    And community coordination could reduce this burden\n    When the community_elohim identifies systemic solutions\n    Then it should propose community-level responses to individual struggles\n    And collective action should be suggested: cooperatives, sharing networks, bulk buying\n    And Marcus's individual burden should decrease through community organization\n    And the protocol should demonstrate that care economy reduces isolation\n    And community should exist to coordinate care across families\n    And systemic support should replace individual heroics where possible\n\n  Scenario: Privacy protection in community care participation\n    Given Marcus participates in community care economy\n    And his family's specific circumstances are sensitive\n    When community resource coordination occurs\n    Then Marcus's privacy must be absolutely protected\n    And only anonymized data should be visible to community coordinators\n    And his specific situation should not be broadcast\n    And community support should flow without exposing private struggles\n    And dignity requires privacy even while participating in networks\n    And the protocol should enable solidarity without surveillance\n",
