  "content": "Scenario: Great-grandchildren learn care economy through elder relationship\n    Given Helen's great-grandchildren are young children\n    And they observe family caring for Helen\n    When great-grandchildren interact with Helen\n    Then they should learn that elders deserve care and respect\n    And they should see care flowing reciprocally across generations\n    And they should experience Helen as person, not problem\n    And they should learn that humans need more care as we age\n    And they should internalize that caregiving is valuable\n    And the protocol should teach care economy through family relationships\n    And next generation should grow up assuming care reciprocity is normal\n",
