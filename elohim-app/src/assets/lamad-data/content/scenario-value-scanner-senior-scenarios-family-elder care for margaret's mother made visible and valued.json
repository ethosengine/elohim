  "content": "Scenario: Elder care for Margaret's mother made visible and valued\n    Given Margaret provides 8 hours/week care coordination for her mother\n    And Margaret's nursing background makes her care highly skilled\n    When Margaret's elder care contributions are tracked\n    Then the sophisticated care labor should be recognized\n    And the time, skill, and emotional labor should be quantified\n    And Margaret's siblings should see her care contributions\n    And family resource allocation should reflect her caregiving\n    And elder care should be valued as the skilled work it is\n    And Margaret's contributions should give her voice in mother's care decisions\n",
