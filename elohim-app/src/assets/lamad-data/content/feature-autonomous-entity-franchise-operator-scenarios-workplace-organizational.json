Workplace Transformation from Franchise Control to Democratic Governance\n  As a franchise_operator in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer\n  I want to facilitate conversion from corporate franchise to democratic workplace\n  So that workers gain autonomy and business serves community not distant corporation\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And James's three ChickenMax franchises are converting to EAE network\n    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active\n    And franchise agreement termination is in process\n\n  Scenario: Franchise surveillance systems convert to worker-controlled witness infrastructure\n    Given corporate-mandated cameras monitored workers for compliance and speedup\n    And surveillance served corporate extraction, not worker protection\n    When conversion disconnects corporate surveillance feed\n    Then cameras network to local Elohim node under worker control\n    And footage protects workers from customer harassment and safety violations\n    And surveillance data cannot be used for discipline or productivity pressure\n    And workers democratically govern when and how footage is accessed\n    And workplace_elohim ensures corporate has no backdoor access to surveillance\n\n  Scenario: Corporate-mandated operational procedures are evaluated and selectively preserved\n    Given franchise required standardized procedures (some useful, others extractive)\n    And workers had no voice in which procedures served quality vs. extraction\n    When democratic governance reviews all franchise operational requirements\n    Then health and safety protocols are preserved and improved\n    And useful training structures are kept while eliminating degrading aspects\n    And extractive mechanisms (bathroom time limits, speedup metrics) are eliminated\n    And workers decide democratically which standards serve quality and dignity\n    And workplace_elohim documents procedural changes and rationale\n\n  Scenario: Mandatory franchise purchasing is replaced by democratic supplier relationships\n    Given franchise agreement required purchasing from corporate-approved vendors at markup\n    And local suppliers offering better quality and prices were prohibited\n    When purchasing autonomy is restored through franchise termination\n    Then workers establish direct relationships with Johnson Farm and local distributors\n    And supply costs decrease 30% through eliminating corporate markup\n    And quality improves through local sourcing and worker choice\n    And supplier relationships become partnerships, not corporate-mandated transactions\n    And workplace_elohim coordinates supply chain across EAE network\n\n  Scenario: Franchise menu constraints are lifted enabling local adaptation\n    Given corporate mandated standardized menu prohibiting innovation\n    And community requested options (vegan, healthier choices) were impossible to offer\n    When menu control transfers to democratic worker governance\n    Then workers add menu items responding to neighborhood preferences\n    And seasonal offerings use Johnson Farm's available produce\n    And cultural preferences of diverse community are reflected in menu\n    And innovation serves local needs rather than distant corporate standardization\n    And workplace_elohim tracks customer satisfaction with democratized menu\n\n  Scenario: Workers transition from implementing franchise extraction to democratic coordination\n    Given workers were required to enforce franchise policies regardless of harm\n    And implementation of extraction created moral injury and worker resentment\n    When democratic governance replaces franchise control\n    Then workers coordinate operations based on collective wisdom, not corporate mandates\n    And schedule flexibility serves workers' family needs, not corporate efficiency demands\n    And customer service becomes genuine care, not scripted performance\n    And workplace becomes site of flourishing, not extraction enforcement\n    And workplace_elohim supports workers' growing democratic governance capacity\n\n  Scenario: Franchise operator role (if staying) transforms from controller to facilitator\n    Given James controlled workers because franchise corporate controlled him\n    And hierarchical enforcement was required by franchise agreement\n    When James stays as transition steward facilitating democratic conversion\n    Then his role shifts from implementing corporate mandates to supporting worker autonomy\n    And operational expertise becomes consultation, not commands\n    And workers request his input because it's valuable, not because he's boss\n    And franchise termination liberates him to serve rather than control\n    And workplace_elohim ensures steward role doesn't recreate hierarchy\n\n  Scenario: Franchise brand transition occurs with community communication\n    Given locations were known as ChickenMax #247, #248, #249\n    And brand change could confuse or alienate customers\n    When democratic governance decides on rebranding strategy\n    Then some locations may de-brand (ChickenMax \u2192 Maria's Kitchen)\n    And others may maintain brand temporarily during transition\n    And customers are informed: same workers, democratic ownership, community commitment\n    And brand transition communicates values shift from corporate to community\n    And workplace_elohim manages customer communication during rebranding\n\n  Scenario: Franchise fee elimination creates immediate value distribution dividend\n    Given corporate extracted $30K franchise fee + $18K marketing fee per location annually\n    And mandatory purchasing added 30% markup ($50K+ annually per location)\n    When franchise termination eliminates all corporate extraction\n    Then $100K+ annually per location is freed for redistribution\n    And workers receive substantial wage increases (60% of freed value)\n    And community programs are funded (30% of freed value)\n    And sustainability investments are made (10% of freed value)\n    And workplace_elohim documents value circulation replacing extraction\n\n  Scenario: Multi-location franchise conversion creates worker coordination opportunities\n    Given James's three locations previously competed for corporate favor\n    And workers at different locations didn't coordinate or support each other\n    When all three locations convert to democratic EAE network simultaneously\n    Then workers across locations share learning and mutual support\n    And successful practices at one location spread to others\n    And workers can transfer between locations while maintaining ownership stakes\n    And collective bargaining power increases through multi-location coordination\n    And workplace_elohim facilitates inter-location worker collaboration\n\n  Scenario: Turnover decreases dramatically as workers gain ownership and dignity\n    Given franchise locations experienced 150% annual turnover due to low wages and poor conditions\n    And constant turnover harmed service quality and training efficiency\n    When conversion provides ownership, living wages, and democratic voice\n    Then worker retention improves to 90%+ (turnover drops to 10% annually)\n    And institutional knowledge accumulates instead of constantly draining\n    And training investments pay off through worker longevity\n    And customer relationships deepen through consistent staffing\n    And workplace_elohim documents retention improvements and cost savings\n\n  Scenario: Corporate quality standards are exceeded through worker ownership and pride\n    Given franchise corporate claimed standardization ensured quality\n    And workers had no stake in quality beyond avoiding discipline\n    When democratic ownership gives workers direct stake in quality outcomes\n    Then food quality improves because workers care about product they own\n    And customer service excellence emerges from genuine worker engagement\n    And cleanliness and maintenance improve through ownership pride\n    And quality exceeds previous franchise corporate standards\n    And workplace_elohim documents quality improvements post-conversion\n\n  Scenario: Franchise termination negotiation succeeds through EAE network support\n    Given franchise corporations resist terminations protecting extraction revenue\n    And individual operators have limited leverage against corporate legal resources\n    When EAE network coordinates multi-location conversion support\n    Then legal expertise is shared across conversions reducing costs\n    And coordinated multi-location terminations increase negotiating leverage\n    And public narrative (corporate bullying democratic workplaces) pressures franchise corporate\n    And termination succeeds protecting workers and enabling democratic ownership\n    And workplace_elohim coordinates franchise termination strategy across network\n",
