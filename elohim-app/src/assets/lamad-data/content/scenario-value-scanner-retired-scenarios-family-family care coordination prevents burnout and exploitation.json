  "content": "Scenario: Family care coordination prevents burnout and exploitation\n    Given Frank provides substantial family care across contexts\n    And care work can become exploitative even within families\n    When family_elohim monitors Frank's care burden\n    Then it should flag when contributions exceed sustainable levels\n    And surface if family is taking advantage without reciprocation\n    And recognize if Frank is sacrificing his wellbeing for family\n    And prompt discussions about fair distribution\n    And protect Frank from exploitation through visibility\n    And ensure family care operates on reciprocity, not extraction\n    And support Frank in maintaining boundaries\n",
