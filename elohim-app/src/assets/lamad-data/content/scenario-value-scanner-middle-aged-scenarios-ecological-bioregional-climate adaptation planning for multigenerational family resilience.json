  "content": "Scenario: Climate adaptation planning for multigenerational family resilience\n    Given climate change affects bioregional systems\n    And Robert's family will navigate climate impacts across generations\n    And adaptation planning protects family and bioregional resilience\n    When bioregional_elohim supports climate adaptation\n    Then it should help Robert plan for climate impacts on family\n    And surface bioregional climate risks: drought, flooding, extreme weather\n    And support household adaptation: water conservation, emergency preparedness, resilient food systems\n    And connect adaptation to care economy principles\n    And recognize that climate adaptation is care for family and bioregion\n    And build resilience that serves current and future generations\n    And demonstrate that ecological care is practical family responsibility\n",
