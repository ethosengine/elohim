Educational Layer Value Literacy for Child\n  As a child in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want to develop genuine value literacy through guided practice\n  So that I build care-based economic thinking for life\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the child user \"Emma\" is registered in the system\n    And Emma is 8 years old in the Guided Autonomy phase\n    And the educational governance context is active\n    And pedagogical principles for ages 8-10 are configured\n    And Emma's personal_agent uses Socratic teaching method\n    And Emma is at concrete operations cognitive stage\n\n  Scenario: Learning through Socratic questioning not direct instruction\n    Given Emma is comparing two products\n    And her personal_agent serves as teacher-guide\n    When Emma seeks guidance on which to choose\n    Then the agent should ask \"What do you notice about these two options?\"\n    And the agent should follow up based on Emma's observations\n    And the agent should ask \"Which one do you think would work better for your family?\"\n    And direct instruction should be avoided\n    And Emma should develop her own reasoning through inquiry\n    And critical thinking should be built through question-based pedagogy\n    And teaching should treat Emma as thinker, not rule-follower\n\n  Scenario: Concrete operations stage supports numerical comparison\n    Given Emma can handle basic math at age 8\n    And she is developing numerical reasoning\n    When Emma compares prices or quantities\n    Then the personal_agent should support mathematical thinking\n    And the agent should ask \"How much money would we save?\"\n    And simple calculations should be scaffolded\n    And Emma should practice applying math to real decisions\n    And numerical literacy should be built through authentic use\n    And abstract concepts should be grounded in concrete comparisons\n\n  Scenario: Moral development supported through care-based choices\n    Given Emma is at conventional morality stage (ages 7-11)\n    And she is developing sense of right and wrong\n    When Emma makes choices that affect others\n    Then the personal_agent should highlight moral dimensions\n    And the agent should ask \"How will this choice affect Tommy?\"\n    And care ethics should be made explicit in decisions\n    And Emma should develop moral reasoning through practice\n    And value decisions should be framed as care decisions\n    And moral development should be integrated with economic learning\n\n  Scenario: Category formation applied to understanding value dimensions\n    Given Emma is developing ability to categorize and classify\n    And she can understand multiple attributes simultaneously\n    When Emma evaluates products\n    Then the personal_agent should help her categorize value types\n    And the agent should present: nutritional value, environmental impact, care labor, price\n    And Emma should learn to organize complexity through categories\n    And cognitive development should support multi-dimensional analysis\n    And value literacy should build on natural categorization abilities\n\n  Scenario: Foundation for lifetime care economy thinking established\n    Given Emma is forming foundational economic beliefs ages 8-10\n    And early patterns shape lifelong thinking\n    When Emma consistently makes care-based value decisions\n    Then she should internalize resources are for stewardship\n    And she should learn choices affect others' flourishing\n    And she should understand care creates value\n    And neural pathways for care economy should form\n    And she should have alternative to consumer capitalism as baseline\n    And this generation should grow up assuming care economy is normal\n\n  Scenario: Learning value literacy, not just price comparison\n    Given Emma is building complex understanding of value\n    And value extends far beyond simple price\n    When Emma uses the Value Scanner for education\n    Then she should learn to see multiple value dimensions\n    And nutritional value should be explored\n    And environmental impact should be age-appropriately introduced\n    And care labor embedded in production should be made visible\n    And community benefit should be considered\n    And she should learn to read complexity, not just price tags\n\n  Scenario: Pedagogical approach adapts to individual learning pace\n    Given Emma's development may vary from age averages\n    And learning readiness differs across children\n    When the personal_agent teaches value concepts\n    Then instruction should adapt to Emma's actual capabilities\n    And pacing should match her individual readiness\n    And the system should observe comprehension signals\n    And no child should be pushed beyond capacity\n    And no child should be held back from what they're ready to learn\n    And personalized learning should respect individual development\n\n  Scenario: Safe environment for learning from mistakes\n    Given Emma is practicing value literacy\n    And mistakes are essential to learning\n    When Emma makes a choice that doesn't work out well\n    Then the experience should be treated as learning opportunity\n    And her personal_agent should guide reflection: \"How did that work out?\"\n    And no shame or punishment should be attached to mistakes\n    And consequences should be educational, not harmful\n    And judgment should be built through safe practice\n    And error should be normalized as part of learning process\n\n  Scenario: Building judgment before adolescence raises stakes\n    Given Emma is practicing value decisions ages 8-10\n    And adolescence will bring higher-stakes choices\n    When Emma develops decision-making skills through scanner\n    Then she should build capacity while consequences are manageable\n    And judgment should be practiced in low-risk context\n    And she should develop value literacy before teen years\n    And safe practice should prepare her for Real Responsibility phase (11-13)\n    And developmental progression should scaffold increasing autonomy\n    And early practice should enable later capability\n\n  Scenario: School curriculum integration supports value literacy\n    Given Emma's school may integrate Value Scanner data\n    And educational layer includes formal learning contexts\n    When Emma's anonymized scanner data is shared with school (with family permission)\n    Then data should support curriculum in nutrition, math, social studies\n    And learning should be reinforced across contexts\n    And family permission should be required for school integration\n    And Emma's privacy should be protected in educational use\n    And formal education should complement experiential learning\n    And value literacy should be built across multiple contexts\n\n  Scenario: Teaching that care work creates economic value\n    Given traditional economics makes care work invisible\n    And Emma is forming foundational economic understanding\n    When Emma performs care labor through scanner decisions\n    Then the system should explicitly teach care creates value\n    And her personal_agent should say \"Your stewardship helped your family\"\n    And care contributions should be valued concretely\n    And she should learn caring for others is economically valuable\n    And care economy framework should be established as baseline\n    And she should understand care before being exposed to extraction economics\n\n  Scenario: Educational design prevents consumer identity formation\n    Given consumer capitalism targets children for conditioning\n    And Emma is in critical identity formation years\n    When Emma learns through the Value Scanner\n    Then no gamification should train extraction thinking\n    And no points systems should create consumption addiction\n    And no rewards should condition acquisition behavior\n    And identity should center on stewardship, not consumption\n    And she should learn to see herself as contributor, not consumer\n    And care-based identity should be cultivated intentionally\n\n  Scenario: Accessibility features support diverse learning needs\n    Given Emma may have varied learning needs\n    And accessibility is required for equitable education\n    When Emma uses educational features of the scanner\n    Then multiple modalities should be available (visual, audio, text)\n    And reading support should be provided as needed\n    And math scaffolding should be accessible\n    And voice guidance should be option\n    And interface should serve children with diverse abilities\n    And educational access should be universal\n\n  Scenario: Learning contributes to collective knowledge without exploitation\n    Given Emma's learning patterns generate educational data\n    And this data could improve pedagogy for other children\n    When Emma's anonymized learning data is collected\n    Then it must only be used to improve educational outcomes\n    And Emma's privacy must be absolutely protected\n    And no commercial exploitation should occur\n    And data should serve collective learning, not surveillance capitalism\n    And educational data must never be monetized\n    And community benefit must not compromise individual privacy\n\n  Scenario: Environmental care literacy appropriate to concrete operations\n    Given care economy extends to ecological relationships\n    And Emma can understand concrete environmental concepts\n    When Emma learns about environmental impact through scanner\n    Then ecological care should be presented at age-appropriate level\n    And the agent should say \"This packaging can be recycled\" (concrete)\n    And abstract sustainability concepts should be avoided\n    And connections between caring for people and planet should begin\n    And Emma should develop environmental consciousness\n    And ecological stewardship foundations should be laid for future development\n",
