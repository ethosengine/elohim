  "content": "Scenario: Explaining attack vectors and security risks\n    Given appellant claims agent could be manipulated\n    And council needs to understand vulnerability\n    When I explain potential attack vectors\n    Then I describe: how agents could be corrupted or gamed\n    And I assess: likelihood and impact of different attacks\n    And I explain: defense mechanisms in place\n    And I acknowledge: residual risks that remain\n    And I avoid: either dismissing concerns or creating panic\n    And I provide: realistic risk assessment\n    And council can: judge if security is adequate for constitutional governance\n",
