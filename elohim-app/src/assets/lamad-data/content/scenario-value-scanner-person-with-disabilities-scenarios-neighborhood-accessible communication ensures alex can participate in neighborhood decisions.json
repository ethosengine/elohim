  "content": "Scenario: Accessible communication ensures Alex can participate in neighborhood decisions\n    Given neighborhood uses various communication methods\n    And some methods may exclude Alex\n    When neighborhood decisions are made\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should ensure accessible communication\n    And neighborhood should use multiple formats (digital, physical, verbal)\n    And Alex should have equal access to all neighborhood information\n    And voting and input processes should be accessible\n    And Alex's voice should be included in neighborhood governance\n    And accessibility should be default, not accommodation\n    And the protocol should ensure Alex's full participation\n",
