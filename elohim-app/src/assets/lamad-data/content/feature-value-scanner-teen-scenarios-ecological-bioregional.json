Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Teen\n  As a teen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want to understand how my consumption choices affect ecological systems\n  So that I participate in bioregional care economy and extend stewardship to land, water, and future generations\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teen user \"Jasmine\" is registered in the system\n    And Jasmine is 16 years old\n    And she lives in the Riverside bioregion\n    And the ecological governance context is active\n    And bioregional_elohim tracks environmental and ecosystem impacts\n    And Jasmine's personal_agent integrates ecological awareness\n\n  Scenario: Teen develops sophisticated understanding of consumption impacts\n    Given Jasmine makes daily purchasing decisions\n    And each choice has ecological consequences\n    When she uses the Value Scanner to evaluate options\n    Then her personal_agent should surface ecological information\n    And explain water usage, carbon footprint, and ecosystem impacts\n    And connect choices to bioregional effects: \"This produce is local and seasonal\"\n    And help her understand that consumption is participation in ecological systems\n    And build sophisticated ecological literacy through daily practice\n    And develop her capability to make environmentally informed decisions\n\n  Scenario: Local and seasonal food choices recognized as bioregional care\n    Given Jasmine is shopping for fresh produce\n    And she has option between local strawberries and imported berries\n    When bioregional_elohim provides decision support\n    Then it should highlight local, seasonal options\n    And explain bioregional benefits: \"Local strawberries support regional farmers and reduce transport emissions\"\n    And help her understand food system connections to ecosystem health\n    And recognize her choice of local food as care for bioregion\n    And track bioregional care contributions alongside other care work\n    And demonstrate that environmental stewardship is care economy participation\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns bioregional water and energy systems\n    Given Jasmine lives in a watershed with specific water dynamics\n    And her consumption affects water and energy resources\n    When her personal_agent explains resource connections\n    Then it should teach her about local water sources and constraints\n    And show how her choices affect regional water availability\n    And explain energy systems powering her community\n    And connect individual consumption to collective resource management\n    And build understanding of herself as participant in bioregional systems\n    And develop ecological citizenship grounded in local ecosystems\n\n  Scenario: Sustainable consumption choices tracked as environmental care work\n    Given Jasmine preferentially chooses sustainable products\n    And she has bought local/seasonal/sustainable products in 12 of 15 purchases\n    When bioregional_elohim analyzes her consumption patterns\n    Then it should recognize her environmental care contributions\n    And track her choices as care work for ecosystem health\n    And calculate environmental impact reduction from her choices\n    And value bioregional stewardship in care token allocation\n    And demonstrate that ecological care creates economic value\n    And recognize environmental activism as legitimate care labor\n\n  Scenario: Teen climate activism recognized as care for future generations\n    Given Jasmine participates in climate action organizing\n    And she attends climate strikes and advocates for environmental policy\n    When bioregional_elohim tracks her environmental engagement\n    Then it should recognize climate activism as care work\n    And value her labor for intergenerational justice\n    And understand that fighting for climate action is care for future\n    And track civic environmental engagement alongside other care contributions\n    And demonstrate that ecological advocacy is essential care economy work\n    And support her generation's environmental leadership\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional food systems supported by teen participation\n    Given Jasmine's bioregion has local farms and food producers\n    And supporting local agriculture strengthens bioregional resilience\n    When she chooses local food through the Value Scanner\n    Then bioregional_elohim should track support for local food systems\n    And recognize that her purchases sustain regional agriculture\n    And show how local food choices support bioregional economy\n    And connect her consumption to farmer livelihoods and land stewardship\n    And help her understand food system as part of bioregional care economy\n    And demonstrate that her choices affect ecosystem and economy together\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns to value ecosystem services\n    Given Jasmine benefits from clean water, air, and functional ecosystems\n    And ecosystem services are typically invisible in market economy\n    When bioregional_elohim explains ecosystem dependencies\n    Then it should teach her about ecosystem services she depends on\n    And show how wetlands filter water, forests stabilize climate, and pollinators enable food production\n    And help her understand that ecosystems provide care that sustains human life\n    And recognize that ecosystem health is prerequisite for all other care\n    And value ecological stewardship as foundational care work\n    And build understanding that economy depends on ecology, not the other way around\n\n  Scenario: Waste reduction and circular economy practices tracked\n    Given Jasmine practices waste reduction and composting\n    And she chooses products with minimal packaging\n    When bioregional_elohim tracks her waste and resource patterns\n    Then it should recognize waste reduction as bioregional care work\n    And calculate diversion from landfill and resource conservation\n    And value her participation in circular economy practices\n    And connect individual waste choices to bioregional resource flows\n    And demonstrate that waste reduction is care for ecosystem health\n    And support transition from linear to circular economic thinking\n\n  Scenario: Teen participates in bioregional ecological restoration\n    Given Jasmine volunteers for watershed cleanup events\n    And she plants native species in community restoration projects\n    When bioregional_elohim tracks her ecological care labor\n    Then it should recognize restoration work as care for land and ecosystem\n    And value her labor for ecosystem health at care economy rates\n    And calculate ecological benefits from restoration participation\n    And acknowledge that she's doing work professional ecologists would be paid for\n    And demonstrate that ecological labor deserves recognition and compensation\n    And support her understanding that ecosystem repair is collective responsibility\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional knowledge transmitted across generations\n    Given Jasmine learns from elders about local ecology and seasonal patterns\n    And indigenous and long-term residents hold bioregional knowledge\n    When she engages with bioregional wisdom holders\n    Then bioregional_elohim should recognize knowledge transmission\n    And value elder teaching as care work for ecological literacy\n    And support intergenerational ecological knowledge sharing\n    And help her understand that bioregional care includes cultural practices\n    And connect her to deep knowledge about living in her specific place\n    And demonstrate that care economy includes indigenous wisdom and ecological tradition\n\n  Scenario: Teen's generation prepares for climate adaptation\n    Given Jasmine's generation will face climate change impacts\n    And bioregional resilience requires preparation and adaptation\n    When bioregional_elohim engages climate preparation\n    Then it should help her understand local climate vulnerabilities\n    And support her developing adaptive capabilities\n    And recognize her climate preparation as care for future self and community\n    And connect her to bioregional climate adaptation networks\n    And value her generation's work to build climate resilience\n    And support realistic engagement with ecological challenges her generation inherits\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional care economy integrates human and ecosystem flourishing\n    Given Jasmine participates in care economy across multiple contexts\n    And all human care depends on functioning ecosystems\n    When her personal_agent provides comprehensive care economy view\n    Then it should integrate ecological care with social and economic care\n    And show that caring for ecosystems enables caring for people\n    And demonstrate that bioregional health is inseparable from community health\n    And help her understand care economy as integrated human-ecological system\n    And build expectation that economy must serve both human and ecosystem flourishing\n    And internalize that her generation must heal relationship between economy and ecology\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns that ecological care is intergenerational justice\n    Given current consumption patterns affect future generations\n    And Jasmine's choices impact the world her future children will inherit\n    When bioregional_elohim frames ecological decisions\n    Then it should connect her choices to intergenerational impact\n    And help her understand ecological care as care for future people\n    And recognize that environmental stewardship is care work across time\n    And build her sense of responsibility to future generations\n    And demonstrate that care economy extends forward in time\n    And support her generation's commitment to leaving a livable world\n",
