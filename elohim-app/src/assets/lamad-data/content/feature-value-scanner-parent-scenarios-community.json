Community Layer Value Recognition for Parent\n  As a parent participating in civic life while raising children\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want my parenting recognized as community contribution\n  So that raising citizens is valued as essential civic work\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the parent user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah participates in her community through schools, organizations, and civic life\n    And Sarah is raising future citizens Tommy and Emma\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates community care economy\n    And Sarah's parenting is community work, not just private family matter\n\n  Scenario: Parenting recognized as community care contribution\n    Given Sarah is raising children who will become community members\n    And she is preparing them for civic participation and social responsibility\n    When the community_elohim tracks Sarah's contributions\n    Then it should recognize parenting as community-building work\n    And raising future citizens should be valued as civic labor\n    And Sarah's parenting should accumulate community care tokens\n    And her work should be recognized as essential to community continuity\n    And parenting should be understood as public good, not private consumption\n    And the community should value child-rearing as collective investment\n\n  Scenario: Parent participation in school governance and advocacy\n    Given Sarah participates in school board meetings and parent committees\n    And she advocates for better educational policies\n    When the community_elohim tracks Sarah's civic engagement\n    Then it should recognize school participation as care labor\n    And advocacy for children's education should accumulate care tokens\n    And parent organizing should be valued as political work\n    And Sarah's effort to improve schools should be community contribution\n    And the system should recognize that parents are primary education stakeholders\n    And civic labor should be visible and valued\n\n  Scenario: Community care tokens enable resource access for families\n    Given Sarah has accumulated care tokens through parenting and civic participation\n    And community resources are allocated partially based on care economy\n    When Sarah's family needs community support\n    Then her care tokens should give standing in resource decisions\n    And the community should provide support based on her contributions\n    And care economy should enable reciprocity between family and community\n    And those who contribute care should receive care in return\n    And the system should create sustainable community mutual aid\n    And parenting contributions should translate to community support\n\n  Scenario: Parent networks coordinate community-wide childcare infrastructure\n    Given multiple families need reliable, affordable childcare\n    And current market solutions are inadequate\n    When the community_elohim coordinates childcare infrastructure\n    Then it should enable parent-led cooperative childcare\n    And it should help organize community-owned childcare centers\n    And parent labor should be valued in cooperative structures\n    And care tokens should enable access regardless of income\n    And the community should build childcare as commons, not commodity\n    And the system should enable collective solutions to care needs\n\n  Scenario: Community recognition of parent expertise in child development\n    Given Sarah has professional-grade expertise in child development\n    And she is an experienced teacher and parent\n    When the community seeks expertise on children's issues\n    Then Sarah's knowledge should be valued and consulted\n    And parent expertise should be recognized alongside professional credentials\n    And she should be invited to community policy discussions\n    And her care tokens should reflect her knowledge contributions\n    And the community should tap parent expertise for decision-making\n    And parenting experience should be valued as legitimate expertise\n\n  Scenario: Community support for parent mental health and well-being\n    Given parenting is intense work with high burnout risk\n    And Sarah needs community support to sustain care work\n    When the community_elohim assesses parent well-being\n    Then it should connect Sarah to mental health resources\n    And it should provide respite care and support services\n    And the community should invest in parent sustainability\n    And parent well-being should be recognized as community priority\n    And the system should prevent parent burnout through community care\n    And supporting parents should be understood as supporting children\n\n  Scenario: Parent organizing for family-friendly community policies\n    Given community policies affect families' quality of life\n    And Sarah wants better parks, libraries, family resources\n    When parents organize for policy change\n    Then the community_elohim should facilitate collective advocacy\n    And it should coordinate parent political power\n    And organizing labor should accumulate care tokens\n    And Sarah's advocacy should be recognized as community contribution\n    And parent collective action should be amplified by care economy\n    And the system should translate care work into political power\n\n  Scenario: Community cultural events and intergenerational connection\n    Given communities thrive on cultural connection and celebration\n    And Sarah wants children integrated into community life\n    When the community_elohim coordinates cultural events\n    Then it should facilitate family participation in community culture\n    And it should recognize Sarah's work bringing children to events\n    And cultural transmission should be valued as care labor\n    And intergenerational community events should be prioritized\n    And the system should build community bonds across generations\n    And family participation should strengthen community cohesion\n\n  Scenario: Community emergency preparedness includes family needs\n    Given emergencies affect families with unique challenges\n    And children have specific needs during crisis\n    When the community_elohim coordinates emergency preparedness\n    Then it should ensure family needs are centered in planning\n    And Sarah's knowledge of family needs should inform planning\n    And emergency care resources should include childcare and family support\n    And parent expertise should shape community resilience\n    And the system should recognize that community safety includes child safety\n    And family preparedness should be community priority\n\n  Scenario: Community economic support recognizes parenting as work\n    Given Sarah performs enormous care labor essential to community\n    And traditional economy renders this work unpaid\n    When the community implements care economy principles\n    Then parenting should be recognized as valuable economic contribution\n    And care tokens could translate to community currency or benefits\n    And Sarah should have economic support for her care work\n    And the community should invest in parents as essential workers\n    And care economy should provide material support, not just recognition\n    And the system should enable economic justice for caregivers\n\n  Scenario: Community learning spaces for parent education and support\n    Given parents need ongoing education and skill development\n    And Sarah both teaches and learns from other parents\n    When the community_elohim coordinates parent education\n    Then it should provide spaces for parent learning and skill-sharing\n    And it should recognize teaching labor and learning participation\n    And parent education should be accessible and valued\n    And the community should invest in parent capability-building\n    And the system should create communities of practice for parents\n    And parenting skills should be continuously developed\n\n  Scenario: Community accountability for supporting families\n    Given communities depend on families raising next generation\n    And Sarah's parenting work benefits entire community\n    When the community_elohim tracks community support for families\n    Then it should measure whether community is adequately supporting parents\n    And it should identify gaps in family resources and support\n    And it should create accountability for community investment in children\n    And the system should ensure communities reciprocate for parent contributions\n    And care economy should make community obligations to families visible\n    And the community should be accountable for enabling parent success\n",
