  "content": "Scenario: Teen accesses community resources based on care contributions\n    Given Jasmine has accumulated significant care tokens\n    And the community offers educational programs and skill-building workshops\n    When Jasmine seeks to access community opportunities\n    Then her care contributions should qualify her for access\n    And she should not need parent mediation to access community resources\n    And the community_elohim should recognize her as an independent participant\n    And opportunities should be surfaced based on her interests and contribution patterns\n    And she should experience that care economy operates on reciprocity\n    And her care tokens should give her legitimate standing to access community resources\n",
