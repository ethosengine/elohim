Educational Layer Value Literacy for Preteen\n  As a preteen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want my real-world care responsibilities to be recognized as sophisticated learning\n  So that my applied capabilities are valued academically and I develop advanced stewardship skills\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the preteen user \"Marcus\" is registered in the system\n    And Marcus is 12 years old in the Real Responsibility phase\n    And the educational governance context is active\n    And Marcus applies sophisticated skills through household management\n    And educational institutions can integrate real-world learning\n\n  Scenario: Real-world household management recognized as applied learning\n    Given Marcus manages complex household operations\n    And he applies math, nutrition science, planning, and resource management\n    When Marcus's scanner usage is analyzed educationally\n    Then his applied skills should be recognized as sophisticated learning\n    And the educational system should value real-world capability\n    And his household work should qualify for academic recognition\n    And applied learning should be weighted alongside traditional academics\n    And his competencies should be documented and credentialed\n    And practical stewardship should have educational value\n\n  Scenario: Developing abstract thinking through real economic complexity\n    Given Marcus is in developmental phase of emerging abstract thought\n    And he manages genuinely complex resource coordination\n    When Marcus plans meals and budgets across time\n    Then he should be developing advanced cognitive capabilities\n    And abstract concepts like opportunity cost should be learned through application\n    And systems thinking should develop through real experience\n    And the personal_agent should support abstract reasoning development\n    And complex adult work should accelerate cognitive maturation\n    And educational scaffolding should support his emerging abstraction\n\n  Scenario: Nutritional science learned through responsibility for health\n    Given Marcus is responsible for his and Keisha's nutrition\n    And adequate nutrition requires scientific understanding\n    When Marcus makes food choices\n    Then he should be learning applied nutritional science\n    And the personal_agent should teach nutrition in context\n    And he should understand macronutrients, vitamins, balanced diet\n    And learning should be motivated by real care responsibility\n    And nutritional education should be deeper than typical age 12 curriculum\n    And his care work should accelerate domain-specific learning\n\n  Scenario: Mathematical skills developed through budget management\n    Given Marcus manages $75 weekly budget across multiple constraints\n    And budgeting requires sophisticated mathematical thinking\n    When Marcus allocates resources across needs\n    Then he should be learning applied mathematics\n    And he should practice percentage calculations, unit pricing, budgeting\n    And math should be learned through authentic application\n    And his mathematical capabilities should exceed typical age-level expectations\n    And the personal_agent should reinforce mathematical concepts\n    And care economy should provide rich mathematical learning environment\n\n  Scenario: Planning and executive function skills from complex coordination\n    Given Marcus coordinates meals across week\n    And he manages inventory, shopping lists, multi-store trips\n    When Marcus exercises planning capabilities\n    Then his executive function should be developing rapidly\n    And he should be learning advanced planning and organization\n    And time management and future orientation should develop\n    And working memory and cognitive flexibility should be exercised\n    And the personal_agent should support executive function development\n    And real responsibility should build sophisticated planning capacity\n\n  Scenario: Alternative educational pathways honor real-world capability\n    Given Marcus has demonstrated sophisticated stewardship\n    And traditional school may not capture his capabilities\n    When educational pathways are considered\n    Then alternative credentials should recognize his applied skills\n    And competency-based advancement should be available\n    And his household management should qualify for advanced placement\n    And educational system should honor multiple forms of intelligence\n    And practical capability should open doors to opportunity\n    And care economy should create pathways beyond traditional academics\n\n  Scenario: Learning economic systems through lived experience\n    Given Marcus navigates real economic constraints daily\n    And he experiences market systems, pricing, scarcity directly\n    When Marcus develops economic understanding\n    Then he should learn economics through authentic participation\n    And he should understand supply and demand through shopping\n    And he should grasp market failures through food desert experience\n    And economic theory should be grounded in lived reality\n    And his understanding should be deeper than abstract classroom learning\n    And care economy should provide superior economic education\n\n  Scenario: Moral and ethical development through care responsibility\n    Given Marcus makes decisions affecting others' wellbeing\n    And he balances competing needs with limited resources\n    When Marcus exercises moral reasoning\n    Then he should be developing sophisticated ethical thinking\n    And he should understand fairness, reciprocity, and justice\n    And moral development should accelerate through real responsibility\n    And care ethics should be learned through practice\n    And his moral maturation should advance beyond typical age expectations\n    And care economy should support healthy moral development\n\n  Scenario: Integration with school curriculum where beneficial\n    Given Marcus's real-world learning is substantial\n    And school integration could recognize his capabilities\n    When Marcus grants permission for school integration\n    Then the Value Scanner could share relevant learning data\n    And schools could award credit for applied learning\n    And his care contributions could supplement traditional coursework\n    And integration should benefit Marcus academically\n    And his consent and privacy should be absolute requirements\n    And school recognition should honor his real-world competence\n\n  Scenario: Educational support targeted to preteen's actual learning needs\n    Given Marcus has gaps in some areas and advanced skills in others\n    And his education should serve his whole development\n    When educational resources are allocated\n    Then support should target his actual needs, not age assumptions\n    And he should receive advanced instruction in areas of strength\n    And he should get support in areas where household burden limits learning\n    And education should be personalized to his unique situation\n    And the system should ensure his care burden doesn't limit his education\n    And he should have full educational opportunity despite responsibilities\n\n  Scenario: Scholarship eligibility based on demonstrated stewardship\n    Given Marcus demonstrates exceptional capability and commitment\n    And scholarships should go to deserving students\n    When scholarship decisions are made\n    Then Marcus's household stewardship should be powerful evidence\n    And his care contributions should qualify as exceptional achievement\n    And community should invest in young people proving their capability\n    And care economy framework should influence scholarship criteria\n    And his real-world responsibility should be valued over traditional metrics\n    And educational opportunity should flow to those demonstrating care\n\n  Scenario: Learning resource management as life skill\n    Given Marcus manages complex household resources\n    And resource stewardship is critical life skill\n    When Marcus practices resource management\n    Then he should be learning sophisticated stewardship\n    And he should understand budgeting, planning, optimization\n    And he should develop skills most people don't learn until adulthood\n    And his education should include practical life competencies\n    And resource management should be recognized as valuable learning\n    And care economy should teach skills for thriving under constraint\n",
