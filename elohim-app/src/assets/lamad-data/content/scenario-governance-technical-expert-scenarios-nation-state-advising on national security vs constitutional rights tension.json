  "content": "Scenario: Advising on national security vs constitutional rights tension\n    Given appeal involves claimed national security justification\n    And technical assessment is needed of security claims\n    When I evaluate security-rights tradeoff technically\n    Then I assess: whether claimed vulnerability is technically legitimate\n    And I explore: whether less rights-violating technical alternatives exist\n    And I examine: whether proposed security measure would actually work\n    And I clarify: technical reality vs security theater\n    And I avoid: dismissing security needs or exaggerating threats\n    And I provide: honest technical assessment\n    And I let: council judge values tradeoff given technical facts\n",
