  "content": "Scenario: Anonymous franchise locations become known community institutions\n    Given ChickenMax #247, #248, #249 were corporate outposts without local identity\n    And community members saw them as extractive chains, not neighborhood businesses\n    When conversion makes locations democratically-governed community institutions\n    Then neighborhoods learn their franchise locations chose democratic ownership\n    And locations develop distinct community identities (possibly rebranding with local names)\n    And community members recognize workers as co-owners, not exploited employees\n    And institutions become sources of neighborhood pride instead of corporate extraction symbols\n    And community_elohim communicates conversion story building community ownership\n",
