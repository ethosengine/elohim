District Governance for Board Member\n  As a board member serving on a district board in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the district governance layer\n  I want independent analysis and accessible expertise for district-wide decisions\n  So that I can exercise informed judgment on consequential policies affecting thousands of constituents\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the board_member user is registered in the system\n    And the district governance context is active\n    And I am a volunteer serving on a school board or special district board\n\n  Scenario: Board member receives independent analysis of staff budget recommendation\n    Given district superintendent recommends budget with significant program cuts\n    And 200-page budget packet emphasizes efficiency and fiscal responsibility\n    And board meeting is in 3 days with vote expected\n    When the board member requests Observer independent analysis\n    Then they receive concise summary identifying key trade-offs staff minimized\n    And see comparison of per-student spending across district schools showing disparities\n    And access data on community impacts of proposed cuts by demographic group\n    And get examples of how similar districts managed budget challenges differently\n    And independent analysis reveals information asymmetry in staff presentation\n\n  Scenario: Board member learns accessible expertise on complex water infrastructure decision\n    Given water district faces decision on $50M infrastructure upgrade\n    And engineering staff presentation uses technical jargon and assumptions\n    And board member has no engineering background but must vote responsibly\n    When the board member uses Observer to understand the decision\n    Then they receive plain-language explanation of technical trade-offs\n    And see comparison of infrastructure approaches used by similar districts\n    And access key questions to ask staff about cost estimates and alternatives\n    And get context on long-term maintenance and rate impacts\n    And accessible expertise enables informed decision without full-time study\n\n  Scenario: Board member tracks implementation of previous transportation policy\n    Given board voted two years ago to optimize bus routes for efficiency\n    And transportation director promised improved reliability and cost savings\n    And parents increasingly complain about late buses and long routes\n    When the board member checks Observer implementation tracking\n    Then they see on-time performance has actually declined since policy change\n    And discover cost savings didn't materialize as promised\n    And find low-income neighborhoods disproportionately affected by route changes\n    And access parent feedback data showing systematic reliability problems\n    And impact tracking reveals staff promises diverged from actual outcomes\n\n  Scenario: Board member detects potential conflict of interest in vendor contract\n    Given district staff recommends contract with technology vendor\n    And recommendation emphasizes vendor qualifications and competitive pricing\n    And board will vote on $2M multi-year contract next meeting\n    When the board member uses Observer to review the recommendation\n    Then they discover vendor donated to superintendent's previous campaigns\n    And see vendor's track record in other districts shows implementation problems\n    And find contract terms more favorable to vendor than peer district contracts\n    And access data showing alternative vendors with better performance\n    And capture protection makes conflict of interest and manipulation visible\n\n  Scenario: Board member understands community priorities beyond meeting testimony\n    Given board considers policy change to school calendar\n    And testimony at meeting is dominated by teachers union advocating position\n    And only 15 community members attended to testify\n    When the board member seeks community accountability data from Observer\n    Then they see survey data from thousands of district families on calendar preferences\n    And discover working families have different priorities than those who testified\n    And access childcare impact analysis showing consequences for different populations\n    And understand community needs beyond who has time to attend meetings\n    And community accountability helps board serve diverse constituent interests\n\n  Scenario: Board member compares district performance to jurisdictional peers\n    Given board reviews annual student achievement and equity data\n    And superintendent presents results emphasizing positive trends\n    And board wants to understand if district is truly serving all students well\n    When the board member uses Observer cross-district comparison\n    Then they see district's achievement gaps larger than similar districts\n    And discover other districts closed equity gaps while this one widened\n    And access specific practices peer districts used to improve outcomes\n    And identify areas where staff presentation masked concerning patterns\n    And independent analysis helps board exercise meaningful oversight\n\n  Scenario: Board member prepares for contentious development decision in special district\n    Given transit district board must decide on major service expansion\n    And developers advocate for routes serving new developments\n    And existing riders advocate for frequency improvements on current routes\n    And staff recommendation favors expansion over frequency\n    When the board member uses Observer decision support\n    Then they receive ridership data showing current overcrowding and reliability issues\n    And see community benefits analysis comparing expansion versus improvement\n    And access transportation equity analysis of who is served by each option\n    And get examples of how peer transit districts approached similar trade-offs\n    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment balancing competing interests\n",
