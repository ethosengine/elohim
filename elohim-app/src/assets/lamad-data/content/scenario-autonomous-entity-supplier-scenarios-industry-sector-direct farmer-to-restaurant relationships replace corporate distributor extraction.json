  "content": "Scenario: Direct farmer-to-restaurant relationships replace corporate distributor extraction\n    Given corporate distributors (Sysco, US Foods) extract 400-500% markup between farmer and restaurant\n    And Tom received $0.50/lb for tomatoes distributors sold for $2.50/lb\n    When EAE network enables direct relationships\n    Then Tom receives $1.50/lb for tomatoes (3x previous payment)\n    And restaurants pay $2.00/lb (20% less than through distributor)\n    And both parties benefit massively by eliminating extractive middleman\n    And corporate distributor extraction is replaced by transparent partnership\n    And industry_sector_elohim coordinates direct supply relationships across network\n",
