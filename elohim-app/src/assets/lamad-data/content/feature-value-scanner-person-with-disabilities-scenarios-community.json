Community Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities\n  As a person with disabilities engaging in community organizing and governance\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want my disability advocacy and community-building recognized as essential care work\n  So that disability justice strengthens the entire community's care economy\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim

disability justice, and community organizing\n\n  Scenario: Alex's disability advocacy recognized as sophisticated care work\n    Given Alex performs substantial disability rights organizing\n    And advocacy improves systems for entire disabled community\n    When the community_elohim tracks care contributions\n    Then Alex's advocacy work should accumulate significant care tokens\n    And

standing\n    And the protocol should make visible that advocacy is care work\n    And community should understand Alex is creating public goods\n    And care tokens should reflect the scale of Alex's community impact\n\n  Scenario: Building disability community infrastructure as care economy practice\n    Given Alex works to connect disabled people to each other\n    And peer networks are essential care economy infrastructure\n    When Alex facilitates disability community connections\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize network-building as care work\n    And peer support groups Alex organizes should count as care contribution\n    And accessible events Alex coordinates should accumulate tokens\n    And disability culture-building should be valued appropriately\n    And Alex's infrastructure work strengthens entire care economy\n    And the protocol should see that disability community is care infrastructure\n    And Alex's organizing makes mutual aid possible for others\n\n  Scenario: Policy advocacy improves accessibility for entire community\n    Given Alex advocates for accessibility improvements in public spaces\n    And better accessibility benefits everyone, not just disabled people\n    When community accessibility improves due to Alex's advocacy\n    Then these improvements should be attributed to Alex's care work\n    And the community_elohim should track policy changes Alex influences\n    And curb cuts, accessible transit, universal design benefit whole community\n    And Alex should be recognized as community improver at scale\n    And

protection should be appropriately compensated\n\n  Scenario: Building cross-disability solidarity across different disability communities\n    Given disability community includes diverse disabilities and experiences\n    And Alex works to build solidarity across different disability groups\n    When Alex bridges different disability communities\n    Then coalition-building should be recognized as
