  "content": "Scenario: Identity development beyond student role\n    Given Kenji's identity is currently shaped by being a student\n    And he will graduate and transition to other adult roles\n    When the personal_agent supports Kenji's identity development\n    Then it should recognize him as complete person beyond student status\n    And it should support his interests in environmental science as life calling\n    And it should help him build identity that will persist after graduation\n    And it should validate his current contributions (cooking, care work) as real\n    And the agent should support integrated identity across contexts\n    And Kenji should develop sense of self beyond temporary student role\n",
