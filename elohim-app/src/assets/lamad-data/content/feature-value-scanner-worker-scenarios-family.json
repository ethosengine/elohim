  "content": "Feature: Family Care Participation for Workers\n  As a worker maintaining family connections\n  I need to participate in family care despite employment constraints\n  So that I can honor family relationships while managing work demands\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am a worker with family care responsibilities\n    And my work schedule limits my availability for family\n    And family members are distributed geographically\n    And the family_elohim coordinates care across distance\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining family connection despite limited time\n    Given my work schedule leaves minimal time for family\n    When I want to stay connected to parents and siblings\n    Then the family_elohim should help me maintain meaningful connection\n    And suggest efficient ways to participate in family care\n    And recognize that my work constraints don't diminish my care commitment\n    And coordinate around my limited availability\n\n  Scenario: Contributing to aging parent care from distance\n    Given my parents are aging and need increasing support\n    And I work full-time with unpredictable schedule\n    And I cannot provide hands-on daily care\n    When the family coordinates parent care\n    Then the protocol should help me contribute within my capacity\n    And identify non-time-intensive ways I can support\n    And coordinate with siblings who may have different availability\n    And recognize my contributions even when limited by employment\n\n  Scenario: Supporting family members during crisis\n    Given a family member experiences health crisis or emergency\n    When I want to help but have employment obligations\n    Then the protocol should help me assess my options\n    And coordinate with other family members for coverage\n    And help me communicate with my employer about family needs\n    And support me in balancing work demands with family care\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating financial support for family\n    Given my income is limited but family may need support\n    When family members need financial help\n    Then the protocol should help me assess what I can contribute\n    And coordinate financial support across family network\n    And recognize that my economic constraints are real\n    And facilitate fair distribution of financial responsibility\n\n  Scenario: Sharing care work across sibling network\n    Given siblings may have different capacities for family care\n    And my work schedule limits my hands-on participation\n    When the family needs ongoing care coordination\n    Then the protocol should help distribute care work fairly\n    And recognize that my employment constraints affect availability\n    And identify where I can contribute given my limitations\n    And support negotiation toward equitable family care distribution\n\n  Scenario: Participating in family celebrations despite work\n    Given family gatherings and celebrations matter for connection\n    And my work schedule may conflict with family events\n    When family plans celebrations or important gatherings\n    Then the protocol should help me advocate for work schedule changes\n    And coordinate around my employment constraints when necessary\n    And help me participate meaningfully even if time is limited\n    And recognize that family care includes celebration and joy\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing invisible family care labor\n    Given I provide emotional support, communication, and coordination\n    Even when I cannot provide hands-on care\n    When family members track care contributions\n    Then the protocol should recognize all forms of care work\n    And make visible my emotional labor and communication work\n    And validate that staying connected is valuable care contribution\n    And ensure I am not invisibilized due to employment constraints\n\n  Scenario: Navigating family expectations about availability\n    Given family members may not understand my work constraints\n    When family expects more availability than I can provide\n    Then the protocol should help me communicate my limitations\n    And provide evidence of my actual time and energy constraints\n    And support me in setting realistic boundaries\n    And help family understand that my constraints reflect employment structure not lack of care\n\n  Scenario: Accessing family support during work crisis\n    Given my work demands sometimes become overwhelming\n    When I need family support during difficult work periods\n    Then the protocol should help me ask for help\n    And coordinate family support when I am struggling\n    And enable reciprocity when my situation improves\n    And recognize that care flows both ways in family systems\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating care for family members I support\n    Given I may have dependents or family I support financially\n    When my care responsibilities extend beyond myself\n    Then the protocol should help me coordinate care for dependents\n    And optimize limited resources across family needs\n    And connect me to support systems for working families\n    And recognize that work-family balance requires systemic support\n\n  Scenario: Building family care resilience across generations\n    Given family care needs span generations\n    When family members support each other across life stages\n    Then the protocol should coordinate intergenerational care\n    And recognize contributions from all generations\n    And facilitate sustainable care distribution\n    And support family care economy across time\n\n  Scenario: Documenting family care for workplace advocacy\n    Given family care responsibilities are real and ongoing\n    When I need to advocate for family-friendly workplace policies\n    Then the protocol should help me document family care demands\n    And provide evidence of work-family conflict\n    And support me in requesting accommodations or policy changes\n    And empower me to advocate for care-economy-aligned employment\n",
