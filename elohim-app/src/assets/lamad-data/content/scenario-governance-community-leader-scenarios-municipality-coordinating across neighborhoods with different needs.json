  "content": "Scenario: Coordinating across neighborhoods with different needs\n    Given Riverside has neighborhoods with different priorities\n    And downtown needs economic development\n    And residential areas prioritize environmental protection\n    And outskirts need infrastructure investment\n    When I facilitate municipal coordination\n    Then Municipal Elohim: helps identify resource flows and conflicts\n    And city council: deliberates on balancing neighborhood needs\n    And we ensure: each neighborhood has voice in decisions\n    And we negotiate: resource allocation serving whole city\n    And protocol enables: coordination without centralization\n    And neighborhoods retain: autonomy within municipal framework\n    And I facilitate: democratic negotiation across differences\n",
