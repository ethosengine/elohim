Community Institution Participation and Wealth Circulation for Customer\n  As a customer in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want to participate in democratic community institutions\n  So that consumption builds neighborhood wealth and solidarity\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Ms. Johnson is part of neighborhood served by democratic businesses\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And customer participation shapes community economic development\n\n  Scenario: Customer spending circulates wealth in neighborhood economy\n    Given Ms. Johnson spends $900 annually at democratic ChickenMax/Maria's Kitchen\n    And multiply her spending by hundreds of neighborhood customers\n    When democratic ownership ensures value circulates locally instead of extracting\n    Then $540 of her spending goes to workers who spend in neighborhood\n    And $270 supports community programs benefiting neighbors\n    And $90 funds environmental stewardship protecting local health\n    And aggregate customer spending ($200K+ annually from regulars) massively benefits community\n    And community_elohim documents wealth circulation vs. previous corporate extraction\n\n  Scenario: Customer participates in community stakeholder governance processes\n    Given democratic businesses can include community members in governance\n    And Ms. Johnson has community knowledge and cares about neighborhood\n    When stakeholder participation is offered to engaged customers\n    Then she attends quarterly stakeholder meetings providing input\n    And suggests senior meal program addressing neighborhood isolation\n    And votes on community program priorities (advisory role)\n    And participation connects her individual needs to collective governance\n    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation ensuring worker autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Customer consumption choice influences neighborhood economic development\n    Given community economic development typically means corporate recruitment with subsidies\n    And Ms. Johnson's consumption patterns seemed economically insignificant\n    When democratic businesses demonstrate customer support builds alternative economy\n    Then her choice to support democratic business over corporate chain matters politically\n    And aggregate customer choices determine which business models thrive\n    And consumption becomes vote for economic democracy vs. extraction\n    And neighborhood economy transforms through collective customer choices\n    And community_elohim helps customers understand collective impact of consumption\n\n  Scenario: Customer advocacy spreads democratic business model through community\n    Given Ms. Johnson experiences benefits of democratic business personally\n    And neighbors don't know democratic alternatives exist\n    When satisfied customers share experiences and advocate for democratic businesses\n    Then she tells neighbors about worker ownership and improved quality\n    And brings isolated elders to senior meal program\n    And word-of-mouth advocacy builds customer base for democratic businesses\n    And community awareness of economic democracy grows through customer stories\n    And community_elohim supports customer advocacy and community education\n\n  Scenario: Customer connects to community through democratic business gathering spaces\n    Given neighborhood lacks accessible community gathering spaces\n    And Ms. Johnson experiences isolation common to many residents\n    When democratic businesses serve as community hubs beyond commercial function\n    Then she attends community events at Maria's Kitchen (harvest dinners, neighborhood meetings)\n    And meets neighbors at senior meal program building social networks\n    And participates in community organizing using business space after hours\n    And democratic business becomes social infrastructure combating isolation\n    And community_elohim coordinates community programming at democratic business spaces\n\n  Scenario: Customer learns about supply chain connecting to bioregional food system\n    Given corporate food is anonymous commodity obscuring agricultural connections\n    And Ms. Johnson never thought about where her food came from\n    When democratic transparency reveals supply chain relationships\n    Then she learns about Johnson Farm and Tom's regenerative agriculture\n    And understands her consumption supports farmworkers earning living wages\n    And sees how democratic food system operates bioregionally\n    And consumption connects her to land, ecology, and agricultural labor\n    And community_elohim provides educational supply chain storytelling\n\n  Scenario: Customer benefits from community programs funded by democratic value distribution\n    Given corporate extraction left minimal resources for community benefit\n    And neighborhood needed senior support, youth employment, community space\n    When democratic businesses allocate 30% of revenue to community programs\n    Then Ms. Johnson accesses subsidized senior meals (sliding scale pricing)\n    And neighbors' youth gain employment with dignity and ownership pathway\n    And community space is available for organizing and mutual aid\n    And her patronage funds programs benefiting entire neighborhood\n    And community_elohim manages community benefit distribution ensuring equity\n\n  Scenario: Customer becomes community investor supporting democratic conversions\n    Given Ms. Johnson has modest savings wanting to support community values-aligned\n    And community investment opportunities in democratic businesses exist\n    When she learns neighbors invested in Maria's Kitchen conversion\n    Then she considers investing in next democratic conversion (Rosa's Auto Repair)\n    And investment would provide fair return (5% annually) plus social benefit\n    And her capital would enable worker ownership and community wealth\n    And customer role can expand to investor role if desired\n    And community_elohim manages community investment accessible to customers\n\n  Scenario: Customer experiences neighborhood economic resilience through democratic network\n    Given corporate businesses close arbitrarily based on distant profit calculations\n    And neighborhood institutions disappeared despite community need\n    When democratic businesses are accountable to community not distant shareholders\n    Then businesses remain open serving community even during economic downturns\n    And worker ownership ensures commitment to neighborhood survival\n    And democratic network provides mutual aid during crises\n    And community economic resilience increases through democratic ownership\n    And community_elohim coordinates network resilience strategies\n\n  Scenario: Customer participates in community food sovereignty initiatives\n    Given corporate food system homogenizes diets and ignores cultural preferences\n    And Ms. Johnson's community is diverse with varied cultural food traditions\n    When democratic businesses respond to community cultural food needs\n    Then menu includes diverse cultural options (Latino, Asian, African-American cuisines)\n    And Johnson Farm grows culturally-specific produce based on community requests\n    And food sovereignty increases through democratic responsiveness\n    And cultural food preservation becomes community priority\n    And community_elohim facilitates cultural food sovereignty programming\n\n  Scenario: Customer sees democratic business success encourage other neighborhood conversions\n    Given Ms. Johnson observed Maria's Kitchen conversion and success\n    And neighbors watch to see if democratic model works\n    When democratic business thrives serving community well\n    Then other small business owners (Rosa's Auto, neighborhood retail) consider conversion\n    And successful demonstration effect inspires broader democratic economy\n    And customer support proves democratic businesses are economically viable\n    And neighborhood economic transformation accelerates through cascading conversions\n    And community_elohim documents success stories encouraging further conversions\n\n  Scenario: Customer participates in neighborhood celebration of democratic achievements\n    Given economic development typically celebrates corporate recruitment\n    And democratic conversions deserve community recognition\n    When neighborhood celebrates democratic business milestones\n    Then Ms. Johnson attends public celebrations of worker ownership conversions\n    And community honors workers' ownership and business founders' choices\n    And celebrations build collective pride and solidarity\n    And democratic culture strengthens through community recognition\n    And community_elohim coordinates celebration events amplifying democratic achievements\n",
