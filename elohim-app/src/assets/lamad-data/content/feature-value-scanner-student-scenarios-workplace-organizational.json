Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Student\n  As a student working part-time to support educational and basic needs\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want fair treatment, recognition of my constraints, and care economy awareness\n  So that my work supports rather than undermines my development and well-being\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the student user \"Kenji\" is registered in the system\n    And Kenji works part-time 15 hours per week\n    And Kenji's work income is essential for basic expenses\n    And Kenji must balance work hours with academic demands\n    And Kenji works in service industry (restaurant or retail)\n    And the workplace governance context is active\n    And the workplace_elohim could support worker rights and fair treatment\n    And Kenji is learning to navigate employment for first time\n\n  Scenario: Work schedule flexibility for academic obligations\n    Given Kenji must attend classes and cannot work during certain hours\n    And exam periods require reduced work availability\n    When Kenji's workplace_elohim advocates for schedule flexibility\n    Then it should help Kenji communicate academic constraints to employer\n    And it should support negotiating exam week time off\n    And it should recognize that flexible scheduling is care economy practice\n    And employers should accommodate student educational needs\n    And the system should help Kenji assert right to education\n    And work should support student development, not undermine it\n\n  Scenario: Fair compensation and wage theft prevention\n    Given Kenji depends on every dollar he earns\n    And low-wage employers sometimes violate wage laws\n    When the workplace_elohim monitors Kenji's compensation\n    Then it should verify he's paid for all hours worked\n    And it should flag if he's working off-clock or unpaid\n    And it should teach him to recognize wage theft\n    And it should help him assert right to legal minimum wage\n    And the system should protect vulnerable student workers from exploitation\n    And Kenji should receive every penny he earns\n\n  Scenario: Understanding labor rights as student worker\n    Given Kenji has same labor rights as any employee\n    And many students don't know their workplace rights\n    When the workplace_elohim educates Kenji about labor law\n    Then it should teach him about breaks, overtime, workplace safety\n    And it should inform him of right to organize and unionize\n    And it should help him recognize illegal employer practices\n    And it should empower him to advocate for fair treatment\n    And the system should build Kenji's labor rights literacy\n    And student workers should know and exercise their rights\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing when work serves vs. exploits community needs\n    Given Kenji works in service industry\n    And service work can serve community care or extract from workers\n    When the workplace_elohim helps Kenji analyze his work\n    Then it should help him see whether his work contributes to community flourishing\n    And it should teach him to distinguish care work from extractive labor\n    And it should recognize that serving food can be care economy work\n    And it should help him evaluate whether his workplace aligns with care values\n    And the system should build critical awareness of workplace care economy\n    And Kenji should understand his labor through care economy lens\n\n  Scenario: Workplace relationships and peer support\n    Given Kenji works with other employees, many also students\n    And workplace can be site of mutual support or competition\n    When the workplace_elohim tracks workplace relationships\n    Then it should recognize peer support among coworkers as care work\n    And it should value helping coworkers, sharing shifts, covering emergencies\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for workplace mutual aid\n    And worker solidarity should be understood as care economy\n    And the system should foster cooperative rather than competitive workplace culture\n    And Kenji should build care relationships with fellow workers\n\n  Scenario: Preventing workplace stress from undermining academic success\n    Given Kenji's work adds stress to already-intense academic load\n    And excessive work hours can threaten educational outcomes\n    When the workplace_elohim monitors Kenji's work-study balance\n    Then it should flag when work hours threaten academic performance\n    And it should help him identify when to reduce hours\n    And it should validate that education is his primary work right now\n    And it should support him prioritizing school over work when necessary\n    And the system should prevent work from derailing educational investment\n    And Kenji's long-term development should take precedence over immediate income\n\n  Scenario: Workplace skills as transferable care economy capabilities\n    Given Kenji develops skills through work (customer service, teamwork, reliability)\n    And these capabilities serve him throughout life\n    When the workplace_elohim documents Kenji's skill development\n    Then it should recognize customer service as care economy skill\n    And it should value teamwork, communication, and problem-solving\n    And it should translate work skills to care economy capabilities\n    And it should help Kenji articulate skills for future opportunities\n    And the system should recognize all work as capability development\n    And Kenji should understand his part-time work as building life skills\n\n  Scenario: Employer care economy responsibility to student workers\n    Given Kenji is vulnerable worker with limited experience and options\n    And employers have care economy responsibility to workers\n    When the workplace_elohim evaluates Kenji's workplace\n    Then it should assess whether employer provides fair wages, safe conditions, and flexibility\n    And it should recognize good employers who support student success\n    And it should flag exploitative practices or toxic culture\n    And it should help Kenji identify better employment if current job is harmful\n    And the system should hold employers accountable to care economy standards\n    And workplaces should support student worker flourishing\n\n  Scenario: Emergency work flexibility for student crises\n    Given students face emergencies (illness, family crisis, housing instability)\n    And rigid work schedules can worsen crises\n    When Kenji experiences emergency situation\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help him communicate need for emergency time off\n    And it should advocate for employer flexibility during crisis\n    And it should recognize emergency accommodation as care economy practice\n    And employers should support workers through crises\n    And the system should help Kenji access emergency workplace support\n    And care economy workplaces respond to worker emergencies with flexibility\n\n  Scenario: Preventing employer pressure to prioritize work over education\n    Given some employers pressure students to work more hours\n    And employer interests can conflict with student educational needs\n    When employer requests Kenji increase hours or skip classes for work\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help Kenji maintain boundaries\n    And it should validate his right to prioritize education\n    And it should provide language for declining inappropriate requests\n    And it should recognize that education is his primary work\n    And the system should support students resisting employer overreach\n    And Kenji should have agency to protect his educational investment\n\n  Scenario: Understanding workplace labor as care economy contribution\n    Given Kenji serves food to community members\n    And service work directly contributes to people's daily needs\n    When the workplace_elohim frames his work through care economy\n    Then it should recognize that feeding people is care work\n    And it should value service labor as community care contribution\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for workplace care labor\n    And it should help Kenji see his work as meaningful contribution\n    And the system should dignify service work as care economy participation\n    And Kenji should understand his labor as serving community flourishing\n\n  Scenario: Worker organizing and collective advocacy\n    Given student workers often face systemic workplace problems\n    And collective action can create change\n    When Kenji and coworkers organize for better conditions\n    Then the workplace_elohim should recognize organizing as care economy work\n    And it should support collective advocacy for fair wages and treatment\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for organizing labor\n    And it should protect his right to organize without retaliation\n    And the system should empower student worker collective action\n    And Kenji should learn that workers have power through solidarity\n\n  Scenario: Transitioning work experience to career aligned with care values\n    Given Kenji's current work is survival job, not career goal\n    And he wants future work aligned with environmental care\n    When the workplace_elohim supports career development\n    Then it should help him connect current work skills to future career\n    And it should support him finding work aligned with care economy values\n    And it should recognize his environmental science education as preparing for care work\n    And it should help him transition toward meaningful career\n    And the system should support students developing care-aligned career paths\n    And Kenji's work trajectory should move toward work that serves flourishing\n",
