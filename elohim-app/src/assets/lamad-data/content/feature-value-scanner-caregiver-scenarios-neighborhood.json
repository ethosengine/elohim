Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver\n  As a caregiver needing neighborhood support and connection\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want neighborhood care economy to provide practical support and social connection\n  So that intensive caregiving doesn't result in isolation and unsupported burden\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the caregiver user \"James\" is registered in the system\n    And James cares for David who has early-onset Alzheimer's\n    And James lives in his neighborhood but is increasingly isolated\n    And caregiving consumes most of James's time and energy\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy\n    And James needs practical neighborhood support and human connection\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood awareness of caregiver situation and needs\n    Given many neighbors may not know about James's caregiving burden\n    And invisibility prevents neighbors from offering support\n    When the neighborhood_elohim shares appropriate information\n    Then neighbors should be aware James is providing intensive care\n    And they should understand his situation without violating privacy\n    And awareness should enable neighbors to offer help meaningfully\n    And James should not be invisible in his own neighborhood\n    And caregiver situation should be visible enough to enable support\n\n  Scenario: Practical neighborhood support for isolated caregiver\n    Given James cannot easily leave David alone\n    And small practical tasks become difficult\n    When neighbors offer practical support\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate helpful offers\n    And neighbors could pick up groceries or prescriptions\n    And they could help with yard work or home maintenance\n    And they could check in and provide human connection\n    And practical support should reduce James's isolation\n    And neighborhood mutual aid should serve caregivers actively\n\n  Scenario: Emergency backup support from trusted neighbors\n    Given caregiving emergencies occur unexpectedly\n    And James might need urgent help with David\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates emergency support\n    Then it should identify trusted neighbors for backup\n    And it should ensure neighbors are trained for basic support\n    And emergency contacts should be readily available\n    And neighborhood should provide safety net for crisis\n    And James should have local emergency backup beyond 911\n\n  Scenario: Respite visits from neighbors to prevent social isolation\n    Given James is profoundly socially isolated by caregiving\n    And he desperately needs human connection\n    When neighbors provide respite visits\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate visiting schedules\n    And neighbors could stay with David briefly while James takes walk\n    And they could provide social connection for both James and David\n    And brief respite periods should be regular, not just emergency\n    And neighborhood should actively prevent caregiver isolation\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care token recognition for caregiver contributions\n    Given James contributes to community by caring for David\n    And he's reducing burden on institutional care systems\n    When neighborhood care economy evaluates contributions\n    Then James should accumulate care tokens for caregiving work\n    And neighborhood should recognize his care as community contribution\n    And care tokens should give him standing to access support\n    And caregiving should be valued within neighborhood economy\n    And James should be able to access help based on his contributions\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood understanding prevents stigma around cognitive decline\n    Given David's Alzheimer's may cause concerning behaviors\n    And neighbors might not understand cognitive decline\n    When the neighborhood_elohim provides education\n    Then neighbors should understand Alzheimer's symptoms\n    And they should respond with compassion, not fear\n    And stigma around cognitive decline should be reduced\n    And David should be treated with dignity in neighborhood\n    And neighborhood should be safe and supportive for both James and David\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood respite network for caregiver breaks\n    Given James needs regular breaks or he will burn out\n    And formal respite care is expensive and hard to access\n    When the neighborhood_elohim organizes respite network\n    Then it should coordinate neighbors willing to provide respite\n    And it should schedule regular respite periods for James\n    And neighbors should be trained for basic Alzheimer's care\n    And respite should be reliable and consistent\n    And neighborhood should provide systematic respite support\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood meal support during caregiver crisis periods\n    Given caregiving intensity varies with David's condition\n    And James may have periods of extreme overwhelm\n    When the neighborhood_elohim detects crisis conditions\n    Then it should coordinate meal support from neighbors\n    And meal delivery should be appropriate for David's dietary needs\n    And food support should be dignified, not stigmatizing\n    And neighborhood should provide practical crisis support\n    And James should access help during overwhelming periods\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood walking companionship for caregiver well-being\n    Given James needs exercise and fresh air for his own health\n    And he cannot leave David alone for walks\n    When neighbors offer companionship\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate walking support\n    And neighbors could stay with David while James walks\n    And they could accompany James and David together\n    And regular walks should be protected for James's well-being\n    And neighborhood should actively support caregiver health\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood technology support for overwhelmed caregiver\n    Given James manages complex care coordination systems\n    And technology problems become overwhelming when also caregiving\n    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies tech-skilled neighbors\n    Then neighbors should help with technology issues\n    And they should support James with care coordination tech\n    And technical support should reduce burden, not increase it\n    And neighborhood should include practical technology assistance\n    And James should access help when systems become overwhelming\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood boundaries respect caregiver capacity\n    Given James has extremely limited capacity for neighborhood activities\n    And well-meaning neighbors might make unsustainable demands\n    When the neighborhood_elohim manages expectations\n    Then neighbors should understand James cannot contribute labor currently\n    And they should offer support without expecting reciprocation immediately\n    And James's care work should be recognized as neighborhood contribution\n    And neighborhood should not burden caregivers with additional demands\n    And boundaries should protect James from overwhelming expectations\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood memorial preparation supports anticipatory grief\n    Given David's condition is progressive and terminal\n    And James experiences anticipatory grief constantly\n    When the neighborhood_elohim recognizes grief support needs\n    Then it should connect James to grief support resources\n    And neighbors should be prepared to support through eventual loss\n    And anticipatory grief should be recognized and honored\n    And neighborhood should plan to support James through progressive loss\n    And care relationships should extend through grief and beyond\n",
