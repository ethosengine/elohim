  "content": "Scenario: Studying global inequality in protocol access and benefits\n    Given I hypothesize protocol might exacerbate global inequality\n    And wealthy nations can afford infrastructure poor nations cannot\n    When I analyze distributional effects at global scale\n    Then I examine: adoption rates by national income and infrastructure\n    And I assess: whether benefits flow primarily to Global North\n    And I measure: whether protocol reduces or increases global inequality\n    And I explore: mechanisms of digital colonialism or democratic leveling\n    And I identify: barriers preventing equitable global adoption\n    And I advocate: for international funding and technology transfer\n    And My research serves: global justice by revealing inequities\n",
