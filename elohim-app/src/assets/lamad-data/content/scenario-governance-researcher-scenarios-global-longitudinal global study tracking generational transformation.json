  "content": "Scenario: Longitudinal global study tracking generational transformation\n    Given I study whether protocol transforms civic culture across generations\n    And Tommy's generation is growing up with democratic AI governance\n    When I track generational cohorts over 20-30 years\n    Then I examine: civic capacities (constitutional literacy, deliberation skills)\n    And I assess: political participation and democratic engagement\n    And I measure: relationship to AI and technology\n    And I explore: whether growing up with protocol creates different citizenship\n    And I analyze: intergenerational transmission of democratic culture\n    And I investigate: whether protocol's effects compound across generations\n    And My research captures: civilizational transformation over human timescales\n",
