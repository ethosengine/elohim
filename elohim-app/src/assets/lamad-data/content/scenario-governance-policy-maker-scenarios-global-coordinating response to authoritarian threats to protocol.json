  "content": "Scenario: Coordinating response to authoritarian threats to protocol\n    Given authoritarian regimes may attack protocol infrastructure\n    And democratic nations must respond collectively\n    When I participate in democratic coalition\n    Then we share: threat intelligence and defensive strategies\n    And we coordinate: mutual support for communities under threat\n    And we establish: sanctuary systems for protocol refugees\n    And we resist: authoritarian pressure through solidarity\n    And we provide: resources for communities defending sovereignty\n    And we demonstrate: that democracy protects itself\n    And we show: authoritarian capture is not inevitable\n",
