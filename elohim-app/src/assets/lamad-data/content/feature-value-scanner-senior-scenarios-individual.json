Individual Layer Value Recognition for Senior\n  As a senior in early retirement (ages 65-74) in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want my personal autonomy, dignity, and care contributions to be recognized\n  So that retirement is experienced as liberation for care work, not obsolescence\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the senior user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret is 68 years old, retired from nursing\n    And Margaret lives on fixed income of $32k/year\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Margaret's personal_agent is configured for dignity preservation\n    And the interface is optimized for accessibility needs\n\n  Scenario: Accessible interface design respects aging-related needs\n    Given Margaret is using the Value Scanner\n    And she has age-related vision and dexterity changes\n    When Margaret opens the scanner application\n    Then the interface should display large, high-contrast fonts\n    And touch targets should be large and forgiving\n    And voice interface options should be available\n    And navigation should be simple and consistent\n    And no time-limited interactions should be required\n    And the pace should be patient without being patronizing\n    And the interface should feel respectful and empowering\n    And cognitive load should be minimized\n\n  Scenario: Managing fixed income with dignity and sophistication\n    Given Margaret has a $150/week grocery budget\n    And her income is fixed and cannot be increased through employment\n    When Margaret plans her shopping\n    Then her personal_agent should provide sophisticated budgeting tools\n    And it should identify sales and optimize value per dollar\n    And it should track spending across weeks for pattern analysis\n    And it should suggest resource optimization without stigma\n    And it should help her maintain quality of life within constraints\n    And the framing should be dignity-preserving, not scarcity-shaming\n    And Margaret should experience agency, not deprivation\n\n  Scenario: Tracking changing nutritional needs for health management\n    Given Margaret is managing early-stage diabetes\n    And she needs more protein and calcium, less sodium\n    And medications affect her appetite and digestion\n    When Margaret shops for groceries\n    Then her personal_agent should track nutrition across time\n    And it should suggest foods appropriate for her health conditions\n    And it should flag items high in sodium or sugar\n    And it should highlight protein and calcium-rich options\n    And it should help her balance health needs with budget constraints\n    And nutritional guidance should feel supportive, not controlling\n    And Margaret should maintain agency over food choices\n\n  Scenario: Making retirement care contributions visible at individual level\n    Given Margaret provides 15 hours/week grandchild care\n    And she volunteers 10 hours/week in community\n    And she provides 8 hours/week elder care for her mother\n    When Margaret's care contributions are tracked\n    Then her personal_agent should quantify all care labor\n    And it should calculate market value (~$15k/year grandchild care)\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for all contributions\n    And it should make visible that she's highly productive\n    And Margaret should experience herself as valuable contributor\n    And the data should counter cultural narrative of retired as \"not working\"\n    And her contributions should be recognized, not invisible\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent serves Margaret's autonomy without infantilizing\n    Given Margaret is a capable adult with decades of life experience\n    And the interface uses AI assistance\n    When the personal_agent interacts with Margaret\n    Then it must preserve her full autonomy and dignity\n    And it must never be patronizing or infantilizing\n    And it must respect her expertise and judgment\n    And it must provide information, not directives\n    And it must acknowledge her nursing background and competence\n    And the relationship should be respectful partnership\n    And Margaret should feel empowered, never managed\n\n  Scenario: Building care economy capital for future aging needs\n    Given Margaret is watching her 92-year-old mother navigate advanced aging\n    And Margaret recognizes her own future care needs\n    When Margaret makes care contributions now\n    Then care tokens should accumulate to her individual account\n    And these tokens should represent future care economy resources\n    And the system should help her build reciprocal relationships\n    And she should be preparing for increased care needs in 10-20 years\n    And current contributions should create future security\n    And Margaret should experience agency in planning her own aging\n\n  Scenario: Privacy control remains with Margaret as autonomous adult\n    Given Margaret's care contribution data is being tracked\n    And health information is particularly sensitive\n    When Margaret determines data sharing preferences\n    Then she must have complete control over all her data\n    And she should choose what's shared with family, doctors, or community\n    And she can demonstrate care value to family if she wishes\n    And she can maintain complete privacy if she prefers\n    And health data sharing must be explicitly consented\n    And Margaret's autonomy over her information must be absolute\n\n  Scenario: Medication interactions and dietary considerations tracked\n    Given Margaret takes multiple medications\n    And medications interact with certain foods\n    When Margaret shops for groceries\n    Then her personal_agent should be aware of medication interactions\n    And it should flag potentially problematic food-drug combinations\n    And it should suggest foods that support medication effectiveness\n    And medication data should remain private and encrypted\n    And the system should support her health management\n    And Margaret should feel supported in complex health navigation\n\n  Scenario: Reducing food waste with fixed income constraints\n    Given Margaret's budget requires maximizing every dollar\n    And food waste represents meaningful lost resources\n    When Margaret plans meals and shopping\n    Then her personal_agent should help minimize waste\n    And it should suggest appropriate portion sizes for one or two people\n    And it should track perishables and suggest usage timing\n    And it should recommend preservation techniques Margaret knows from experience\n    And waste reduction should align with both budget and values\n    And Margaret's generation's knowledge of frugality should be honored\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining independence through effective resource management\n    Given Margaret values her independence\n    And she wants to avoid becoming \"a burden\"\n    When Margaret uses the Value Scanner over time\n    Then it should help her maintain self-sufficiency\n    And it should optimize her resources for maximum independence\n    And it should connect her to community resources without stigma\n    And it should make her care contributions visible\n    And Margaret should experience continued agency and autonomy\n    And the system should support her in aging on her own terms\n\n  Scenario: Recognition of unpaid care labor builds self-worth\n    Given Margaret's care contributions are substantial but unpaid\n    And traditional economics labels her as \"not working\"\n    When Margaret reviews her care contribution data\n    Then she should see quantified value of her labor\n    And she should understand her economic contribution is significant\n    And she should experience herself as productive member of society\n    And the narrative of retirement as obsolescence should be countered\n    And Margaret should have data to assert her value\n    And her dignity and self-worth should be affirmed\n\n  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained throughout system\n    Given Margaret participates in the Value Scanner\n    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers\n    When Margaret chooses to disconnect from the system\n    Then her choice must be honored immediately\n    And all data retention must follow minimal legal requirements\n    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed\n    And Margaret's right to not participate must be absolute\n    And her autonomy over technology use must be respected\n    And disconnection should be simple and complete\n",
