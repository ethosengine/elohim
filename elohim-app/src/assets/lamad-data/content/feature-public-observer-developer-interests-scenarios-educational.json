Educational Impact Accountability for Developer Interests\n  As a developer in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want honest school impact analysis and genuine mitigation\n  So that development serves families not just extracts from school systems\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the developer_interests user is registered in the system\n    And the educational governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Developer receives honest school capacity analysis\n    Given a developer proposes 300-unit residential development\n    And claims it will bring tax revenue benefiting schools\n    When the Observer provides independent school impact analysis\n    Then the developer sees: project will generate 180 school-age children\n    And local elementary school is already at 95% capacity\n    And district needs $12M to expand capacity for projected enrollment\n    And property tax revenue is $800K/year but school costs are $1.5M/year\n    And honest analysis reveals net burden on school system\n\n  Scenario: Responsible developer partners with district for school capacity\n    Given a developer understands project will strain school capacity\n    And wants to genuinely address educational impacts\n    When the Observer facilitates developer-district partnership\n    Then the developer negotiates: $3M contribution to school expansion\n    And commits land for future school site if district needs it\n    And provides temporary modular classrooms during construction of expansion\n    And partnership creates genuine school capacity not just promises\n    And responsible development addresses community needs\n\n  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for school impact promises\n    Given a developer claimed previous project would \"support local schools\"\n    And implied tax revenue would benefit education\n    When the Observer tracks actual school impacts\n    Then analysis shows: enrollment increased 120 students\n    And district had to add 6 portable classrooms\n    And property tax revenue was $400K but school costs were $900K annually\n    And promised \"school support\" was marketing not actual benefit\n    And accountability creates pressure for honest impact assessment\n\n  Scenario: Developer affordable housing benefits school stability\n    Given a responsible developer builds genuinely affordable housing\n    And prioritizes families over luxury apartments\n    When the Observer tracks educational community impacts\n    Then analysis shows: stable affordable housing reduces student mobility\n    And children in affordable housing have better educational outcomes\n    And schools benefit from stable enrollment not constant turnover\n    And affordable development creates educational community benefit\n    And genuine affordability serves families not just developer profit\n\n  Scenario: Developer luxury housing accelerates school gentrification\n    Given a developer builds high-end housing in gentrifying neighborhood\n    And displacement impacts working-class families\n    When the Observer analyzes school enrollment changes\n    Then analysis shows: low-income student enrollment dropped 40%\n    And school demographics shifted from 70% to 35% students of color\n    And affordable family housing converted to luxury units\n    And development accelerated displacement affecting educational equity\n    And gentrification impacts on schools become visible and challengeable\n\n  Scenario: Developer school impact fees gain accountability\n    Given a developer paid $1.2M in school impact fees\n    And fees were supposed to address enrollment impacts\n    When the Observer tracks how district used impact fees\n    Then analysis shows: fees went to general operations not capacity expansion\n    And school still lacks capacity to serve development's students\n    And impact fee mechanism failed to actually mitigate impacts\n    And accountability creates pressure for effective mitigation requirements\n    And communities demand better school impact policy\n\n  Scenario: Developer childcare commitment becomes enforceable\n    Given a developer promised on-site childcare facility as community benefit\n    And families counted on childcare when development was approved\n    When the Observer tracks community benefit delivery\n    Then monitoring shows: childcare space was never built\n    And developer converted it to retail space increasing revenue\n    And families who moved to development lack promised childcare\n    And broken commitment affects working families' ability to afford housing\n    And accountability creates real consequences for unkept promises\n\n  Scenario: Developer school partnership creates genuine community benefit\n    Given a responsible developer wants to genuinely support education\n    And recognizes development affects school community\n    When the Observer facilitates school-developer partnership\n    Then the developer commits: after-school program space in community building\n    And provides scholarship fund for district students\n    And employs district graduates in construction and property management\n    And partnership creates lasting educational community benefit\n    And genuine engagement distinguishes from token gestures\n",
