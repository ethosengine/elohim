Family Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult\n  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want to coordinate care flows across multiple households and four generations\n  So that family care responsibilities are distributed equitably and all family members flourish\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the middle-aged user \"Robert\" is registered in the system\n    And Robert is 52 years old\n    And his family spans four generations: grandchildren, children ages 19 and 22, himself and spouse, parents ages 78 and 75\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy\n    And family members live across three states\n\n  Scenario: Multigenerational care coordination across distributed family\n    Given Robert's parents live in Florida\n    And his children attend college in different states\n    And his grandchild occasionally needs care\n    And Robert's siblings share parent care responsibilities\n    When family_elohim coordinates care across geography\n    Then it should track care needs across multiple households\n    And coordinate with Robert's siblings on parent care distribution\n    And help Robert support his children remotely\n    And manage occasional grandchild care\n    And surface conflicts across generational needs\n    And provide sophisticated coordination across distance\n    And ensure no household or person is overwhelmed\n\n  Scenario: Parent care coordinated equitably with siblings\n    Given Robert's parents require increasing care support\n    And Robert has two siblings: Sarah and Michael\n    And care coordination across siblings is often fraught\n    When family_elohim coordinates sibling care contributions\n    Then it should track each sibling's care contributions\n    And make contributions visible to all siblings\n    And surface when distribution becomes inequitable\n    And facilitate discussion: \"Robert has handled 65% of medical coordination this quarter\"\n    And help siblings negotiate fair distribution based on capacity\n    And prevent resentment from invisible labor imbalances\n    And support siblings in maintaining relationships while coordinating care\n\n  Scenario: Adult children supported in independence while teaching care economy\n    Given Robert's children ages 19 and 22 are establishing independence\n    And Robert provides financial support, guidance, and care economy education\n    When family_elohim tracks the parent-adult child relationship\n    Then it should recognize Robert's support contributions\n    And help him teach care economy principles to his children\n    And surface opportunities: \"Jordan could help coordinate grandmother's birthday celebration\"\n    And model multigenerational care reciprocity for the next generation\n    And support the transition from parenting to adult partnership\n    And help his children learn that care flows in multiple directions\n    And prepare them to eventually care for him\n\n  Scenario: Elder care financial coordination across family\n    Given Robert's parents' care costs are increasing\n    And long-term care may eventually be needed\n    And financial planning needs to involve siblings\n    When family_elohim coordinates elder care financing\n    Then it should help siblings discuss financial responsibility\n    And surface each sibling's capacity to contribute financially\n    And track actual financial contributions to parent care\n    And help coordinate long-term care insurance, Medicare, and family support\n    And ensure parents' dignity is protected in financial discussions\n    And prevent financial burden from falling entirely on one sibling\n    And support transparent, equitable financial planning\n\n  Scenario: Grandparent role supported as new generation emerges\n    Given Robert occasionally provides care for his grandchild\n    And he's learning the grandparent role\n    And his care enables his adult child to work\n    When family_elohim tracks grandparent care contributions\n    Then it should recognize grandparent care as valuable family contribution\n    And help Robert understand his role in the four-generation family\n    And support him in providing care without overstepping parenting boundaries\n    And recognize that his grandparent care enables the middle generation\n    And value his care appropriately in family care economy\n    And help him see himself as part of ongoing care reciprocity\n    And model care patterns for when he'll need care\n\n  Scenario: Family communication facilitated across generations and geography\n    Given family members are distributed across states\n    And communication about care needs is essential but complex\n    And family discussions about care can be emotionally difficult\n    When family_elohim supports family communication\n    Then it should provide structured communication tools\n    And facilitate difficult conversations about elder care, finances, and support\n    And ensure all relevant family members have voice\n    And help family navigate emotional complexity of care discussions\n    And support family in making collaborative decisions\n    And prevent communication breakdowns that harm care coordination\n    And maintain family cohesion amid care demands\n\n  Scenario: Family care tokens reflect four-generation care flows\n    Given care flows in multiple directions across the family\n    And Robert receives support from siblings and provides support to parents and children\n    And care contributions need to be recognized across all flows\n    When family_elohim calculates family care tokens\n    Then it should track care across all four generations\n    And recognize Robert's care for parents and support for children\n    And value siblings' parent care contributions\n    And recognize adult children's emerging care contributions\n    And track grandparent care across the family\n    And make visible the complex web of family care reciprocity\n    And demonstrate that family functions through mutual care\n\n  Scenario: Family governance decisions made collaboratively\n    Given family faces major decisions about parent care\n    And decisions affect multiple family members\n    And Robert's voice carries weight but shouldn't dominate\n    When family_elohim facilitates governance decisions\n    Then it should support collaborative family decision-making\n    And ensure Robert's parents have voice in their own care\n    And include siblings in care planning decisions\n    And respect adult children's emerging voice in family governance\n    And help family navigate power dynamics and competing needs\n    And support decisions that honor all family members' wellbeing\n    And prevent decisions that sacrifice one generation for another\n\n  Scenario: Elder care planning anticipates increasing needs\n    Given Robert's parents are ages 78 and 75\n    And their care needs will likely increase\n    And family should plan proactively rather than react to crises\n    When family_elohim supports elder care planning\n    Then it should help family anticipate future care needs\n    And surface: \"Medical patterns suggest increased care needs likely within 2-3 years\"\n    And support family in discussing long-term care options\n    And help siblings plan for potential crisis scenarios\n    And ensure parents are included in planning with dignity\n    And coordinate financial, medical, and housing planning\n    And prevent family crisis from lack of preparation\n\n  Scenario: Family care boundaries prevent burnout and exploitation\n    Given Robert carries substantial family care burden\n    And family care can become exploitative even with good intentions\n    When family_elohim monitors care burden\n    Then it should flag when Robert's care contributions exceed sustainable levels\n    And recognize if siblings are not contributing equitably\n    And surface if parents' needs are overwhelming family capacity\n    And prompt discussion when external support is needed\n    And protect Robert from being expected to handle everything\n    And support family in recognizing when professional care is appropriate\n    And ensure family care operates on reciprocity, not exploitation\n\n  Scenario: Family history and care patterns made visible across generations\n    Given care patterns often repeat across generations\n    And Robert learned care from his parents' care for their parents\n    And he's modeling care for the next generation\n    When family_elohim surfaces family care history\n    Then it should help Robert see multigenerational care patterns\n    And recognize: \"Your parents provided similar care for your grandparents\"\n    And surface how his current care teaches his children\n    And connect past care received to present care given to future care needed\n    And help family understand care as lifecycle reciprocity\n    And validate that Robert's care continues family care traditions\n    And prepare next generation to provide care when Robert needs it\n\n  Scenario: Family privacy boundaries negotiated across generations\n    Given family coordination requires information sharing\n    And family members have legitimate need for privacy\n    And Robert manages sensitive information about parents and children\n    When family_elohim manages privacy\n    Then it should enable coordination while protecting privacy\n    And Robert should control what information he shares about his household\n    And parents should maintain privacy about their health and finances\n    And adult children should control their own information sharing\n    And siblings should have access to parent care information\n    And family care coordination should not violate individual privacy\n    And privacy boundaries should be negotiable and respectful\n",
