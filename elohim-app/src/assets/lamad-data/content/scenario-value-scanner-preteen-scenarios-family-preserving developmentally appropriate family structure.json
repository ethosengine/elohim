  "content": "Scenario: Preserving developmentally appropriate family structure\n    Given Marcus has adult-level responsibilities\n    And he is still a 12-year-old child\n    When family dynamics are shaped by care economy\n    Then the family_elohim should work to preserve appropriate boundaries\n    And Marcus should not become de facto parent\n    And Sarah should remain ultimate authority and protector\n    And age-appropriate childhood should be preserved where possible\n    And the protocol should prevent role reversal damage\n    And family structure should remain as healthy as circumstances allow\n",
