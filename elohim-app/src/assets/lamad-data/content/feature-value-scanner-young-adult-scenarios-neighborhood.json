Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult\n  As a young adult new to my neighborhood\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want to build community connections through care participation\n  So that I establish roots and mutual support networks in a new place\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the young_adult user \"Aisha\" is registered in the system\n    And Aisha recently moved to a new city for work\n    And Aisha is learning her new neighborhood\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy\n    And Aisha wants to build community from scratch\n\n  Scenario: Discovering neighborhood through care economy participation\n    Given Aisha is new to her neighborhood\n    And she doesn't know local patterns yet\n    When Aisha explores neighborhood resources\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should surface local care opportunities\n    And it should identify local shops and services\n    And it should highlight community initiatives she can join\n    And the system should help her learn neighborhood geography through care\n    And community building should happen through participation\n    And she should discover her neighborhood as care network, not just location\n\n  Scenario: Connecting with neighbors through shared shopping\n    Given Aisha shops at local grocery stores\n    And other neighbors shop at the same stores\n    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies potential connections\n    Then it should suggest connecting with nearby residents\n    And it should surface bulk buying opportunities\n    And it should facilitate resource sharing among neighbors\n    And introductions should be based on mutual care interests\n    And the system should help build neighborhood relationships organically\n    And community should form through practical cooperation\n\n  Scenario: Joining neighborhood meal prep group\n    Given a meal prep group is forming in Aisha's neighborhood\n    And joining would reduce her time pressure and build community\n    When the neighborhood_elohim surfaces the opportunity\n    Then it should highlight the practical benefits\n    And it should show how it fits her budget and time constraints\n    And it should explain the care economy dimension\n    And the system should facilitate her joining process\n    And neighborhood participation should provide tangible value\n    And community building should solve real problems\n\n  Scenario: Contributing to neighborhood care economy as newcomer\n    Given Aisha is new and has few connections\n    And she wants to establish herself in the community\n    When Aisha contributes to neighborhood initiatives\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should track her contributions\n    And it should make her care work visible to neighbors\n    And it should help her build social capital through care\n    And early contributions should establish her as community participant\n    And the system should help newcomers integrate through care economy\n    And belonging should be earned through reciprocal care\n\n  Scenario: Learning local shopping patterns from neighborhood data\n    Given Aisha doesn't know the best local stores yet\n    And neighborhood residents have collective knowledge\n    When Aisha plans shopping trips\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should share aggregated local knowledge\n    And it should identify best value stores for different items\n    And it should suggest efficient shopping routes\n    And it should reflect collective neighborhood wisdom\n    And newcomers should benefit from community knowledge\n    And local expertise should be shared through the system\n\n  Scenario: Accessing neighborhood resource sharing networks\n    Given neighbors share tools and resources\n    And Aisha occasionally needs items she doesn't own\n    When Aisha needs to borrow something\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect her to resource sharing\n    And it should facilitate tool libraries and sharing arrangements\n    And it should track care tokens for borrowing and lending\n    And the system should build neighborhood mutual aid\n    And resource sharing should reduce individual costs\n    And neighborhood cooperation should meet practical needs\n\n  Scenario: Participating in neighborhood sustainability initiatives\n    Given the neighborhood has sustainability projects\n    And Aisha wants to reduce environmental impact\n    When Aisha joins local sustainability efforts\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate her participation\n    And it should connect her to composting, recycling, or garden projects\n    And it should recognize her environmental care work\n    And neighborhood-level sustainability should be more effective than individual\n    And collective action should be facilitated through care economy\n    And environmental stewardship should build community\n\n  Scenario: Building neighborhood safety through mutual care\n    Given neighborhoods are safer when residents know each other\n    And Aisha wants to feel secure in her new home\n    When Aisha participates in neighborhood care networks\n    Then the connections should build mutual familiarity\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should strengthen social fabric\n    And care relationships should create natural neighborhood watch\n    And safety should emerge from community bonds\n    And the system should build security through care, not surveillance\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care economy helps young adult on tight budget\n    Given Aisha has limited financial resources\n    And neighborhood cooperation can reduce costs\n    When Aisha participates in neighborhood care economy\n    Then bulk buying should reduce her grocery costs\n    And resource sharing should reduce acquisition needs\n    And skill exchanges should replace paid services\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should identify cost-saving opportunities\n    And community participation should improve financial sustainability\n    And care economy should make tight budgets more livable\n\n  Scenario: Learning neighborhood cultural context through participation\n    Given Aisha's neighborhood has particular cultural character\n    And she's learning local norms and values\n    When Aisha engages neighborhood care economy\n    Then she should learn cultural patterns through participation\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should respect local culture\n    And her contributions should adapt to neighborhood context\n    And cultural integration should happen through care relationships\n    And the system should facilitate culturally appropriate participation\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood connection reduces isolation for young adult\n    Given Aisha moved to a new city alone\n    And social isolation is a risk for young adults\n    When Aisha builds neighborhood care relationships\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate meaningful connections\n    And care-based relationships should reduce loneliness\n    And practical cooperation should create authentic community\n    And the system should address isolation through care economy\n    And neighborhood bonds should provide social support\n    And belonging should emerge from reciprocal care\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood governance participation as new resident\n    Given the neighborhood makes collective decisions\n    And Aisha is a new resident\n    When neighborhood governance processes occur\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate her participation\n    And newcomers should have voice proportional to care contributions\n    And she should learn how neighborhood decision-making works\n    And participation should be accessible to new residents\n    And the system should help her become active neighborhood citizen\n    And care economy should give her legitimate standing in governance\n",
