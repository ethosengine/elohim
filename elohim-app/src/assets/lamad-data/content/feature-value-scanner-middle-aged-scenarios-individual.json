Individual Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult\n  As a middle-aged adult (ages 46-64) in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want to maintain individual autonomy and identity amid peak care demands\n  So that I can sustain my own flourishing while serving complex multigenerational care responsibilities\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the middle-aged user \"Robert\" is registered in the system\n    And Robert is 52 years old\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Robert's personal_agent is configured for sophisticated coordination\n    And Robert has children ages 19 and 22 and parents ages 78 and 75\n    And Robert works as a mid-level manager with substantial professional responsibilities\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent coordinates overwhelming complexity across four generations\n    Given Robert manages care responsibilities across four generations\n    And he tracks his parents' medical appointments and medications\n    And he provides financial support and guidance to his adult children\n    And he maintains his own household with his spouse\n    And he occasionally provides care for his grandchild\n    When Robert uses his personal_agent for coordination\n    Then the agent should maintain awareness of all contexts simultaneously\n    And surface conflicts: \"Your father's cardiology appointment conflicts with your work presentation\"\n    And help him prioritize: \"Jordan's apartment deposit is due before your mother's prescription refill\"\n    And reduce cognitive load by holding details he can't track alone\n    And provide sophisticated decision support across multiple time horizons\n    And function as genuine coordination partner for managing extreme complexity\n\n  Scenario: Individual identity protected amid overwhelming care demands\n    Given Robert's care responsibilities could consume all available time\n    And he risks losing individual identity to caregiver role\n    When Robert's personal_agent monitors his wellbeing\n    Then it should protect space for his own flourishing\n    And flag if care demands are eliminating personal time\n    And surface when he needs rest, recreation, or personal development\n    And recognize: \"You haven't had time for yourself in 17 days\"\n    And help him understand that his own wellbeing enables sustainable care\n    And validate that maintaining individual identity is not selfishness\n    And support him in setting boundaries that preserve his personhood\n\n  Scenario: Health monitoring as Robert recognizes his own aging\n    Given Robert is experiencing early signs of aging\n    And he watches his parents navigate health challenges\n    And he recognizes his own future care needs\n    When Robert tracks his health through his personal_agent\n    Then it should monitor age-related health indicators\n    And help him establish preventive health practices\n    And connect his parents' health patterns to his own future\n    And support planning for his own eventual care needs\n    And recognize: \"Regular exercise now reduces future care burden\"\n    And help him build health practices that will serve him as he ages\n    And prepare him for the transition from care provider to care receiver\n\n  Scenario: Financial autonomy maintained while supporting multiple generations\n    Given Robert provides financial support to children\n    And he contributes to parents' long-term care costs\n    And he maintains his household\n    And he saves for his own retirement\n    When his personal_agent analyzes his financial situation\n    Then it should help him balance competing financial demands\n    And protect his own financial security\n    And surface when generational support threatens his retirement\n    And provide analysis: \"Continuing current support level will delay retirement by 3 years\"\n    And help him make informed tradeoffs\n    And ensure he doesn't sacrifice his own future for present generational needs\n    And support sustainable multigenerational financial planning\n\n  Scenario: Career development balanced with peak care responsibilities\n    Given Robert has substantial professional responsibilities\n    And his care demands are also at peak levels\n    And he has opportunities for career advancement\n    When Robert considers professional development opportunities\n    Then his personal_agent should help him assess realistic capacity\n    And analyze: \"This promotion would add 10 hours weekly with your parents needing increased care\"\n    And support him in making career decisions that honor his full life context\n    And help him recognize that care responsibilities are legitimate constraints on career\n    And surface when career advancement would create unsustainable burden\n    And validate that choosing care over career advancement is reasonable\n    And ensure he doesn't sacrifice relationships for professional success\n\n  Scenario: Personal values clarified through complex care decisions\n    Given Robert makes difficult decisions about care allocation\n    And he must choose between competing legitimate needs\n    When he faces value conflicts through his personal_agent\n    Then it should help him articulate his core values\n    And surface patterns in his decisions\n    And recognize: \"You've consistently prioritized parent care over children's wants\"\n    And support him in examining whether his choices align with his values\n    And provide space for reflection on what matters most\n    And help him develop coherent personal philosophy about care responsibilities\n    And respect his authority to define his own values\n\n  Scenario: Stress and burnout monitoring with proactive intervention\n    Given Robert carries enormous care burden across contexts\n    And middle-aged adults often experience burnout\n    And he may not recognize his own exhaustion\n    When his personal_agent monitors stress indicators\n    Then it should track signs of burnout across his activities\n    And recognize patterns: \"You've canceled personal activities 8 consecutive weeks\"\n    And flag when burden becomes unsustainable\n    And proactively surface support resources\n    And connect him to respite care, counseling, or community support\n    And validate that asking for help is strength, not weakness\n    And intervene before burnout becomes crisis\n\n  Scenario: Privacy controls for managing sensitive cross-generational information\n    Given Robert manages his parents' sensitive health and financial data\n    And he coordinates care with his siblings\n    And he supports his adult children while respecting their privacy\n    When Robert configures privacy settings\n    Then he should have granular control over information flows\n    And his parents' health data should be protected\n    And his children's information should remain private\n    And family care coordination should share only relevant data\n    And his workplace should not access family health information\n    And community governance should see his care contributions without sensitive details\n    And privacy boundaries should protect all parties' dignity\n\n  Scenario: Preparing for role reversal as parent-child relationship evolves\n    Given Robert's parents increasingly need his care\n    And he remembers them caring for him as a child\n    And he recognizes his children will someday care for him\n    When Robert reflects on lifecycle care patterns\n    Then his personal_agent should help him navigate the emotional complexity\n    And surface the reciprocity: \"Your parents cared for you, you care for them, your children will care for you\"\n    And support him in maintaining his parents' dignity as he assumes care responsibilities\n    And help him model dignified care receiving for his children\n    And recognize that role reversal is natural lifecycle transition\n    And validate the grief and complexity of watching parents age\n    And prepare him for his own eventual care needs\n\n  Scenario: Building care economy leadership through accumulated experience\n    Given Robert has decades of care economy participation\n    And he has learned what works and what doesn't\n    And his position gives him influence\n    When Robert considers care economy leadership opportunities\n    Then his personal_agent should recognize his accumulated expertise\n    And surface opportunities: community boards, policy advocacy, mentoring\n    And help him understand that his experience is valuable wisdom\n    And connect him to platforms where his voice can influence systems\n    And support him in translating personal experience into system improvement\n    And recognize that his generation can drive care economy transformation\n\n  Scenario: Learning from care economy participation across life stages\n    Given Robert has participated in care economy as child, parent, and adult child\n    And he now sees care patterns across the full lifecycle\n    When his personal_agent helps him reflect on his care economy journey\n    Then it should surface insights from his accumulated experience\n    And help him recognize: \"You learned care reciprocity from your parents' care for their parents\"\n    And connect past care received to present care given\n    And support him in understanding care as lifecycle reciprocity\n    And validate that his care contributions across decades have genuine value\n    And help him see that he's building care economy that will serve his own aging\n    And recognize his whole life as care economy participation\n\n  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained despite complex commitments\n    Given Robert has extensive care economy commitments\n    And many people depend on his coordination\n    And constitutional constraints protect his agency\n    When Robert chooses to disconnect from the system\n    Then the disconnection must be honored immediately\n    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed\n    And his care contributions should be exportable in standard format\n    And alternative coordination support should be surfaced for those who depend on him\n    And his right to not participate must be respected\n    And he should maintain full control over his participation\n",
