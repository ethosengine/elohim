  "content": "Scenario: Global research network coordinating cross-cultural studies\n    Given protocol has been adopted in diverse nations worldwide\n    And I am part of international research consortium\n    When we coordinate parallel studies across continents\n    Then we examine: how cultural context shapes constitutional interpretation\n    And we compare: collectivist vs individualist societies' implementations\n    And we analyze: different political systems' integration patterns\n    And we identify: universal patterns vs cultural adaptations\n    And we share: methodologies and data (with appropriate protection)\n    And we test: whether democratic AI governance is Western innovation or universal possibility\n    And Our global collaboration reveals: humanity's shared and diverse governance approaches\n",
