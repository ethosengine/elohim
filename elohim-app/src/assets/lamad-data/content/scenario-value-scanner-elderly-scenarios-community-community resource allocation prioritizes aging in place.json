  "content": "Scenario: Community resource allocation prioritizes aging in place\n    Given community resources are limited\n    And policy choices affect elder care\n    When community governance makes allocation decisions\n    Then the community_elohim should surface elder needs\n    And aging in place should be prioritized over institutionalization\n    And Helen's voice should be included in community decisions\n    And resources should flow to enable dignity-preserving care\n    And the protocol should inform community policy\n    And care economy data should demonstrate what elders need to flourish\n    And community should invest in infrastructure that serves all ages\n",
