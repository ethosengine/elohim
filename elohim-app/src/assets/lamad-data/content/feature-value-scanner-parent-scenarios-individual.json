You need support.\"\n    And it should connect her to respite resources\n    And it should help her identify what must give\n    And crisis intervention should be immediate and clear\n    And the system should prioritize her survival over perfection\n\n  Scenario: Care token accumulation reflects totality of invisible labor\n    Given Sarah performs mental labor and physical labor continuously\n    And traditional economics renders her household work invisible\n    When the Value Scanner tracks Sarah's care contributions\n    Then care tokens should accumulate for meal planning, not just cooking\n    And tokens should reflect coordinating schedules, managing inventory, teaching values\n    And emotional labor should be valued alongside physical tasks\n    And the full complexity of parenting work should be quantified\n    And Sarah's care token balance should reflect her enormous contributions\n    And invisible care labor should become economically visible\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent serves as cognitive partner for impossible complexity\n    Given Sarah must coordinate Tommy's wonder-preservation with Emma's autonomy-building\n    And also manage budget, nutrition, schedules, and her work responsibilities\n    When Sarah uses her personal_agent for decision support\n    Then the agent should hold all relevant factors simultaneously\n    And it should surface conflicts: \"Tommy needs experiential learning but you have 20 minutes before work\"\n    And it should suggest realistic solutions within constraints\n    And it should reduce cognitive load dramatically\n    And Sarah should experience genuine partnership\n    And the agent should make impossible complexity manageable\n\n  Scenario: Individual flourishing metrics beyond caregiving productivity\n    Given Sarah's value extends far beyond care productivity\n    And she is a complete person deserving of flourishing\n    When the system measures Sarah's well-being\n    Then it should track her joy, rest, creative expression, and growth\n    And it should measure whether she's experiencing life beyond caregiving\n    And it should flag if she has no non-caregiving identity markers\n    And individual flourishing should be valued as essential\n    And Sarah should be supported in being whole, not just productive\n    And the care economy should enable her complete humanity\n\n  Scenario: Privacy protection for parent's personal life\n    Given Sarah's care work generates extensive data\n    And she has full privacy rights as an individual\n    When care economy data is collected\n    Then Sarah must have complete control over her personal information\n    And no third party access should be permitted without explicit consent\n    And her parenting patterns should not be monetized\n    And the system should protect her from surveillance capitalism\n    And privacy should be default, not opt-in\n    And Sarah's dignity should be protected through data sovereignty\n\n  Scenario: Right to be imperfect parent without shame\n    Given Sarah cannot possibly meet all demands perfectly\n    And parenting culture enforces impossible standards\n    When Sarah makes suboptimal choices under constraint\n    Then the personal_agent should never shame or guilt\n    And it should validate \"You're doing your best with available resources\"\n    And it should recognize that good-enough parenting is actually good\n    And perfectionism should be rejected as harmful\n    And Sarah should be supported in sustainable imperfection\n    And the system should counteract toxic parenting culture\n\n  Scenario: Personal capacity limits respected and enforced\n    Given Sarah has finite energy, time, and emotional capacity\n    And demands regularly exceed her available resources\n    When Sarah approaches capacity limits\n    Then the personal_agent should help her identify what to drop\n    And it should validate saying no to non-essential demands\n    And it should recognize that she cannot do everything\n    And capacity constraints should be treated as real boundaries\n    And the system should support sustainable pacing\n    And Sarah should learn that limitations are human, not failure\n\n  Scenario: Individual skill development beyond parenting role\n    Given Sarah has professional teaching capabilities\n    And she has interests beyond children and household\n    When the personal_agent supports Sarah's development\n    Then it should encourage skill-building in non-parenting domains\n    And it should help her maintain professional identity\n    And it should support her creative interests and intellectual growth\n    And Sarah should have space to develop as complete person\n    And the system should prevent parenting from consuming total identity\n    And individual growth should be valued as essential to sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Recognition that parenting skills are professional-grade capabilities\n    Given Sarah performs developmental psychology, nutritional science, financial management\n    And she coordinates logistics, resolves conflicts, and does long-term strategic planning\n    When the system assesses Sarah's capabilities\n    Then it should recognize parenting as professional-grade work\n    And her skills should be valued as marketable expertise\n    And the system should translate parenting skills to professional context\n    And Sarah should understand she's performing sophisticated labor\n    And her care tokens could translate to professional credit\n    And parenting should be recognized as skilled professional work\n\n  Scenario: Personal values preservation despite intense care demands\n    Given Sarah has core values beyond efficient caregiving\n    And she wants to raise children aligned with those values\n    When Sarah makes care decisions under pressure\n    Then the personal_agent should help her honor her values\n    And it should flag when expedience conflicts with principles\n    And it should support value-aligned decision making even when harder\n    And Sarah's integrity should be preserved despite overwhelming demands\n    And the system should help her be the parent she wants to be\n    And values should not be sacrificed to mere survival\n",
