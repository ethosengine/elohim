  "content": "Scenario: Planning for crisis response maintaining democratic oversight\n    Given emergencies require rapid coordination\n    And I must balance speed with democratic legitimacy\n    When I establish crisis response protocols\n    Then Community Elohim: helps coordinate response rapidly\n    And I maintain: human judgment for crisis decisions\n    And Constitutional Council: provides oversight even under urgency\n    And emergency powers: have clear limits and sunset provisions\n    And we preserve: democratic accountability during crisis\n    And we plan: for resilience without sacrificing governance principles\n    And we demonstrate: democracy can be both deliberative and responsive\n",
