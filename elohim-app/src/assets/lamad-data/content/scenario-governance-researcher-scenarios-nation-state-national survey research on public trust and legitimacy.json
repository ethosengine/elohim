  "content": "Scenario: National survey research on public trust and legitimacy\n    Given I need to understand population-wide attitudes toward protocol\n    And survey data provides breadth that case studies cannot\n    When I conduct nationally representative survey on protocol governance\n    Then I measure: trust in agents vs trust in traditional institutions\n    And I assess: perceived legitimacy of Constitutional Councils\n    And I explore: what predicts individual support or opposition\n    And I examine: demographic patterns in trust and participation\n    And I track: opinion changes over time as protocol matures\n    And I identify: sources of resistance and paths to broader acceptance\n    And My research informs: public engagement and communication strategies\n",
