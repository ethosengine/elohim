  "content": "Scenario: Municipal level participates in county-state coordination\n    Given Riverside is part of larger county and state systems\n    And protocol must integrate with these layers\n    When I coordinate upward with county and state governance\n    Then I share: Riverside's experience with protocol adoption\n    And I advocate: for policies supporting municipal sovereignty\n    And I provide: evidence about outcomes for policy makers\n    And I resist: regulatory overreach from higher layers\n    And I seek: resources and support from county and state\n    And I maintain: that community adopted protocol voluntarily\n    And I protect: subsidiarity principle in multi-layer governance\n",
