State Education Policy Engagement for Teacher\n  As a teacher in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer\n  I want to inform state education policy with classroom expertise\n  So that state decisions reflect teaching and learning realities\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teacher user is registered in the system\n    And the provincial_state governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Teacher tracks state education legislation affecting classroom\n    Given state legislature is considering education bills\n    And teachers can't track complex legislative processes while teaching\n    When the Observer monitors state education legislation\n    Then teachers receive alerts on bills affecting their work\n    And get plain-language summaries of education policy changes\n    And see projected impact on classroom teaching and learning\n    And access advocacy pathways (testimony, legislator contact, coalition)\n    And state policy becomes visible and actionable for frontline professionals\n\n  Scenario: Teacher coordinates statewide advocacy against testing mandate\n    Given state proposes expanding standardized testing requirements\n    And testing already narrows curriculum and stresses students\n    When teachers coordinate through Observer across districts statewide\n    Then 3,200 teachers sign onto collective advocacy campaign\n    And provide testimony on how testing burdens harm learning\n    And build coalition with parents experiencing test stress\n    And present evidence from states that reduced testing\n    And collective professional voice creates political pressure\n    And state testing policy becomes contested not inevitable\n\n  Scenario: Teacher evaluates state education funding formula\n    Given state funding formula determines district resources\n    And formula appears complex and technical\n    When the Observer analyzes state funding impacts\n    Then teachers see their district gets $8,500 per student\n    And neighboring district gets $12,000 per student from same formula\n    And understand which formula factors create disparities\n    And learn which legislators champion funding equity\n    And coordinate with underfunded districts for reform coalition\n    And education funding becomes teacher advocacy priority\n\n  Scenario: Teacher exposes state curriculum standards implementation gap\n    Given state adopted new curriculum standards three years ago\n    But provided no implementation funding or professional development\n    When teachers document implementation reality through Observer\n    Then statewide data shows 68% of teachers lack standards-aligned materials\n    And 71% received no professional development on new standards\n    And student assessment results reflect implementation failure\n    And teachers coordinate testimony to state education committee\n    And policy implementation accountability emerges from teacher evidence\n\n  Scenario: Teacher advocates for professional development reform\n    Given state mandates professional development hours annually\n    But current PD is generic and unhelpful for actual teaching\n    When teachers provide evidence on PD effectiveness through Observer\n    Then aggregated data shows teachers rate 80% of PD as not useful\n    And teachers propose evidence-based PD reform based on what actually helps\n    And document successful PD models from other states\n    And coordinate with education researchers and reform advocates\n    And state professional development policy respects teacher expertise\n\n  Scenario: Teacher challenges state teacher evaluation mandate\n    Given state law requires evaluation system based on student test scores\n    And teachers know this creates perverse incentives and doesn't improve teaching\n    When teachers organize statewide campaign through Observer\n    Then teachers provide evidence on evaluation system failures\n    And show how it drives teaching to test not student learning\n    And present research on effective teacher evaluation approaches\n    And build parent coalition around learning-centered not test-centered education\n    And state evaluation policy becomes political accountability issue\n\n  Scenario: Teacher connects state policy to classroom impacts\n    Given state cut education budget by $400M this year\n    And politicians claim \"no impact on classroom instruction\"\n    When teachers document actual classroom impacts through Observer\n    Then statewide data shows 1,200 teaching positions eliminated\n    And class sizes increased average 3 students per class\n    And art/music/counseling programs cut in 40% of districts\n    And teachers connect budget abstraction to learning reality\n    And teacher evidence exposes political rhetoric vs classroom truth\n",
