  "content": "Scenario: Advocating for predictable scheduling\n    Given unpredictable scheduling destroys my capacity for care work\n    And I cannot manage household, health, or family needs without schedule stability\n    When I want to advocate for predictable scheduling\n    Then the protocol should help me build the case for schedule predictability\n    And provide evidence of how current scheduling harms my well-being\n    And support me in requesting schedule improvements\n    And connect me with co-workers who share this need\n",
