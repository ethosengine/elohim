  "content": "Scenario: Advocating for protocol sovereignty in international forums\n    Given international organizations discuss AI regulation\n    And some proposals would mandate centralization\n    When I advocate for democratic governance principles\n    Then I argue: governments shouldn't mandate protocol architecture\n    And I promote: community sovereignty as democratic principle\n    And I defend: right of communities to adopt or reject protocol\n    And I present: evidence that protocol sovereignty works\n    And I resist: international regulation enabling authoritarian capture\n    And I build: coalition of democratic nations supporting autonomy\n    And I protect: space for democratic AI governance globally\n",
