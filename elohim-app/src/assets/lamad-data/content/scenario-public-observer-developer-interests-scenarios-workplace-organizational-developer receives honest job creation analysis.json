  "content": "Scenario: Developer receives honest job creation analysis\n    Given a developer claims project will \"create 200 jobs\"\n    And uses job creation to justify public subsidies\n    When the Observer provides independent employment impact analysis\n    Then the developer sees: 180 jobs are temporary construction jobs\n    And only 20 are permanent positions\n    And median permanent job wage is $15/hour in area with $22/hour living wage\n    And honest accounting distinguishes temporary versus permanent employment\n    And job quality matters as much as job quantity\n",
