  "content": "Scenario: Null findings about protocol effects inform honest assessment\n    Given my analysis found protocol didn't improve outcomes in certain domains\n    And publication bias favors positive results\n    When I publish findings showing limitations and failures\n    Then I report: honestly about what doesn't work\n    And I provide: evidence challenging protocol advocates' claims\n    And I maintain: scientific integrity over ideological commitment\n    And I enable: realistic expectations and targeted improvements\n    And I contribute: to honest democratic deliberation about governance alternatives\n    And My credibility comes from: willingness to report unflattering truths\n    And Science serves democracy by: providing reliable knowledge not propaganda\n",
