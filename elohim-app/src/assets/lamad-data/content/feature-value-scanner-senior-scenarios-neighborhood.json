Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Senior\n  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want to contribute to neighborhood care economy and build local social capital\n  So that neighborhood resilience is strengthened and my future aging is supported\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the senior user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret actively participates in neighborhood care economy\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care patterns\n    And Margaret has time and presence that working-age neighbors lack\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood presence and availability as care contribution\n    Given Margaret is present in the neighborhood during working hours\n    And she can respond to neighborhood needs in real-time\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks presence-based care\n    Then Margaret's availability should be recognized as valuable\n    And her ability to receive packages for working neighbors should be tracked\n    And her presence during emergencies should be valued\n    And the care contribution of simply being present should be visible\n    And neighborhood benefits from retiree presence should be quantified\n    And Margaret should understand her availability has real value\n\n  Scenario: Participating in neighborhood mutual aid networks\n    Given Margaret has time, skills, and motivation to help neighbors\n    And she also has needs that neighbors can help with\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates mutual aid\n    Then Margaret should be connected to reciprocal care networks\n    And her contributions (childcare help, elder checking, skills) should be tracked\n    And support she receives (technology help, heavy lifting, transportation) should be tracked\n    And the framing should be mutual aid, not charity in either direction\n    And Margaret both gives and receives in neighborhood care economy\n    And dignity should be preserved through reciprocity framework\n\n  Scenario: Building social capital for future care needs\n    Given Margaret is relatively healthy and capable now\n    And she will need more support as she ages\n    When Margaret makes neighborhood care contributions\n    Then she should be building relationships for her future\n    And social capital should accumulate through current contributions\n    And neighbors should develop sense of connection and reciprocity\n    And Margaret's future care needs will be met by strong relationships\n    And she's investing in the community that will care for her\n    And strategic relationship-building for aging should be supported\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood food cooperative participation on fixed income\n    Given Margaret's $150/week budget could benefit from bulk buying\n    And neighbors face similar budget constraints\n    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies food cooperative opportunities\n    Then Margaret should be connected to bulk buying networks\n    And her participation should reduce her grocery costs\n    And she should contribute her time and organizational skills\n    And the cooperative should reduce individual household scarcity\n    And neighborhood coordination should make fixed incomes stretch further\n    And collective action should create better outcomes than individual effort\n\n  Scenario: Knowing and watching out for neighborhood children\n    Given Margaret is present when children are coming home from school\n    And she has time to notice and care about local kids\n    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates informal child watching\n    Then Margaret's presence should contribute to neighborhood safety\n    And parents should understand seniors provide informal oversight\n    And Margaret's care about local children should be recognized\n    And village-scale child protection should be facilitated\n    And intergenerational neighborhood care should be normalized\n    And working parents should benefit from retiree presence\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces household costs\n    Given Margaret has tools, skills, and time\n    And she has limited budget for purchasing services\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates resource sharing\n    Then Margaret should share tools she owns but neighbors need\n    And she should borrow tools she needs occasionally\n    And skill sharing should reduce need for paid services\n    And neighborhood tool library should benefit all members\n    And Margaret's resources should be accessible to community\n    And she should access neighbors' resources when needed\n\n  Scenario: Senior knowledge of neighborhood history and patterns\n    Given Margaret has lived in the neighborhood for years/decades\n    And she has institutional knowledge about local patterns\n    When neighborhood decisions are being made\n    Then Margaret's knowledge should inform decision-making\n    And her historical perspective should be valued\n    And she should have standing in neighborhood governance\n    And long-term residents' wisdom should shape neighborhood future\n    And Margaret's experience should be treated as valuable resource\n    And neighborhood planning should benefit from senior knowledge\n\n  Scenario: Informal elder checking and support network\n    Given multiple seniors live in the neighborhood\n    And Margaret is in the \"younger\" senior cohort\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates elder support\n    Then Margaret should help check on older neighbors\n    And she should receive checking from younger neighbors\n    And gradual transitions in care needs should be supported\n    And no senior should be isolated or unseen\n    And neighborhood should notice if something is wrong\n    And informal care networks should prevent crisis\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood bulk shopping coordination\n    Given Margaret shops regularly at local stores\n    And bulk buying could reduce costs for multiple households\n    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates shopping\n    Then Margaret should be connected to shopping cooperatives\n    And she could coordinate bulk purchases given her time availability\n    And multiple households should split bulk quantities\n    And Margaret's organizational labor should be recognized\n    And cost savings should benefit all participating households\n    And her time availability should serve neighborhood benefit\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining neighborhood relationships across class differences\n    Given Margaret has limited income but middle-class background\n    And the neighborhood may have economic diversity\n    When the neighborhood_elohim facilitates connections\n    Then Margaret should be connected across economic boundaries\n    And her value should not depend on financial resources\n    And care contributions should create cross-class solidarity\n    And the neighborhood should value all members' contributions\n    And economic diversity should strengthen rather than divide\n    And Margaret's care economy participation should bridge differences\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood emergency response and resilience\n    Given Margaret is often home during the day\n    And she has nursing background and crisis response experience\n    When neighborhood emergencies occur\n    Then Margaret should be part of emergency response network\n    And her skills and availability should be known to neighbors\n    And the neighborhood should be more resilient due to her presence\n    And her contributions to collective safety should be tracked\n    And emergency preparedness should be enhanced by retiree participation\n    And Margaret's professional background should serve neighborhood\n\n  Scenario: Privacy maintained while participating in neighborhood networks\n    Given Margaret's financial situation is sensitive\n    And neighborhood participation requires some visibility\n    When Margaret's data contributes to neighborhood coordination\n    Then her specific circumstances must remain private\n    And only aggregated anonymized data should be shared\n    And she should receive benefits without stigmatizing exposure\n    And dignity should be preserved in all interactions\n    And privacy should be balanced with community participation\n    And the protocol should enable solidarity without surveillance\n",
