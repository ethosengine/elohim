Municipal Board Governance for Board Member\n  As a board member serving on a municipal board in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the municipality governance layer\n  I want independent analysis of land use, housing, and development decisions\n  So that I can balance economic development with community interests and equitable outcomes\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the board_member user is registered in the system\n    And the municipality governance context is active\n    And I am a volunteer serving on planning commission, housing authority, or municipal board\n\n  Scenario: Planning commissioner evaluates large residential development proposal\n    Given developer proposes 500-unit development with affordable housing component\n    And staff recommendation supports approval citing housing needs\n    And developer presentation emphasizes economic benefits and community amenities\n    When the planning commissioner requests Observer independent analysis\n    Then they receive comparison of promised versus delivered benefits from developer's past projects\n    And see affordable housing calculation showing units actually affordable to local residents\n    And access traffic, school, and infrastructure impact analysis\n    And discover developer donated $5000 to commissioner's recent campaign\n    And independent analysis reveals information staff presentation omitted\n\n  Scenario: Housing authority board member evaluates mixed-income development policy\n    Given authority considers policy requiring mixed-income units in new developments\n    And staff presents complex financing and legal considerations\n    And board member wants to make informed decision but has limited affordable housing expertise\n    When the board member uses Observer accessible expertise\n    Then they receive plain-language explanation of mixed-income development models\n    And see examples from peer housing authorities with outcomes data\n    And access key trade-offs between requiring affordability and reducing development\n    And get questions to ask staff about implementation and enforcement\n    And accessible expertise enables informed policy judgment\n\n  Scenario: Planning commissioner discovers voting pattern aligned with developer interests\n    Given commissioner has served for two years making numerous land use decisions\n    And local newspaper questions commissioner's independence\n    And commissioner wants to understand their own voting record\n    When the commissioner uses Observer accountability tracking\n    Then they see their votes on developments categorized by community support levels\n    And discover they voted for 85% of projects opposed by neighborhood associations\n    And find their votes consistently favor developments with higher density than staff recommended\n    And access campaign contribution data showing developer funding sources\n    And accountability transparency helps commissioner reflect on whose interests they serve\n\n  Scenario: Parks board member tracks implementation of playground improvement promises\n    Given board approved contract with playground vendor three years ago\n    And vendor promised high-quality equipment meeting accessibility standards\n    And community members complain about equipment safety and accessibility\n    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking\n    Then they discover equipment doesn't meet accessibility standards promised\n    And see maintenance issues documented across multiple park sites\n    And find vendor's performance worse than contract specifications\n    And access data showing peer municipalities use better vendors\n    And impact tracking reveals vendor failed to deliver promised outcomes\n\n  Scenario: Planning commissioner understands community concerns beyond testimony\n    Given commission considers rezoning to allow commercial development in residential area\n    And supporters include business owners and economic development advocates who testified\n    And only 8 residents attended meeting to oppose\n    When the commissioner seeks community accountability data from Observer\n    Then they see survey data from neighborhood residents showing strong opposition\n    And discover working families couldn't attend evening meeting to testify\n    And access analysis showing traffic and noise impacts on residential area\n    And understand broader community concerns beyond who had time to testify\n    And community accountability helps commissioner serve constituent interests\n\n  Scenario: Housing authority board member evaluates rent increase proposal\n    Given authority staff recommends rent increases to cover operating costs\n    And staff presentation emphasizes authority's fiduciary responsibility and budget needs\n    And tenant advocates testify about hardship but lack supporting data\n    When the board member requests Observer independent analysis\n    Then they receive comparison of authority's costs to peer housing authorities\n    And see tenant income data showing rent burden impacts by increase level\n    And access analysis of cost drivers and alternative budget approaches\n    And discover authority's administrative costs higher than similar authorities\n    And independent analysis reveals trade-offs staff presentation minimized\n\n  Scenario: Planning commissioner detects astroturf campaign supporting development\n    Given commission faces decision on controversial mall redevelopment\n    And receives hundreds of emails and petition signatures supporting project\n    And commission wants to understand if support is authentic community sentiment\n    When the commissioner uses Observer to analyze advocacy campaign\n    Then they discover emails use identical language suggesting coordinated campaign\n    And find petition signatures include many from outside the municipality\n    And see analysis showing campaign funded and organized by developer\n    And access authentic community sentiment data showing more mixed views\n    And capture protection helps commissioner distinguish grassroots from astroturf\n\n  Scenario: Municipal board member prepares for complex zoning ordinance revision\n    Given planning staff proposes comprehensive zoning code update\n    And draft ordinance is 150 pages of technical legal language\n    And board must vote within 30 days after public comment period\n    When the board member uses Observer decision support\n    Then they receive executive summary highlighting key policy changes and impacts\n    And see comparison of proposed code to peer municipalities' approaches\n    And access analysis of who benefits and who is burdened by major changes\n    And get specific questions to ask staff about implementation concerns\n    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment on complex ordinance\n",
