    "conclusion": "Integrating Christian Principles with Humane Technology Design  \nAs we conclude this module on helping people thrive, let's reflect on how we can integrate the design principles of humane technology with our Christian understanding of abundant life in Christ.\n\nProtecting Sacred Attention:  \nIn John 10:27, Jesus says, \"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.\" As Christians, our primary attention should be focused on hearing and following Christ's voice. Technology should support, not hinder, this divine connection. By designing technology that respects attention as a sacred resource, we honor God's call on our lives and protect our ability to discern His will. This aligns with the humane technology principle of protecting attention, recognizing it as fundamental to our agency and thriving.\n\nDesigning for God-Centered Intentionality:  \nProverbs 16:9 reminds us, \"The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps.\" As we design for intentionality, we must recognize that true thriving comes from aligning our intentions with God's purposes. Technology should support users in reflecting on their goals, understanding themselves in light of God's word, and acting with purpose. This approach combines the humane technology principle of designing for intentionality with a Christian understanding of purposeful living.\n\nCultivating Deeply Valuable Experiences in Christ:  \nJesus promises in John 15:11, \"These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.\" The deeply valuable experiences we design for should ultimately lead people towards the fullness of joy found in Christ. While technology can provide stimulating experiences, true thriving comes from experiences that deepen our relationship with God and others, foster spiritual growth, and contribute to God's kingdom. This aligns with the principle of designing for deeply valuable experiences, but with a Christian focus on eternal value.\n\nAs we apply these principles, we must be vigilant about the potential for addiction and false promises of meaning. Just as Paul warns in Colossians 2:8, \"See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ,\" we must ensure our technologies don't captivate users with empty promises of fulfillment apart from Christ.",

The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.\"  \nIn this powerful passage, Jesus presents us with a striking contrast: the abundant life He offers versus the destruction that comes from other sources. As we navigate the complex landscape of modern technology, these words take on new significance.  \nOur digital age presents unprecedented opportunities for connection, creativity, and the spread of the Gospel.

In all that he does, he prospers.\"\n\nBalancing Pleasure, Pain, and Meaning:  \nEcclesiastes 3:1-8 \\- \"For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven...\"  \nRomans 5:3-5 \\- \"...we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope...\"\n\nGratitude, Creativity, and Learning:  \n1 Thessalonians 5:18 \\- \"Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.\"  \nExodus 35:31-32 \\- \"...and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship, to devise artistic designs...\"\n\nAccepting Circumstances and Responding Wisely:  \nPhilippians 4:11-13 \\- \"...I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content... I can do all things through him who strengthens me.\"  \nJames 1:5 \\- \"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.\"\n\nFostering Care, Kindness, and Quality Relationships:  \n1 Corinthians 13:4-7 \\- \"Love is patient and kind... It does not insist on its own way...\"  \nProverbs 17:17 \\- \"A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.\"\n\nMinimizing Regret and Living True to Oneself:  \nGalatians 6:4-5 \\- \"But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.\"  \nMatthew 6:33 \\- \"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\"\n\nConsidering Basic Needs and Capabilities for All:  \nActs 4:32-35 \\- \"Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common...\"  \nProverbs 31:8-9 \\- \"Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.\"\n\nProtecting Attention and Time:  \nEphesians 5:15-16 \\- \"Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil.\"  \nPsalm 90:12 \\- \"So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom.\"\n\nDesigning for Intentionality and Conscious Choices:  \nJoshua 24:15 \\- \"...choose this day whom you will serve...\"  \n1 Corinthians 10:31 \\- \"So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.\"\n\nCreating Deeply Valuable Experiences:  \nColossians 3:23-24 \\- \"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men...\"  \nPhilippians 4:8 \\- \"Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.\"\n\n### Story \n\nThe story of Jesus feeding of the 5000, illustrates many of the principles we're aiming for in technology design, found in all four Gospels (Matthew 14:13-21, Mark 6:30-44, Luke 9:10-17, John 6:1-14). This story encapsulates several key design principles that align with both Christian values and humane technology:\n\nRecognizing and Addressing Real Needs:  \nJesus saw the crowd's hunger and responded to their physical need, not just their spiritual one. This parallels our goal of creating technology that addresses genuine human needs rather than manufacturing artificial desires.  \nStewardship of Resources:  \nJesus used what was available (five loaves and two fish) and transformed it into abundance. This exemplifies efficient use of resources and sustainable design.  \nCommunity and Sharing:  \nThe miracle involved everyone sharing and participating in the distribution. This mirrors our aim to create technology that fosters community and collaboration rather than isolation.  \nIntentionality and Mindfulness:  \nJesus had the crowd sit down in groups, creating order and allowing for a more mindful experience of the meal. This reflects our goal of designing for intentional, focused use rather than mindless consumption.  \nAbundance Without Excess:  \nThere was enough for everyone to be satisfied, but Jesus also instructed that the leftovers be gathered, avoiding waste. This balance of abundance without excess is a key principle for sustainable, ethical technology.  \nHolistic Care:  \nJesus addressed both spiritual and physical needs, demonstrating care for the whole person. Our technology should similarly support holistic well-being, not just isolated aspects of human experience.\n\nChristian Design Principles we're trying to elevate:\n\nServant-Hearted Design: Creating technology that serves human needs rather than exploiting human vulnerabilities.  \nStewardship: Developing sustainable technologies that use resources wisely and minimize harmful environmental impact.  \nCommunity-Centric: Prioritizing features that build and strengthen real-world communities and relationships.  \nSabbath-Honoring: Incorporating rest and disconnection into the design, respecting human limits and the need for renewal.  \nTruth-Promoting: Designing systems that elevate truth and combat misinformation, reflecting God's nature as the source of truth.  \nJustice-Oriented: Creating inclusive technologies that consider the needs of all, especially the marginalized.  \nAttention-Respecting: Treating human attention as sacred, designing to enhance focus rather than fragment it.  \nVirtue-Fostering: Encouraging the development of Christian virtues (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, etc.) through technology use.  \nCreation-Affirming: Leveraging technology to help users engage more deeply with the physical world and God's creation, not escape from it.  \nKingdom-Advancing: Aligning technological innovation with the values and goals of God's Kingdom, seeking to bring more of heaven to earth through our creations.\n\nThese principles, grounded in the story of Jesus feeding the 5000, provide a framework for developing technology that truly helps people thrive in a way that honors God and serves humanity.\n\n### Discussion Question or Activity\n\nReview Activity : EXAMINING FLAWED STORIES  \nTechnology companies often have compelling stories about how their products contribute to human thriving.   \nLook at the following stereotypical stories. In what way are they authentic? In what ways do they mimic thriving in toxic ways?\n\n\u201cWe value creators and want to create a place where they can show off their brilliance, grow their audience, and make real money.\u201d   \n          \\-  Often used by products like TikTok  \n\u200b  \n\u201cWe\u2019re a place for fun, inspiration, and ideas that matter. We show people the most relevant content so that they can enjoy themselves and lead more informed and meaningful lives.\u201d   \n          \u2013 Often used by products like YouTube/Google\u200b\n\n\u201cWe help small business owners find customers who\u2019ll love their products so that their businesses can grow and thrive.\u201d   \n          \u2013 Often used by products like Instagram\u200b\n\nReflect on each of these examples. Note that some definitions of thriving you believe in may be tangled up in those stories.   \nThen consider how a product you\u2019ve worked on or use may seek to help people thrive. Does that product define thriving accurately?\n\nREFLECTION: EXAMINING OUR CHURCH'S MISSION AND PRACTICES\n\nJust as technology companies often have compelling stories about how their products contribute to human thriving, churches also have mission statements or creeds that describe their purpose and values. However, like tech companies, churches may sometimes drift from these ideals or unintentionally mask practices that don't align with their stated mission.  \nActivity:\n\nFind your church's mission statement or creed. If your church doesn't have one, consider the general mission of the Christian church as stated in Matthew 28:19-20 or Acts 1:8.  \nReflect on the following questions:  \na. What does your church's mission statement claim about how it contributes to human thriving or fulfills God's calling?  \nb. In what ways is this mission statement authentically lived out in your church's practices?  \nc. Are there ways in which your church's actual practices might mimic thriving in potentially harmful or misleading ways?  \nConsider the following examples of church mission statements and practices. How might these statements potentially mask practices that don't align with their ideals?\n\nExample 1: \"We exist to reach the lost and make disciples of all nations.\"  \nPotential misalignment: A church that focuses solely on overseas missions while neglecting local community needs.  \nExample 2: \"Our mission is to love God, love others, and serve the world.\"  \nPotential misalignment: A church that emphasizes feel-good experiences in worship but doesn't actively engage in serving the local community or addressing social justice issues.  \nExample 3: \"We are a welcoming community where all can experience God's love.\"  \nPotential misalignment: A church that claims to be welcoming but has unspoken cultural or socioeconomic barriers that make certain groups feel unwelcome or excluded.\n\nReflect on these questions:  \na. How might your church's practices sometimes drift from its stated mission?  \nb. Are there any \"metrics\" your church uses to measure success (e.g., attendance, donations) that might inadvertently lead to practices that don't align with its core mission?  \nc. How can your church better align its practices with its stated mission and with biblical principles of thriving?  \nConsider how technology use in your church might be supporting or hindering the authentic fulfillment of its mission. Are there ways technology is being used that might mimic spiritual growth or community building without actually fostering deep, transformative experiences?\n\nThis activity aims to encourage honest, thoughtful reflection on how our churches, like tech companies, can sometimes drift from their core mission or unintentionally adopt practices that don't truly foster thriving as defined by Christ. By examining these potential misalignments, we can work towards creating church communities and using technologies in ways that genuinely support spiritual growth, authentic community, and Christ-centered thriving.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n Integrating Christian Principles with Humane Technology Design  \nAs we conclude this module on helping people thrive, let's reflect on how we can integrate the design principles of humane technology with our Christian understanding of abundant life in Christ.\n\nProtecting Sacred Attention:  \nIn John 10:27, Jesus says, \"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.\" As Christians, our primary attention should be focused on hearing and following Christ's voice. Technology should support, not hinder, this divine connection. By designing technology that respects attention as a sacred resource, we honor God's call on our lives and protect our ability to discern His will. This aligns with the humane technology principle of protecting attention, recognizing it as fundamental to our agency and thriving.\n\nDesigning for God-Centered Intentionality:  \nProverbs 16:9 reminds us, \"The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps.\" As we design for intentionality, we must recognize that true thriving comes from aligning our intentions with God's purposes. Technology should support users in reflecting on their goals, understanding themselves in light of God's word, and acting with purpose. This approach combines the humane technology principle of designing for intentionality with a Christian understanding of purposeful living.\n\nCultivating Deeply Valuable Experiences in Christ:  \nJesus promises in John 15:11, \"These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.\" The deeply valuable experiences we design for should ultimately lead people towards the fullness of joy found in Christ. While technology can provide stimulating experiences, true thriving comes from experiences that deepen our relationship with God and others, foster spiritual growth, and contribute to God's kingdom. This aligns with the principle of designing for deeply valuable experiences, but with a Christian focus on eternal value.\n\nAs we apply these principles, we must be vigilant about the potential for addiction and false promises of meaning. Just as Paul warns in Colossians 2:8, \"See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ,\" we must ensure our technologies don't captivate users with empty promises of fulfillment apart from Christ.\n\n### Application \n\nFor Individual Christians:\n\nPersonal Lifestyle Audit: Develop a tool for individuals to assess how their daily choices (consumption, housing, transportation, etc.) impact their attention, intentionality, and the quality of their experiences.  \n\"Sacred Attention\" Challenge: Create a 30-day program that guides individuals to reclaim their attention through practices like digital fasting, contemplative prayer, and mindful technology use.  \nDigital Footprint Evaluation: Provide a framework for Christians to critically evaluate their online behavior and digital consumption habits in light of their faith values.  \nEthical Stewardship Course: Develop a course on managing personal finances and resources in ways that prioritize deeply valuable experiences over consumerism.  \nCommunity Impact Assessment: Guide individuals in mapping their sphere of influence and identifying opportunities to foster intentional, meaningful relationships in their neighborhoods and workplaces.\n\nFor Church Leaders and Developers:  \nHolistic Church Audit: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of church activities, assessing how they align with the principles of protecting attention, fostering intentionality, and creating deeply valuable experiences.  \nRedefining Success Metrics: Move away from attendance and giving as primary success indicators. Develop new metrics that measure growth in community relationships, spiritual formation, and local community impact.  \nIntentional Gathering Design: Reimagine church gatherings to prioritize deep, meaningful interactions over passive consumption of religious content.  \nDigital Discipleship Framework: Create guidelines for using digital tools to enhance, not replace, face-to-face discipleship and community building.  \n\"Less is More\" Ministry Model: Develop a church model that emphasizes quality of engagement over quantity of programs, allowing more time and space for reflection and intentional living.  \nNeighborhood Engagement Strategy: Design initiatives that embed the church deeply in local community life, fostering relationships and addressing real needs.  \nIntergenerational Wisdom Exchange: Create programs that facilitate the sharing of life experiences and spiritual insights across generations.  \nCollective Resource Stewardship: Implement systems for shared resources within the church community (e.g., tool libraries, carpooling networks, skill exchanges) to promote simplicity and interdependence.  \nDigital Commons Development: Build a church-specific digital platform that facilitates community coordination, resource sharing, and collective decision-making while respecting attention and fostering intentionality.  \n\"Slow Church\" Movement: Promote a church culture that values depth over speed, quality over quantity, and process over immediate results.\n\nPriorities for Implementation:  \nEducation and Awareness: Prioritize helping individuals and churches understand the impact of technology on attention, intentionality, and the quality of our experiences.  \nEmbodied Practices: Focus on developing habits and rituals that bring abstract principles into concrete, lived experience.  \nSystemic Thinking: Encourage a shift from individual-focused solutions to community-wide transformations.  \nRelationship-Centric Design: Ensure all technological implementations prioritize the strengthening of real-world relationships.  \nSimplicity and Depth: Promote a \"less but better\" approach in both personal life and church programming.  \nLocal Rootedness: Emphasize the church's role in local community flourishing.  \nIntergenerational Integration: Actively work against age segregation in church life and decision-making.  \nContinuous Reflection: Implement regular assessment and reflection practices to ensure ongoing alignment with core principles.  \nCounter-Cultural Witness: Empower the church to model alternative ways of living that prioritize attention, intentionality, and deeply valuable experiences in a distracted world.\n\nThese applications and priorities aim to create a church culture that embodies the principles of protecting attention, fostering intentionality, and creating deeply valuable experiences. They challenge both individuals and churches to critically examine their relationship with technology and to develop practices that support genuine human flourishing in light of Christian values.\n\n### Class Homework\n\nCHT 8: Ready To Act\n\n### Other Media / Go Deeper / Class Maps\n\nHere's a list of communities and movements that approach regenerative practices from a faith perspective, with an emphasis on inclusivity and systemic change:\n\nWild Church Network: A collective of faith communities that meet outside and focus on reconnecting people with nature, emphasizing ecological spirituality and stewardship.  \nParish Collective: Cultivates neighborhood-rooted communities that are inclusive, creative, and committed to the flourishing of their local contexts.  \nNew Monasticism: A movement that seeks to embody Christian community in intentional, inclusive ways, often in marginalized neighborhoods.  \nEco-Congregation: An ecumenical program helping churches make the link between environmental issues and Christian faith, and respond in practical action.  \nCreation Justice Ministries: Represents the creation care and environmental justice policies of major Christian denominations, focusing on systemic change.  \nThe Oikos Institute: A Christian think tank exploring regenerative economics and sustainable development from a theological perspective.  \nThe Transforming Center: Offers resources for church leaders to cultivate spiritual transformation, including practices that foster inclusive community.  \nThe Missional Wisdom Foundation: Experiments with and teaches about alternative forms of Christian community, emphasizing inclusivity and sustainability.  \nThe Catholic Climate Covenant: Addresses climate change from a faith perspective, emphasizing integral ecology and community-based solutions.  \nBartimaeus Cooperative Ministries: Integrates biblical study with ecological and economic literacy, and radical discipleship in local contexts.\n\nThese organizations tend to emphasize:\n\nWhole-community approaches rather than top-down charity models  \nIntegration of ecological concerns with social and spiritual practices  \nReimagining church structures and practices for greater inclusivity and sustainability  \nConnecting faith principles with concrete action for systemic change\n\nThey offer models of how faith communities can embody regenerative practices in inclusive ways, seeing themselves as part of the ecosystem they're trying to heal and transform, rather than as outside saviors.  \nFor the \"Other Media/Go Deeper\" section, you might consider including:\n\nBooks like \"The New Parish\" by Paul Sparks, Tim Soerens, and Dwight J. Friesen  \nDocumentaries about intentional communities or eco-villages  \nPodcasts or talks from leaders in these movements  \nCase studies of specific communities that embody these principles  \nResources from organizations like Strong Towns that connect faith, community, and sustainable development\n\nThis would give participants a range of examples and resources to explore different models of community that prioritize thriving in holistic, systemic ways."
