  "content": "Scenario: Financial planning coordinates household resources across generations\n    Given Robert and Jennifer support children, care for parents, and plan for retirement\n    And they have $95k/year to allocate across competing needs\n    When household_elohim supports financial planning\n    Then it should help them balance generational financial demands\n    And surface tradeoffs: \"Increasing parent care support by $500/month reduces retirement savings\"\n    And provide scenarios for different allocation strategies\n    And help them understand long-term implications of current choices\n    And support transparent decision-making about resource allocation\n    And ensure both partners understand and agree to financial priorities\n    And protect their own financial security while supporting generations\n",
