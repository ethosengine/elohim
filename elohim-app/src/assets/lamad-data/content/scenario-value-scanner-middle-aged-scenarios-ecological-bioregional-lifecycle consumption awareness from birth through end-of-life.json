  "content": "Scenario: Lifecycle consumption awareness from birth through end-of-life\n    Given Robert has observed full lifecycle from grandchildren to aging parents\n    And he recognizes consumption patterns across lifespan\n    And lifecycle awareness can inform sustainable choices\n    When bioregional_elohim supports lifecycle consumption awareness\n    Then it should help Robert understand consumption across full lifecycle\n    And surface how current choices affect future generations' ecological inheritance\n    And recognize: \"Reducing consumption now preserves resources for grandchildren's future\"\n    And connect present choices to long-term bioregional health\n    And support sustainable consumption motivated by intergenerational care\n    And demonstrate that ecological stewardship is care for future generations\n    And build consumption patterns that serve lifecycle sustainability\n",
