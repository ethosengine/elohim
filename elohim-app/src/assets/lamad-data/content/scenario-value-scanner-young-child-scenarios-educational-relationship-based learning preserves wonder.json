  "content": "Scenario: Relationship-based learning preserves wonder\n    Given Tommy needs wonder preservation during learning\n    And relationship is primary for ages 5-7\n    When the personal_agent teaches Tommy about care economy\n    Then teaching should happen through story and relationship\n    And the agent should feel like a caring guide, not a system\n    And learning should be framed as adventures: \"What will make Emma smile?\"\n    And transactional language should never be used\n    And wonder at the world should be preserved, not diminished\n    And the magic of caring should remain intact\n",
