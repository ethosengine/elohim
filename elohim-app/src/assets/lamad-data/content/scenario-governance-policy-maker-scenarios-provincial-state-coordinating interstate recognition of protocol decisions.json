  "content": "Scenario: Coordinating interstate recognition of protocol decisions\n    Given protocol operates across state boundaries\n    And consistency is needed for coordination\n    When I work on interstate compact for protocol recognition\n    Then we establish: mutual recognition of council decisions across states\n    And we create: conflict resolution mechanisms for disputes\n    And we maintain: state sovereignty and variation\n    And we enable: coordination without centralization\n    And we show: federalism working for AI governance\n    And states cooperate: while preserving local autonomy\n",
