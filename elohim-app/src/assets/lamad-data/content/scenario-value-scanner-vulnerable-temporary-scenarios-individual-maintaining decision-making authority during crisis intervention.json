  "content": "Scenario: Maintaining decision-making authority during crisis intervention\n    Given I am experiencing a housing crisis\n    And multiple support agencies want to \"help\" me\n    When I express my preferences for how I want to resolve the situation\n    Then the Value Scanner supports MY chosen path\n    And does not override my decisions with institutional preferences\n    And tracks my decision-making as evidence of my capability\n    And connects me to resources that respect my autonomy\n    And my personal_agent advocates for my choices in institutional contexts\n    And the system recognizes that I am the expert on my own life\n    And support is offered as scaffolding, not control\n    And my agency is preserved even while I'm receiving assistance\n",
