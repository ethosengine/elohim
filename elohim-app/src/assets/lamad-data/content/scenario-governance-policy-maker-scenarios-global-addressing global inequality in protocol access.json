  "content": "Scenario: Addressing global inequality in protocol access\n    Given research shows protocol adoption correlates with national wealth\n    And poor nations lack infrastructure for implementation\n    When I advocate for global equity in access\n    Then I promote: international funding mechanisms\n    And I support: technology transfer without strings attached\n    And I push: for open source hardware and software\n    And I challenge: intellectual property barriers to adoption\n    And I ensure: protocol doesn't exacerbate global inequality\n    And I work: for democratic AI governance as universal right\n    And I recognize: justice requires addressing structural barriers\n",
