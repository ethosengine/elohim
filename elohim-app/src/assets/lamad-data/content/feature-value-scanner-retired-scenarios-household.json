Household Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person\n  As a retired person managing a household\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want equitable care labor distribution and coordinated aging planning\n  So that both partners maintain dignity and partnership through retirement and aging\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the retired user \"Frank\" is registered in the system\n    And Frank shares a household with his wife\n    And they live on combined fixed income of $28k/year\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And the household_elohim is coordinating household care economy\n    And both partners are retired and managing aging together\n\n  Scenario: Making both partners' retirement care contributions visible\n    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity\n    And his wife contributes different care labor to family and community\n    And both provide substantial unpaid care work\n    When the household_elohim tracks contributions\n    Then both partners' care work should be quantified specifically\n    And volunteer labor, family care, and community participation should be valued\n    And invisible labor imbalances should become visible\n    And both Frank and his wife should see who's doing what\n    And data should support equitable distribution conversations\n    And both partners' contributions should be recognized and celebrated\n\n  Scenario: Household budget management on fixed retirement income\n    Given household operates on $28k/year fixed income\n    And income cannot be increased through employment\n    And resources must cover housing, food, healthcare, and participation\n    When Frank and his wife make household financial decisions\n    Then the household_elohim should track spending against fixed budget\n    And it should identify optimization opportunities without stigma\n    And it should integrate financial constraints with care contribution goals\n    And it should help both partners make informed trade-offs\n    And budget should reflect care priorities and community participation\n    And financial management should maintain dignity and agency\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating household care labor in retirement\n    Given Frank and his wife both have time freedom from employment\n    And household labor needs to be distributed equitably\n    And traditional gender patterns may persist despite retirement\n    When the household_elohim monitors labor distribution\n    Then it should track household tasks performed by each partner\n    And it should identify unfair distributions early\n    And it should surface imbalances: \"Frank's wife handles 75% of meal preparation\"\n    And both partners should receive prompts about equity\n    And adjustments should be negotiated from data, not resentment\n    And retirement should enable more equitable household partnerships\n\n  Scenario: Planning for aging together with dignity and agency\n    Given Frank and his wife are both aging\n    And their capabilities and care needs will change over time\n    And they're committed to supporting each other\n    When the household_elohim supports aging planning\n    Then it should help them plan for increasing care needs together\n    And it should facilitate conversations about future care scenarios\n    And it should coordinate with family about eventual support needs\n    And it should help them maintain autonomy as long as possible\n    And planning should preserve both partners' dignity and agency\n    And they should experience aging as partners, not burdens to each other\n\n  Scenario: Household care tokens reflect combined retirement contributions\n    Given household participates in care token economy\n    And both partners contribute substantial volunteer and family care\n    When household care tokens are calculated\n    Then tokens should accumulate from both partners' contributions\n    And Frank's Habitat work should be valued appropriately\n    And his wife's care contributions should be recognized\n    And household should receive care token supplements for low fixed income\n    And the scanner should be accessible regardless of economic status\n    And combined contributions should create household care economy resources\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating household participation across multiple contexts\n    Given Frank volunteers with Habitat and serves on council\n    And his wife has her own community participation\n    And both provide family care across generations\n    When the household_elohim coordinates participation\n    Then it should integrate both partners' schedules and commitments\n    And it should prevent household overcommitment\n    And it should ensure both partners have rest and personal time\n    And it should support diverse participation that serves flourishing\n    And coordination should enable rather than constrain engagement\n    And household should function as base for community contribution\n\n  Scenario: Managing healthcare costs and coordination for two aging partners\n    Given Frank and his wife both have aging-related healthcare needs\n    And healthcare costs are significant on fixed income\n    And medication management becomes more complex with age\n    When the household_elohim coordinates healthcare\n    Then it should track both partners' medical appointments and needs\n    And it should help manage medication schedules and interactions\n    And it should coordinate healthcare spending with household budget\n    And it should support both partners in advocating for each other\n    And healthcare navigation should be simplified and supported\n    And household should maintain health within economic constraints\n\n  Scenario: Household governance decisions made as equal partners\n    Given Frank and his wife are equal partners in household\n    And both contribute care labor and have voice in decisions\n    When household decisions are made\n    Then the household_elohim should support collaborative decision-making\n    And neither partner should dominate household governance\n    And both partners' preferences and needs should have equal weight\n    And retirement should enable true partnership, not hierarchy\n    And household decisions should serve both partners' flourishing\n    And equitable partnership should be structurally supported\n\n  Scenario: Household privacy protected from external surveillance\n    Given household care economy generates detailed living pattern data\n    And this data reveals intimate household dynamics\n    When household data is collected\n    Then it must remain under household members' control\n    And no external entities should access household data without consent\n    And community organizations should only see what's shared\n    And family should respect household privacy boundaries\n    And healthcare providers should only access consented information\n    And household privacy should be absolutely protected\n\n  Scenario: Supporting each other through health challenges\n    Given one or both partners may face health crises\n    And partners provide mutual care and support\n    When the household_elohim tracks caregiving between partners\n    Then it should recognize care provided by each partner\n    And it should surface when care burden becomes unsustainable\n    And it should suggest external support when needed\n    And care between partners should be valued and visible\n    And the system should protect relationship health under care stress\n    And mutual care should strengthen rather than strain partnership\n\n  Scenario: Household food security maintained on fixed budget\n    Given household has $140/week grocery budget for two people\n    And nutritional needs change with age for both partners\n    When the household_elohim supports food planning\n    Then it should help maintain nutrition within budget constraints\n    And it should coordinate meal planning for both partners' dietary needs\n    And it should reduce food waste to maximize budget efficiency\n    And it should connect household to community food resources without stigma\n    And food security should be maintained with dignity\n    And household should not face nutrition inadequacy\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining household independence and self-sufficiency\n    Given Frank and his wife value their independence\n    And they want to age in place as long as possible\n    When the household_elohim supports independence\n    Then it should help household maintain self-sufficiency\n    And it should optimize resources for maximum autonomy\n    And it should coordinate with family without creating dependence\n    And it should surface when external support is truly needed\n    And household should experience agency and dignity in aging\n    And independence should be supported as long as safe and sustainable\n",
