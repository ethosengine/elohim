  "content": "Scenario: Accessible neighborhood events enable Alex's participation\n    Given neighborhood events are often inaccessible\n    And inaccessibility equals exclusion from community\n    When neighborhood events are planned\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should prompt organizers about accessibility\n    And it should provide checklist of access considerations\n    And Alex should be consulted as accessibility expert\n    And venues should be verified for wheelchair access, sensory accommodations\n    And accessible events should become neighborhood norm\n    And Alex should be able to participate fully in neighborhood life\n    And inclusion should be proactive, not reactive\n",
