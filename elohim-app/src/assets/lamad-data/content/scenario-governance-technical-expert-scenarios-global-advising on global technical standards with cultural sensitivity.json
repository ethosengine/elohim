  "content": "Scenario: Advising on global technical standards with cultural sensitivity\n    Given global protocol needs technical standards\n    And different cultures have different technical capacities\n    When I help develop culturally-sensitive technical requirements\n    Then I ensure: standards work with varying infrastructure\n    And I avoid: assuming Global North technical context\n    And I support: diverse implementation approaches\n    And I enable: low-resource communities to participate\n    And I collaborate: with Global South technical experts\n    And I resist: digital colonialism in technical design\n    And I demonstrate: that technical standards can honor diversity\n",
