National Governance for Researcher\n  As a researcher in the governance system\n  Operating at the national governance layer\n  I want to conduct longitudinal research on democratic AI governance\n  So that long-term effects and transformations are rigorously documented\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational across the entire nation\n    And Dr. James Chen is conducting 10-year longitudinal study\n    And the national governance context is active\n    And James has secured multi-year funding from National Science Foundation\n    And research follows cohorts of communities, councils, and individuals over time\n\n  Scenario: Establish 10-year longitudinal study tracking protocol evolution\n    Given James begins study in 2025 when protocol is newly adopted\n    And he wants to understand long-term transformation effects\n    When James designs the longitudinal research\n    Then he selects cohort of 50 diverse communities to track\n    And he recruits sample of Constitutional Council members to follow\n    And he establishes baseline measurements before protocol adoption\n    And he plans annual follow-up measurements for 10 years\n    And he commits to capturing both positive and negative long-term effects\n\n  Scenario: Track how Riverside community evolves over 10 years\n    Given Riverside adopted protocol in Year 1 of study\n    When James returns annually to measure changes\n    Then he tracks wellbeing indicators over full decade\n    And he documents how trust builds incrementally not instantaneously\n    And he observes how civic participation increases over time\n    And he identifies challenges that emerge only after years of operation\n    And he captures transformation that short-term studies miss\n    And longitudinal design reveals cumulative effects\n\n  Scenario: Follow Sarah Martinez's democratic development after council service\n    Given Sarah served on Constitutional Council in Year 3\n    When James interviews Sarah annually for 7 years\n    Then he documents immediate effects on her constitutional literacy\n    And he tracks how she participates differently in community afterward\n    And he observes her selection for regional council in Year 5\n    And he examines her participation in Global Convention in Year 7\n    And he captures how sortition governance transforms citizens over time\n    And individual trajectory illustrates broader pattern\n\n  Scenario: Study whether children growing up with protocol develop different capacities\n    Given Tommy was 12 when Riverside adopted protocol\n    And James tracks cohort of adolescents through development\n    When James compares protocol-exposed youth to control group\n    Then he measures civic engagement, constitutional literacy, and deliberative skills\n    And he finds protocol-exposed youth have stronger democratic capacities\n    And he documents different relationship to AI than parents' generation\n    And he examines whether effects persist into young adulthood\n    And generational analysis reveals transformative potential\n\n  Scenario: Analyze whether initial wellbeing gains sustain or decay\n    Given early studies showed 8% life satisfaction improvement\n    And question is whether gains persist long-term\n    When James examines 10-year trajectory\n    Then he finds initial gains sustain through Year 5\n    And he observes additional gains accumulating in Years 6-10\n    And he discovers trust compounds over time\n    And he identifies that sustained benefit requires continued democratic participation\n    And longitudinal perspective distinguishes honeymoon effects from stable transformation\n\n  Scenario: Document how national Constitutional Council precedents evolve\n    Given James has access to decade of council decisions\n    When he analyzes constitutional interpretation evolution\n    Then he tracks how privacy threshold precedents changed over time\n    And he examines what drives constitutional evolution (new cases, research, social change)\n    And he identifies increasing sophistication in council reasoning\n    And he documents how precedent database becomes institutional wisdom\n    And constitutional evolution is captured empirically\n\n  Scenario: Study systematic bias correction over time\n    Given Year 2 research identified bias affecting marginalized communities\n    And protocol modifications were implemented in Year 3\n    When James tracks bias indicators through Year 10\n    Then he measures whether modifications successfully reduced bias\n    And he documents improved outcomes for marginalized communities\n    And he identifies remaining persistent inequalities\n    And he evaluates effectiveness of bias correction mechanisms\n    And longitudinal accountability serves justice\n\n  Scenario: Provide evidence to Senator Ruiz for federal policy continuation\n    Given Elena needs evidence that federal funding produces lasting benefits\n    When James presents 10-year findings to Senate Committee\n    Then he shows sustained wellbeing improvements across decade\n    And he demonstrates democratic capacity building persists\n    And he documents cost-effectiveness over long-term horizon\n    And he provides honest assessment of challenges and failures\n    And his rigorous longitudinal research justifies continued federal investment\n\n  Scenario: Examine cohort effects comparing early vs late adopters\n    Given communities adopted protocol at different times across decade\n    When James compares adoption cohorts\n    Then he finds early adopters benefit from learning community support\n    And he discovers later adopters benefit from improved protocol versions\n    And he identifies that community context matters more than timing\n    And cohort analysis illuminates adoption dynamics\n\n  Scenario: Investigate whether protocol governance quality degrades as it scales\n    Given protocol expanded from dozens to thousands of communities\n    When James examines governance quality metrics over scale\n    Then he tracks Constitutional Council deliberation quality\n    And he measures appeal resolution fairness over time\n    And he examines whether coordination complexity overwhelms benefits\n    And he finds quality generally sustains but identifies scaling challenges\n    And research informs protocol architecture improvements\n\n  Scenario: Study long-term effects on mental health and social cohesion\n    Given protocol aims to reduce loneliness and improve wellbeing\n    When James analyzes decade of mental health and cohesion data\n    Then he finds sustained reduction in loneliness indicators\n    And he documents improved community social networks\n    And he examines whether benefits distribute equitably\n    And he identifies mental health improvements particularly strong for isolated individuals\n    And long-term health effects justify protocol as public health intervention\n\n  Scenario: Publish comprehensive 10-year findings in major journal\n    Given James has completed decade-long study\n    When he prepares comprehensive research report\n    Then he documents methodology with full transparency\n    And he presents both positive findings and disappointments\n    And he acknowledges uncertainties and limitations\n    And he makes full dataset available for replication\n    And he publishes open access in multiple formats\n    And he contributes definitive evidence about democratic AI governance at scale\n",
