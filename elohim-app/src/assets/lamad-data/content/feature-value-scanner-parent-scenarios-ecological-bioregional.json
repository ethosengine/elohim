Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Parent\n  As a parent preparing children to care for ecological systems\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want to teach environmental stewardship as care economy practice\n  So that the next generation understands care extends to living systems\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the parent user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah is teaching Tommy (5) and Emma (8) environmental values\n    And Sarah wants children to understand ecological care as essential\n    And the ecological governance context is active\n    And the ecological_elohim could coordinate bioregional care economy\n    And Sarah is raising children who will inherit climate crisis\n\n  Scenario: Teaching children that environmental care is care work\n    Given Sarah wants Tommy and Emma to understand ecological stewardship\n    And she's teaching them care economy principles\n    When Sarah teaches environmental practices\n    Then the ecological_elohim should recognize this as value literacy education\n    And teaching ecological care should accumulate care tokens\n    And children should learn that caring for environment is care work\n    And the system should value environmental education as parenting labor\n    And next generation should internalize ecological care as fundamental\n    And Sarah's environmental teaching should be recognized and valued\n\n  Scenario: Family consumption patterns aligned with ecological values\n    Given Sarah manages household purchasing decisions\n    And she wants to minimize environmental harm\n    When the Value Scanner tracks family consumption\n    Then it should provide ecological impact information\n    And it should help Sarah make environmentally responsible choices\n    And it should recognize trade-offs between budget and sustainability\n    And the system should support ecological decision-making\n    And family care economy should include environmental care\n    And Sarah's work to reduce harm should be valued\n\n  Scenario: Waste reduction as household care contribution\n    Given Sarah manages household waste and recycling\n    And reducing waste requires planning and effort\n    When the ecological_elohim tracks waste reduction work\n    Then it should recognize waste management as care labor\n    And it should value Sarah's composting, recycling, waste minimization\n    And it should quantify environmental benefit of her work\n    And waste reduction should accumulate care tokens\n    And the system should make invisible ecological labor visible\n    And Sarah's environmental care work should be recognized\n\n  Scenario: Teaching children ecological responsibility through food choices\n    Given Sarah manages family food system\n    And food has enormous environmental impact\n    When Sarah teaches Tommy and Emma about food ecology\n    Then the educational_elohim should recognize ecological education\n    And teaching about local food, seasonal eating, food waste should be valued\n    And Sarah's work to build children's food literacy should accumulate tokens\n    And the system should recognize ecological food education as care work\n    And next generation should learn food as ecological relationship\n    And Sarah's teaching should be valued as environmental stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional connection through local food and resources\n    Given Sarah's family lives in specific bioregion\n    And connecting to local ecology builds stewardship\n    When the ecological_elohim supports bioregional connection\n    Then it should help Sarah source local food and resources\n    And it should provide information about regional ecology\n    And it should recognize Sarah's work to build local connections\n    And bioregional care should be valued in care economy\n    And the system should support regional ecological engagement\n    And Sarah should be rewarded for choosing local over global\n\n  Scenario: Climate anxiety and ecological grief with children\n    Given children are aware of environmental crisis\n    And Tommy and Emma may experience climate anxiety\n    When Sarah supports children's ecological emotions\n    Then the personal_agent should recognize this as emotional care work\n    And it should help Sarah process her own climate grief\n    And it should provide resources for talking with children about climate\n    And supporting children's environmental feelings should be valued\n    And the system should recognize emotional dimension of ecological parenting\n    And Sarah's work navigating climate crisis with children should be supported\n\n  Scenario: Environmental education through direct nature connection\n    Given children need connection to living world\n    And Sarah takes Tommy and Emma to parks, forests, waterways\n    When the ecological_elohim tracks nature-based education\n    Then it should recognize outdoor time as valuable educational labor\n    And it should value Sarah's work facilitating nature connection\n    And teaching through direct ecological experience should accumulate tokens\n    And the system should recognize that nature connection is parenting work\n    And environmental education should be valued alongside academic learning\n    And Sarah's effort to build children's nature relationship should be recognized\n\n  Scenario: Household energy and resource use optimization\n    Given Sarah manages household energy and resource consumption\n    And reducing usage requires conscious effort and planning\n    When the ecological_elohim tracks resource management\n    Then it should recognize Sarah's work to minimize consumption\n    And it should value conservation as care labor\n    And it should quantify environmental benefit of reduced usage\n    And resource management should accumulate care tokens\n    And the system should recognize ecological household management\n    And Sarah's environmental care work should be visible and valued\n\n  Scenario: Teaching children repair, reuse, and circular economy\n    Given children learn consumption patterns from parents\n    And Sarah wants to teach alternatives to disposable culture\n    When Sarah teaches Tommy and Emma to repair and reuse\n    Then the educational_elohim should recognize anti-consumerist education\n    And teaching circular economy practices should accumulate care tokens\n    And Sarah's work to counter disposable culture should be valued\n    And the system should recognize teaching sustainable practices\n    And next generation should learn to value durability and repair\n    And Sarah's cultural transmission work should be recognized\n\n  Scenario: Community environmental projects and collective action\n    Given ecological challenges require collective response\n    And Sarah participates in community environmental initiatives\n    When the ecological_elohim tracks Sarah's environmental activism\n    Then it should recognize organizing as ecological care work\n    And it should value her participation in community environmental projects\n    And activism labor should accumulate care tokens\n    And the system should support parent environmental advocacy\n    And Sarah's work to build sustainable community should be recognized\n    And collective ecological action should be valued as care contribution\n\n  Scenario: Intergenerational ecological responsibility and future generations\n    Given Sarah is raising children who will face climate consequences\n    And current generation's choices affect future generations\n    When the ecological_elohim assesses intergenerational care\n    Then it should recognize Sarah's work preparing children for climate future\n    And it should value her teaching of environmental responsibility\n    And raising environmentally conscious children should be recognized as service to future\n    And the system should honor intergenerational ecological care\n    And Sarah's parenting should be valued as investment in planetary future\n    And care for future generations should be fundamental care economy principle\n\n  Scenario: Garden and food production as ecological care and education\n    Given Sarah wants children to understand food systems\n    And growing food teaches ecological relationships\n    When Sarah gardens with Tommy and Emma\n    Then the ecological_elohim should recognize gardening as multi-dimensional care\n    And it should value food production, education, and ecological benefit\n    And teaching children to grow food should accumulate care tokens\n    And the system should recognize food sovereignty work\n    And Sarah's effort to build children's food system understanding should be valued\n    And gardening should be recognized as ecological care
