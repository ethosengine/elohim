Municipal-Level Governance Coordination for Community Leader\n  As a community_leader in the governance system\n  Operating at the municipal governance layer\n  I want to coordinate protocol across neighborhoods within the city\n  So that different areas can collaborate while respecting local differences\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the community_leader user is registered in the system\n    And the municipality governance context is active\n    And Mayor Jamal coordinates across Riverside's diverse neighborhoods\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating across neighborhoods with different needs\n    Given Riverside has neighborhoods with different priorities\n    And downtown needs economic development\n    And residential areas prioritize environmental protection\n    And outskirts need infrastructure investment\n    When I facilitate municipal coordination\n    Then Municipal Elohim: helps identify resource flows and conflicts\n    And city council: deliberates on balancing neighborhood needs\n    And we ensure: each neighborhood has voice in decisions\n    And we negotiate: resource allocation serving whole city\n    And protocol enables: coordination without centralization\n    And neighborhoods retain: autonomy within municipal framework\n    And I facilitate: democratic negotiation across differences\n\n  Scenario: Municipal Elohim provides cross-neighborhood insights\n    Given different neighborhoods have distinct challenges\n    And patterns aren't visible at single-neighborhood scale\n    When Municipal Elohim synthesizes cross-neighborhood data\n    Then I see: resource flows between neighborhoods\n    And I identify: opportunities for coordination\n    And I notice: problems emerging in multiple areas\n    And I recognize: how neighborhoods affect each other\n    And I use: this information for city council decisions\n    And I maintain: human judgment over agent information\n    And agent enhances: my understanding without replacing leadership\n\n  Scenario: Resolving conflict between neighborhood protocol calibrations\n    Given different Riverside neighborhoods calibrated privacy differently\n    And this creates friction when residents move between areas\n    When I facilitate resolution of calibration conflicts\n    Then we convene: representatives from affected neighborhoods\n    And we deliberate: on whether harmonization is needed\n    And we consider: if diversity should be preserved or reduced\n    And we respect: neighborhood sovereignty within city context\n    And we find: pragmatic accommodation of differences\n    And we demonstrate: subsidiarity working across scales\n    And democratic negotiation: resolves conflicts algorithm cannot\n\n  Scenario: Municipal Constitutional Council handles city-level appeals\n    Given some appeals affect multiple neighborhoods or city as whole\n    And community-layer councils referred case to municipal level\n    When Municipal Constitutional Council reviews the appeal\n    Then I provide: city-wide context for their deliberation\n    And they evaluate: if decision aligns with city's constitutional interpretation\n    And they consider: effects across all Riverside neighborhoods\n    And they create: municipal-level precedent\n    And they may recommend: city council policy action\n    And I implement: their recommendations respecting their authority\n    And municipal governance: maintains democratic accountability\n\n  Scenario: Integrating municipal services with protocol coordination\n    Given city provides services (water, waste, transit, parks)\n    And these need coordination with protocol resource flows\n    When I integrate municipal services with Elohim coordination\n    Then city departments: share data with agents appropriately\n    And Municipal Elohim: helps optimize service delivery\n    And environmental services: coordinate with Ecosystem Elohim\n    And social services: work with Community Elohim for crisis response\n    And integration respects: department professional judgment\n    And agents augment: not replace city workers\n    And public services improve: through better coordination\n\n  Scenario: Municipal budget allocation informed by protocol data\n    Given city council determines annual budget\n    And we need evidence about neighborhood needs and priorities\n    When Municipal Elohim provides resource flow analysis\n    Then we see: which neighborhoods are underserved\n    And we identify: where investments would have most impact\n    And we understand: how different spending choices ripple across city\n    And city council: deliberates and decides using this information\n    And we maintain: political accountability for budget choices\n    And protocol transparency: enables better democratic decision-making\n    And agent information: serves elected governance\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating economic development across municipality\n    Given Riverside needs economic revitalization\n    And different neighborhoods have different economic needs\n    When I coordinate city-wide economic development strategy\n    Then Municipal Elohim: analyzes economic flows and opportunities\n    And we identify: where business support like Maria's loan needed most\n    And we coordinate: workforce development with neighborhood needs\n    And we ensure: economic growth benefits whole city not just wealthy areas\n    And we integrate: protocol support with traditional economic development\n    And we maintain: accountability to residents for economic choices\n    And coordination strengthens: inclusive economic resilience\n\n  Scenario: Municipal planning commission uses agent constitutional analysis\n    Given planning commission reviews development proposals\n    And developments affect multiple neighborhoods and city environment\n    When Municipal Elohim provides constitutional analysis\n    Then agent flags: if development would harm watershed\n    And agent assesses: effects on housing affordability, traffic, equity\n    And agent provides: constitutional principles analysis\n    And planning commission: still makes final decision\n    And commissioners: use information but maintain judgment authority\n    And development review: incorporates constitutional considerations\n    And city planning: serves broader values beyond narrow economics\n\n  Scenario: Managing municipal-level crisis affecting whole city\n    Given city-wide emergency (flood, economic shock, public health crisis)\n    And coordination across neighborhoods is critical\n    When I coordinate municipal crisis response\n    Then Municipal Elohim: helps identify needs and match resources rapidly\n    And we enable: mutual aid flows across neighborhoods\n    And we coordinate: with county and state for additional support\n    And I maintain: human judgment on crisis priorities\n    And Municipal Constitutional Council: provides oversight even in emergency\n    And we preserve: democratic accountability under pressure\n    And protocol enhances: crisis response without sacrificing governance\n\n  Scenario: Cross-municipal coordination with neighboring cities\n    Given some challenges extend beyond Riverside boundaries\n    And watershed management affects multiple municipalities\n    When I coordinate with neighboring community leaders\n    Then we convene: inter-municipal deliberative assemblies\n    And agents from: different municipalities share analysis\n    And we negotiate: agreements serving all communities\n    And we respect: each municipality's sovereignty\n    And we find: synthesis through democratic deliberation\n    And lateral coordination: addresses problems that don't respect boundaries\n    And we demonstrate: governance working across jurisdictions\n\n  Scenario: Municipal transparency dashboard for public accountability\n    Given residents deserve visibility into city governance\n    And I am accountable through democratic elections\n    When we provide municipal transparency dashboard\n    Then residents see: resource flows across neighborhoods\n    And they access: appeal patterns and council decisions\n    And they view: city budget allocation and outcomes\n    And they compare: promised benefits with actual results\n    And they hold me accountable: with evidence not just rhetoric\n    And transparency strengthens: democratic governance\n    And I cannot hide: behind \"algorithm decided\" or \"trust me\"\n\n  Scenario: Municipal level participates in county-state coordination\n    Given Riverside is part of larger county and state systems\n    And protocol must integrate with these layers\n    When I coordinate upward with county and state governance\n    Then I share: Riverside's experience with protocol adoption\n    And I advocate: for policies supporting municipal sovereignty\n    And I provide: evidence about outcomes for policy makers\n    And I resist: regulatory overreach from higher layers\n    And I seek: resources and support from county and state\n    And I maintain: that community adopted protocol voluntarily\n    And I protect: subsidiarity principle in multi-layer governance\n\n  Scenario: Training city staff to work alongside protocol agents\n    Given city employees need to understand protocol to do their jobs\n    And they may feel threatened by AI systems\n    When I coordinate staff training and cultural adaptation\n    Then we explain: how protocol augments not replaces their work\n    And we provide: training on working with agent information\n    And we clarify: that professional judgment remains valued\n    And we ensure: staff see agents as tools not replacements\n    And we maintain: good jobs with dignity for city workers\n    And we demonstrate: that democratic AI can strengthen not undermine labor\n    And implementation respects: people doing the work\n\n  Scenario: Municipal governance evolution through protocol learning\n    Given Riverside has three years implementing protocol\n    And we have learned what works and what doesn't\n    When I reflect on governance transformation\n    Then I see: city council making better-informed decisions\n    And I notice: residents more engaged through transparency\n    And I observe: faster crisis response with better coordination\n    And I acknowledge: challenges with accessibility and occasional controversy\n    And I understand: protocol enhanced but didn't replace democratic governance\n    And I know: community remains in control through sovereignty and calibration\n    And I have become: leader facilitating partnership with AI not commanding it\n",
