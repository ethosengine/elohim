  "content": "Feature: Individual Autonomy and Agency During Temporary Vulnerability\n  As a person experiencing temporary vulnerability\n  I want to maintain individual autonomy and decision-making authority\n  So that I can rebuild my life according to my values while receiving dignified support\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am navigating temporary vulnerability\n    And I am using the Value Scanner to coordinate crisis support\n    And my personal_agent is active and supporting me\n    And my care contributions are being tracked and recognized\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining decision-making authority during crisis intervention\n    Given I am experiencing a housing crisis\n    And multiple support agencies want to \"help\" me\n    When I express my preferences for how I want to resolve the situation\n    Then the Value Scanner supports MY chosen path\n    And does not override my decisions with institutional preferences\n    And tracks my decision-making as evidence of my capability\n    And connects me to resources that respect my autonomy\n    And my personal_agent advocates for my choices in institutional contexts\n    And the system recognizes that I am the expert on my own life\n    And support is offered as scaffolding, not control\n    And my agency is preserved even while I'm receiving assistance\n\n  Scenario: Tracking personal goals and progress during crisis recovery\n    Given I am rebuilding my life after leaving an abusive relationship\n    And I have set personal goals for stability and independence\n    When I make progress toward my goals (even small steps)\n    Then the Value Scanner celebrates my achievements\n    And tracks my progress without imposing external timelines\n    And helps me identify next steps at my pace\n    And recognizes setbacks as normal parts of recovery\n    And maintains my focus on my vision for my future\n    And counters institutional pressure to recover \"faster\" or \"properly\"\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of how far I've come\n    And validates that my timeline is the right timeline\n\n  Scenario: Managing privacy and information sharing on my terms\n    Given I have sensitive information about my situation\n    And multiple institutions are requesting access to my data\n    When I decide what to share and with whom\n    Then the Value Scanner gives me granular control over all data sharing\n    And defaults to maximum privacy protection\n    And clearly explains consequences of sharing vs. not sharing\n    And never shares information without my explicit consent\n    And helps me understand my rights regarding privacy\n    And protects me from institutional coercion to over-share\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to privacy risks\n    And my safety-critical information remains absolutely protected\n\n  Scenario: Accessing crisis resources without losing dignity\n    Given I need immediate assistance with food and housing\n    And I am worried about stigma and degradation\n    When I access support through the care economy network\n    Then resources are provided based on my care contributions, not means-testing\n    And I am treated as a community member deserving support\n    And there is no requirement to prove I'm \"needy enough\"\n    And I don't have to expose private trauma to gatekeepers\n    And assistance is framed as reciprocal care, not charity\n    And the system recognizes my parenting labor as valuable contribution\n    And my dignity is preserved throughout the support process\n    And I maintain my standing as a person, not a \"case\"\n\n  Scenario: Exercising financial autonomy despite constrained resources\n    Given I am managing an extremely limited budget\n    And I have temporary assistance and unreliable child support\n    When I make spending decisions for my household\n    Then the Value Scanner supports MY financial choices\n    And does not impose external judgments about \"proper\" spending\n    And helps me track and optimize within my constraints\n    And recognizes that I understand my children's needs\n    And provides decision support without taking over decisions\n    And validates that my resource management under crisis is sophisticated work\n    And my personal_agent suggests options without prescribing choices\n    And my financial sovereignty is respected\n\n  Scenario: Setting boundaries with institutions and service providers\n    Given I am navigating multiple social service systems\n    And some institutional demands feel invasive or harmful\n    When I identify a boundary I need to maintain\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me understand my rights\n    And provides language for asserting my boundaries\n    And tracks instances where institutions violate my boundaries\n    And connects me to advocacy support when needed\n    And validates that boundary-setting is healthy and appropriate\n    And my personal_agent coaches me through difficult conversations\n    And recognizes that protecting my wellbeing is my right\n    And supports me in saying \"no\" when necessary\n\n  Scenario: Rebuilding self-concept after trauma and loss\n    Given my sense of self has been damaged by abuse and crisis\n    And I struggle with self-blame and internalized stigma\n    When I engage with the Value Scanner over time\n    Then the system consistently reflects my worth and capability\n    And makes visible my substantial care contributions\n    And celebrates my strengths and achievements\n    And reframes \"survival\" as sophisticated, valuable work\n    And counters stigmatizing narratives about people in crisis\n    And my personal_agent provides affirming, non-judgmental support\n    And the care economy recognizes me as valuable community member\n    And I see evidence of my competence and contributions\n\n  Scenario: Making major life decisions under extreme stress\n    Given I need to make important decisions about housing, employment, or children's needs\n    And I am traumatized, exhausted, and overwhelmed\n    When I need to evaluate my options\n    Then my personal_agent helps me process complex information\n    And breaks down overwhelming decisions into manageable steps\n    And provides decision support without making decisions for me\n    And helps me identify my priorities and values\n    And surfaces relevant information at the right time\n    And prevents decision paralysis without overriding my agency\n    And validates that my stress is reasonable given my circumstances\n    And trusts that I can make good decisions with appropriate support\n\n  Scenario: Asserting parenting authority despite institutional scrutiny\n    Given institutions are monitoring my parenting during crisis\n    And I fear judgment or intervention\n    When I make parenting decisions based on my knowledge of my children\n    Then the Value Scanner validates my parental authority\n    And documents my sophisticated parenting labor\n    And helps me articulate my parenting reasoning to institutions\n    And recognizes that I am the expert on my children's needs\n    And supports me in resisting inappropriate institutional interference\n    And my personal_agent helps me present my parenting capability effectively\n    And the care token system makes visible my substantial parenting contributions\n    And my parenting is recognized as valuable work, not scrutinized as potential failure\n\n  Scenario: Choosing my own timeline for crisis recovery\n    Given well-meaning people have expectations about how quickly I should \"move on\"\n    And I am recovering at my own pace\n    When external pressure conflicts with my needs\n    Then the Value Scanner supports my chosen timeline\n    And validates that recovery is not linear\n    And helps me resist pressure to rush or perform recovery\n    And tracks my progress according to my goals, not external standards\n    And recognizes that trauma recovery takes time\n    And my personal_agent reminds me that my pace is appropriate\n    And celebrates progress without imposing arbitrary milestones\n    And supports my right to heal in my own way\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining identity beyond crisis circumstances\n    Given I am defined by institutions as \"domestic violence survivor\" or \"homeless person\"\n    And I am much more than my current circumstances\n    When I interact with the Value Scanner\n    Then the system recognizes my full humanity and complexity\n    And documents my interests, skills, values, and dreams\n    And reflects back my identity beyond crisis labels\n    And helps me pursue aspects of life that matter to me\n    And validates that crisis is something I'm experiencing, not who I am\n    And my personal_agent knows and responds to my whole self\n    And the care economy values me as complete person\n    And my identity is not reduced to my vulnerability\n\n  Scenario: Exercising the right to change my mind and try different approaches\n    Given I am trying various strategies for rebuilding stability\n    And some approaches work better than others\n    When I decide to change direction or try something new\n    Then the Value Scanner supports my experimentation without judgment\n    And does not penalize me for changing course\n    And helps me learn from what didn't work\n    And validates that finding the right path takes trial and error\n    And institutional partners respect my right to redirect\n    And my personal_agent helps me evaluate different approaches\n    And tracks what I've learned, not just what \"failed\"\n    And my agency to pivot is preserved and supported\n",
