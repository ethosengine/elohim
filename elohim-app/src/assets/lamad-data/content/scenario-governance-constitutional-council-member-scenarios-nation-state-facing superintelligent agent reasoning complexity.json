  "content": "Scenario: Facing superintelligent agent reasoning complexity\n    Given an appeal involves agent reasoning approaching comprehension limits\n    And I struggle to understand what I'm judging\n    When we confront superintelligence governance question\n    Then we honestly acknowledge: limits of our understanding\n    And we hear: technical experts explain what can and cannot be grasped\n    And we evaluate: if cryptographic proof suffices when reasoning is opaque\n    And we grapple: with governing intelligence that exceeds ours\n    And we may establish: capability limits until explainability improves\n    And we preserve: democratic oversight even at AI capability frontiers\n    And we accept: uncertainty about whether this is truly possible\n",
