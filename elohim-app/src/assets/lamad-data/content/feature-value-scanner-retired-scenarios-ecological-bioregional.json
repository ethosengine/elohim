Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person\n  As a retired person in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want my construction knowledge applied to sustainable building and resource conservation valued\n  So that retirement enables ecological stewardship and my skills serve bioregional flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the retired user \"Frank\" is registered in the system\n    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction\n    And Frank volunteers with Habitat for Humanity\n    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active\n    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates ecological care practices\n    And Frank's construction knowledge can serve sustainable building\n\n  Scenario: Sustainable building practices in Habitat construction work\n    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week in construction\n    And building practices have significant environmental impact\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks Frank's construction work\n    Then it should recognize opportunities for sustainable building techniques\n    And suggest energy-efficient construction methods\n    And facilitate use of recycled or sustainable materials\n    And help Frank apply his skills to ecological building\n    And quantify environmental benefit of sustainable construction choices\n    And recognize that his labor can serve both housing and ecological goals\n    And Habitat work should model sustainable building practices\n\n  Scenario: Construction knowledge applied to home energy efficiency improvements\n    Given Frank has expertise in building systems and repairs\n    And home energy efficiency reduces environmental impact and costs\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates weatherization and efficiency\n    Then it should connect Frank's skills to home efficiency improvements\n    And facilitate community weatherization projects\n    And recognize efficiency work as ecological care contribution\n    And help low-income households reduce energy costs and consumption\n    And Frank's construction knowledge should serve ecological and equity goals\n    And his volunteer work should build community energy resilience\n\n  Scenario: Teaching repair and maintenance reduces waste and consumption\n    Given Frank knows how to repair buildings, equipment, and systems\n    And repair culture counters disposability and resource extraction\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates repair knowledge sharing\n    Then it should facilitate Frank teaching repair skills\n    And help community members learn to maintain their homes\n    And recognize repair education as ecological care contribution\n    And reduce consumption through extended equipment lifespan\n    And build bioregional self-sufficiency through skill transmission\n    And Frank's knowledge should serve waste reduction and resilience\n\n  Scenario: Frugality and resource conservation aligned with ecological sustainability\n    Given Frank lives on fixed income requiring careful resource management\n    And resource conservation serves both budget and ecological goals\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks resource use\n    Then it should recognize Frank's frugality as ecological practice\n    And resource optimization should be framed as stewardship, not just scarcity\n    And his careful consumption should be valued as ecological wisdom\n    And practices like reducing waste and buying quality should be celebrated\n    And economic constraint should be understood as ecological virtue\n    And Frank's lifestyle should model sustainable consumption\n\n  Scenario: Buying quality tools and materials that last reduces resource extraction\n    Given Frank learned to invest in quality tools and materials\n    And durability reduces waste and manufacturing impact\n    When Frank makes purchasing decisions\n    Then his personal_agent should support quality-over-quantity choices\n    And the bioregional_elohim should track durability practices\n    And buying quality should be recognized as ecological stewardship\n    And Frank's knowledge of durability should inform others\n    And throwaway culture should be countered by his construction wisdom\n    And consumption patterns should favor longevity and repairability\n\n  Scenario: Local material sourcing reduces transportation impact\n    Given Frank's construction work requires materials\n    And material transportation has significant carbon footprint\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates material sourcing\n    Then it should facilitate use of locally-sourced materials\n    And connect Frank to local salvage and reclaimed material sources\n    And reduce transportation impact through bioregional supply chains\n    And recognize local sourcing as ecological care contribution\n    And strengthen bioregional material economies\n    And Frank's work should demonstrate local material viability\n\n  Scenario: Construction waste reduction and material reuse\n    Given construction generates substantial waste\n    And Frank has knowledge of material reuse and salvage\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks construction waste\n    Then it should help Frank minimize waste in Habitat projects\n    And facilitate salvaging and reusing materials\n    And recognize waste reduction as ecological care contribution\n    And teach construction waste minimization to others\n    And quantify environmental benefit of material reuse\n    And Frank's expertise should reduce construction environmental impact\n\n  Scenario: Water conservation in construction and household practices\n    Given water is critical bioregional resource\n    And Frank's construction knowledge includes plumbing systems\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates water stewardship\n    Then it should facilitate water-efficient plumbing in Habitat work\n    And help Frank repair leaks and improve water systems in community\n    And track water conservation as ecological care contribution\n    And teach water conservation practices to community\n    And Frank's skills should serve bioregional water security\n    And his expertise should build water-wise infrastructure\n\n  Scenario: Passive solar and natural ventilation in building design\n    Given Frank has construction experience with building orientation and design\n    And passive solar and ventilation reduce energy consumption\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates sustainable building\n    Then it should facilitate passive design elements in Habitat projects\n    And help Frank apply climate-appropriate building techniques\n    And recognize building design knowledge as ecological expertise\n    And quantify energy savings from passive design choices\n    And teach sustainable design principles to younger builders\n    And Frank's knowledge should serve low-energy building practices\n\n  Scenario: Elder knowledge of historical building techniques and materials\n    Given Frank has decades of construction experience\n    And traditional building techniques are often more sustainable\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates building knowledge\n    Then it should value Frank's knowledge of traditional techniques\n    And facilitate teaching historical building methods\n    And recognize that older practices may be more ecological\n    And connect past building wisdom to contemporary sustainability\n    And Frank's experience should inform bioregional building culture\n    And elder knowledge should guide sustainable building revival\n\n  Scenario: Tool sharing and maintenance reduces consumption and waste\n    Given Frank has accumulated quality tools over decades\n    And tool sharing reduces unnecessary consumption\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates tool libraries\n    Then it should facilitate Frank sharing tools with community\n    And help him teach tool maintenance and care\n    And recognize tool sharing as ecological and community contribution\n    And reduce tool consumption through shared resources\n    And Frank's tool knowledge should serve community self-sufficiency\n    And his participation should model sharing economy practices\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional construction material knowledge and sourcing\n    Given Frank knows regional building materials and their properties\n    And bioregional materials reduce transportation and support local economy\n    When the bioregional_elohim coordinates material knowledge\n    Then it should help Frank teach about regional construction materials\n    And facilitate use of bioregionally-appropriate building techniques\n    And recognize his knowledge of local material properties\n    And strengthen bioregional building culture and economy\n    And connect construction practices to place-based sustainability\n    And Frank's experience should inform bioregional building standards\n",
