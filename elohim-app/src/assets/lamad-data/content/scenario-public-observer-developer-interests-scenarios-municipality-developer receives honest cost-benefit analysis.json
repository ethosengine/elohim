  "content": "Scenario: Developer receives honest cost-benefit analysis\n    Given a developer projects $5M annual tax revenue from proposed development\n    But omits infrastructure costs and school capacity burden\n    When the Observer provides independent analysis\n    Then the developer sees: net tax impact only $800K after infrastructure costs\n    And school enrollment increase requires $2M capacity expansion\n    And traffic impacts need $1.5M intersection improvements\n    And honest accounting reveals actual community trade-offs\n    And realistic projections inform better civic decisions\n",
