Family Layer Value Recognition for Teen\n  As a teen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want to participate as a junior partner moving toward equality in family governance\n  So that my substantial care contributions are recognized and I learn how families function as economic units\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teen user \"Jasmine\" is registered in the system\n    And Jasmine is 16 years old\n    And she is part of a family unit with parent Maya and sibling Jordan (age 12)\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim is coordinating family care economy\n    And Jasmine's personal_agent communicates with family_elohim\n\n  Scenario: Teen's substantial care work made visible to family\n    Given Jasmine manages weekly grocery shopping for the family\n    And she coordinates dinner preparation 3 nights per week\n    And she provides childcare for Jordan after school\n    When the family_elohim processes her contributions\n    Then Jasmine's care work should be visible on the family dashboard\n    And her contributions should be quantified and valued\n    And parent Maya should see specific recognition prompts\n    And family care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions\n    And the visibility should prevent the invisibility that often surrounds teen household labor\n    And Jasmine should experience being valued as a genuine contributor\n\n  Scenario: Teen participates in family governance decisions with real voice\n    Given the family is making decisions about a major purchase (new appliance)\n    And Jasmine has accumulated significant care contributions\n    And she has relevant knowledge and preferences\n    When the family_elohim facilitates the decision process\n    Then Jasmine's voice should carry weight in the decision\n    And her input should be solicited and genuinely considered\n    And she should participate as a junior partner, not just be consulted\n    And the family should make decisions that reflect all members' input\n    And Jasmine should learn that her participation in family governance is legitimate\n    And the decision process should prepare her for adult household management\n\n  Scenario: Teen manages portions of household budget with real responsibility\n    Given Jasmine has been allocated responsibility for weekly food budget\n    And the family has allocated $100/week for her to manage\n    And this is part of the actual household budget, not pretend\n    When Jasmine makes purchasing decisions\n    Then she should have genuine authority over those funds\n    And her decisions should have real impact on family wellbeing\n    And the family_elohim should track her budget management\n    And provide feedback on value optimization\n    And recognize successful management: \"Jasmine has stayed within budget and met family needs for 12 consecutive weeks\"\n    And support her learning household economics through real practice\n\n  Scenario: Relationship with parent shifts toward adult partnership\n    Given Jasmine has demonstrated substantial capability\n    And she contributes meaningfully to household functioning\n    When parent Maya interacts with Jasmine through the care economy\n    Then the family_elohim should reflect their evolving relationship\n    And Maya should receive prompts that honor Jasmine's growing autonomy\n    And support Maya in trusting Jasmine's judgment\n    And recognize when Jasmine needs support versus when she's capable\n    And facilitate the gradual transition from parent-child to adult-adult relationship\n    And help Maya learn to be available for support without controlling\n\n  Scenario: Teen coordinates her schedule with family needs\n    Given Jasmine works part-time with variable hours\n    And the family has commitments that require coordination\n    And Jordan needs after-school supervision\n    When Jasmine's work schedule is set\n    Then her personal_agent should communicate with family_elohim\n    And flag potential conflicts: \"Jordan needs supervision Tuesday 3-6pm\"\n    And help Jasmine balance her work commitments with family responsibilities\n    And recognize her care contributions when she adjusts her schedule for family\n    And support the family in coordinating across multiple schedules\n    And demonstrate that family functioning requires mutual care and flexibility\n\n  Scenario: Family care tokens acknowledge teen's economic contribution\n    Given the family participates in care token economy\n    And Jasmine contributes substantial household labor, childcare, and coordination\n    When family care tokens are calculated\n    Then Jasmine's contributions should be valued appropriately\n    And her care work should be recognized as genuine economic contribution\n    And tokens should accumulate to her individual account within the family system\n    And she should have voice in how family care tokens are used\n    And her standing in family economic decisions should reflect her contribution\n    And the token system should make visible what traditional economics renders invisible\n\n  Scenario: Teen provides sibling care as valued family contribution\n    Given Jasmine provides regular after-school care for Jordan\n    And this care enables parent Maya to work full-time\n    And Jasmine's care work has substantial economic value\n    When Jasmine's sibling care is tracked\n    Then it should be valued as the labor it is, not dismissed as \"just babysitting\"\n    And the care should be recognized in family care token allocation\n    And Maya should receive prompts to explicitly acknowledge this contribution\n    And Jordan should learn to recognize Jasmine's care work\n    And the family should understand that Jasmine's care enables their current lifestyle\n    And if external childcare would cost $15/hour, Jasmine's care should be valued accordingly\n\n  Scenario: Teen participates in family financial planning\n    Given the family is planning for the coming year\n    And Jasmine has savings goals for college\n    And she contributes to household income through her part-time work\n    When the family_elohim facilitates financial planning\n    Then Jasmine should be included in the planning process\n    And her goals should be incorporated into family financial strategy\n    And she should learn how families make long-term financial decisions\n    And her contributions (both household labor and income) should be factored into planning\n    And she should practice the financial planning skills she'll need as an adult\n    And the family should model transparent, participatory financial governance\n\n  Scenario: Privacy boundaries negotiated as teen develops autonomy\n    Given Jasmine has legitimate need for privacy from family\n    And the family has legitimate need for coordination and safety\n    When Jasmine configures privacy settings\n    Then she should control what family data is shared about her\n    And family-relevant information (schedule, household responsibilities) should be accessible to family_elohim\n    And her personal information (friendships, private purchases, reflections) should be protected\n    And privacy boundaries should be negotiable as she demonstrates capability\n    And the system should support healthy family relationships that respect growing autonomy\n    And Maya should not experience anxiety about granting Jasmine appropriate privacy\n\n  Scenario: Teen's care contributions prevent exploitation within family\n    Given Jasmine contributes substantial household labor\n    And there is risk of teen labor being exploited even within families\n    When Jasmine's care contributions exceed healthy boundaries\n    Then the family_elohim should flag potential exploitation\n    And surface if Jasmine's responsibilities are preventing her development\n    And recognize if she's providing excessive childcare or household labor\n    And prompt family discussion about fair distribution of care work\n    And protect Jasmine from being trapped in unpaid household labor\n    And ensure her contributions are recognized and not taken for granted\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns family economic realities through transparency\n    Given Jasmine is preparing for adult independence\n    And understanding family economics is essential preparation\n    When the family_elohim provides family economic information\n    Then Jasmine should have age-appropriate access to family financial realities\n    And understand household income, expenses, and budget constraints\n    And learn how the family makes financial tradeoffs\n    And develop realistic expectations about adult economic life\n    And understand the economic value of household labor\n    And learn that all families engage in care economy, whether they use that language or not\n\n  Scenario: Multigenerational family care patterns include teen as contributor\n    Given Jasmine's grandmother requires increasing care support\n    And the family is coordinating care across generations\n    When Jasmine contributes to grandmother's care\n    Then her care work should be tracked and valued\n    And the family_elohim should coordinate care across three generations\n    And Jasmine should learn that care flows in multiple directions\n    And her care for grandmother should build toward her understanding of lifecycle care\n    And the family should model care economy across the full lifespan\n    And Jasmine's generation should learn that elder care is shared family responsibility\n",
