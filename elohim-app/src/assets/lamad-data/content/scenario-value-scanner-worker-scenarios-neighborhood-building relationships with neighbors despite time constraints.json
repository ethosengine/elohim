  "content": "Scenario: Building relationships with neighbors despite time constraints\n    Given neighborhood resilience depends on connection between residents\n    And my work schedule limits social time\n    When I have brief moments available\n    Then the protocol should help me build neighbor relationships\n    And suggest low-time ways to connect and contribute\n    And recognize that presence and greeting count as care\n    And support neighborhood social fabric even with limited participation\n",
