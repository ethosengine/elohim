  "content": "Scenario: Watershed protection becomes shared bioregional responsibility\n    Given agricultural runoff affects water quality throughout watershed\n    And individual farms lack resources or incentives to protect water comprehensively\n    When bioregional democratic network coordinates watershed stewardship\n    Then farms across watershed implement water protection practices (buffer strips, reduced chemicals)\n    And water quality monitoring shows improvement from coordinated stewardship\n    And downstream communities benefit from agricultural water protection\n    And watershed health becomes collective responsibility with visible benefits\n    And bioregional_elohim monitors watershed health and coordinates protection efforts\n",
