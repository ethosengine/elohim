  "content": "Scenario: Rebuilding household material stability after losing everything\n    Given I left my previous household with minimal possessions\n    And I am rebuilding household from nearly nothing\n    When I work to acquire essential household items\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me prioritize what household needs most urgently\n    And connects me to resources for furniture, household goods, children's items\n    And tracks what I have and what I still need\n    And helps me access assistance without stigma\n    And coordinates donations and support from community networks\n    And my personal_agent surfaces opportunities for needed items\n    And recognizes household rebuilding as substantial productive labor\n    And celebrates each step toward material stability\n",
