  "content": "Scenario: Responsible developer leverages positive track record\n    Given a responsible developer delivered promised benefits in three past projects\n    And competes against extractive developer with misleading claims\n    When the Observer makes track records visible\n    Then the responsible developer's history shows: jobs delivered matched projections\n    And community benefits were actually built and maintained\n    And environmental commitments were kept\n    And positive reputation becomes competitive advantage\n    And integrity creates market differentiation\n",
