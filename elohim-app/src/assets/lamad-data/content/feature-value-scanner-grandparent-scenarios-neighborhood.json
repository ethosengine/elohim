Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Grandparent\n  As a retired grandparent with time and presence in the neighborhood\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want my contributions to neighborhood care economy to be visible\n  So that neighborhood resilience is strengthened by elder engagement\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the grandparent user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret lives in a residential neighborhood\n    And Margaret is retired and has daytime presence in neighborhood\n    And Margaret often cares for grandchildren in neighborhood context\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy\n\n  Scenario: Retired grandparent presence strengthens neighborhood resilience\n    Given Margaret is home during weekdays when many neighbors work\n    And her presence provides neighborhood stability and observation\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks resident engagement\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's daytime presence as valuable\n    And it should value retired residents' neighborhood stewardship\n    And it should recognize she provides informal neighborhood watch\n    And her availability strengthens neighborhood safety and connection\n    And retired elders should be seen as neighborhood assets\n    And presence and engagement should accumulate care tokens\n    And neighborhood benefits from Margaret's availability\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating informal grandchild care sharing with neighbors\n    Given Margaret cares for her grandchildren regularly\n    And other neighborhood grandparents also provide childcare\n    When Margaret coordinates with other grandparents\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate care coordination\n    And it should help grandparents share resources and support\n    And it should enable mutual aid among neighborhood grandparents\n    And grandparents should form care networks for collective benefit\n    And neighborhood care economy should strengthen through elder collaboration\n    And Margaret should connect with other grandparents in similar roles\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood knowledge and connection from long residence\n    Given Margaret has lived in neighborhood for many years\n    And she knows neighborhood history, patterns, and relationships\n    When the neighborhood_elohim recognizes resident knowledge\n    Then it should value Margaret's accumulated neighborhood wisdom\n    And it should recognize long-term residents as knowledge keepers\n    And her connections should be seen as neighborhood social capital\n    And institutional memory should be valued and utilized\n    And Margaret's knowledge should inform neighborhood decisions\n    And elder residents should be recognized as neighborhood resources\n\n  Scenario: Creating intergenerational connections in neighborhood\n    Given Margaret engages with neighbors of all ages\n    And she bridges generational divides through relationships\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks social connections\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's role in intergenerational connection\n    And it should value her relationships with children, parents, and elders\n    And she should help create all-ages neighborhood culture\n    And intergenerational mixing should strengthen neighborhood resilience\n    And Margaret's social bridging should be recognized as care work\n    And neighborhood should benefit from cross-generational relationships\n\n  Scenario: Informal neighborhood care and mutual aid provision\n    Given Margaret helps neighbors with various small needs\n    And she receives help from neighbors when needed\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks mutual aid\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's care contributions to neighbors\n    And it should track reciprocal neighborhood support\n    And small acts of care should accumulate as care tokens\n    And neighborhood care economy should be visible and valued\n    And mutual aid should strengthen neighborhood bonds\n    And Margaret should build neighborhood care relationships\n\n  Scenario: Safety and well-being observation for neighborhood children\n    Given Margaret is often outside with grandchildren\n    And she observes neighborhood children's activities and safety\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks child safety contributions\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's informal supervision\n    And it should value her care for neighborhood children's well-being\n    And her presence should contribute to collective childcare\n    And neighborhood children should benefit from elder attention\n    And Margaret's observation should be recognized as care work\n    And neighborhood should be safer because of engaged elders\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood walking and outdoor activity with grandchildren\n    Given Margaret takes grandchildren on neighborhood walks\n    And they visit parks, library, neighbors, and local businesses\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks local engagement\n    Then it should recognize this as neighborhood participation\n    And it should value intergenerational use of neighborhood spaces\n    And it should show Margaret teaching grandchildren about their community\n    And walking should build neighborhood social connections\n    And local business patronage should support neighborhood economy\n    And Margaret's activities should strengthen neighborhood vitality\n\n  Scenario: Sharing traditional skills and knowledge with neighbors\n    Given Margaret has skills from her generation (cooking, gardening, crafts)\n    And neighbors might benefit from this knowledge\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks knowledge sharing\n    Then it should recognize Margaret's teaching as care work\n    And it should facilitate skill-sharing opportunities\n    And it should connect Margaret with neighbors wanting to learn\n    And traditional knowledge should be valued and transmitted\n    And neighborhood should benefit from elder skills and wisdom\n    And Margaret's teaching should accumulate care tokens\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating with neighborhood parents around children's activities\n    Given Margaret cares for grandchildren in neighborhood context\n    And she interacts with other children and parents\n    When Margaret participates in neighborhood child activities\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should help coordinate with other parents\n    And it should facilitate communication about children's play and safety\n    And it should support collective neighborhood childcare\n    And Margaret should be recognized as part of neighborhood care network\n    And grandparents should be valued participants in children's community\n    And neighborhood should benefit from grandparent engagement\n\n  Scenario: Building care relationships that will support Margaret's aging\n    Given Margaret is building neighborhood relationships now\n    And she will need neighborhood support as she ages\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks care relationship development\n    Then it should recognize Margaret is building care economy capital\n    And her current contributions should create future reciprocity\n    And neighbors she helps now will help her later\n    And neighborhood care networks should support aging in place\n    And Margaret's care work should enable her own aging in community\n    And neighborhood relationships should provide long-term security\n\n  Scenario: Seasonal and weather-related neighborhood mutual aid\n    Given Margaret is often available during daytime\n    And neighborhood needs vary with seasons and weather\n    When the neighborhood coordinates seasonal care\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate seasonal mutual aid\n    And Margaret might help with snow observation, mail collection, or storm preparation\n    And she should receive help with physical tasks she cannot do\n    And seasonal care should be reciprocal and community-building\n    And neighborhood resilience should increase through elder participation\n    And Margaret should contribute according to her capacity\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood representation and voice for retirees\n    Given Margaret has time to attend neighborhood meetings\n    And retired residents have important perspective and needs\n    When neighborhood governance decisions are made\n    Then Margaret's participation and voice should be valued\n    And retired residents' interests should be represented\n    And her care contributions should give her standing in decisions\n    And neighborhood should benefit from elder wisdom and participation\n    And Margaret should help shape neighborhood policies and priorities\n    And all age groups should be represented in neighborhood governance\n",
