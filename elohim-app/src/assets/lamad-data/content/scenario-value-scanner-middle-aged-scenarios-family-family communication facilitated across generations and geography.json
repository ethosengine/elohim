  "content": "Scenario: Family communication facilitated across generations and geography\n    Given family members are distributed across states\n    And communication about care needs is essential but complex\n    And family discussions about care can be emotionally difficult\n    When family_elohim supports family communication\n    Then it should provide structured communication tools\n    And facilitate difficult conversations about elder care, finances, and support\n    And ensure all relevant family members have voice\n    And help family navigate emotional complexity of care discussions\n    And support family in making collaborative decisions\n    And prevent communication breakdowns that harm care coordination\n    And maintain family cohesion amid care demands\n",
