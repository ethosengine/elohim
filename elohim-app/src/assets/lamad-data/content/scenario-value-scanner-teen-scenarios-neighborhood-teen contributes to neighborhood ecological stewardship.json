  "content": "Scenario: Teen contributes to neighborhood ecological stewardship\n    Given Jasmine's neighborhood has collective garden spaces\n    And environmental stewardship is part of neighborhood care economy\n    When Jasmine contributes to neighborhood composting or garden maintenance\n    Then her ecological care work should be tracked and valued\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize environmental labor\n    And she should learn that care extends to land and ecological systems\n    And neighborhood food production should be understood as collective care work\n    And her generation should develop expectation that communities steward their environment\n    And ecological care should be integrated with social and economic care\n",
