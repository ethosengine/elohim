  "content": "Scenario: Presenting competing technical interpretations to council\n    Given technical experts disagree about transparency method adequacy\n    And council needs to understand the disagreement\n    When I present both my view and Dr. Chen's alternative\n    Then I explain: his argument fairly and completely\n    And I articulate: where we agree and where we differ\n    And I present: his evidence alongside mine\n    And I avoid: dismissing his perspective unfairly\n    And I let: council judge which interpretation is more constitutionally aligned\n    And I demonstrate: intellectual humility and respect for disagreement\n    And council sees: that expertise involves uncertainty\n",
