Workplace Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver\n  As a caregiver navigating employment while providing intensive care\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want workplace systems that recognize and accommodate caregiving realities\n  So that caregivers can maintain employment without choosing between work and care\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the caregiver user \"James\" is registered in the system\n    And James works part-time (~20 hours/week) as IT contractor\n    And James provides intensive care for David with early-onset Alzheimer's\n    And caregiving severely limits James's work capacity\n    And the workplace governance context is active\n    And the workplace_elohim advocates for caregiver needs\n    And James's employment is precarious due to caregiving demands\n\n  Scenario: Workplace recognition of caregiver constraints on employment\n    Given James can only work ~20 hours/week due to caregiving\n    And his availability is constrained by care needs\n    When the workplace_elohim communicates with employers\n    Then James's caregiving situation should be visible to employer\n    And his reduced availability should be explained as care-related\n    And employer should understand caregiving constraints on capacity\n    And caregiver status should be recognized as legitimate limit\n    And workplace should accommodate caregiving realities\n\n  Scenario: Flexible scheduling enables caregiving and employment simultaneously\n    Given James's caregiving demands vary unpredictably\n    And rigid schedules would make employment impossible\n    When James negotiates work arrangements\n    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for flexibility\n    And scheduling should accommodate caregiving emergencies\n    And James should be able to work around care demands\n    And flexibility should be policy, not just employer goodwill\n    And workplace should recognize caregivers need scheduling flexibility\n\n  Scenario: Remote work essential for caregiver employment viability\n    Given James cannot leave David alone for commuting and full workdays\n    And remote work makes part-time employment possible\n    When employment arrangements are structured\n    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for remote work access\n    And remote work should be recognized as caregiving accommodation\n    And employers should understand caregivers depend on remote options\n    And workplace should support remote work for caregiving employees\n    And location flexibility should be caregiving accessibility issue\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver leave policies protect employment during crises\n    Given caregiving crises occur unpredictably\n    And James may need to take sudden leave for David's care\n    When the workplace_elohim advocates for leave policies\n    Then caregiver leave should be available like parental leave\n    And leave should be protected employment, not termination risk\n    And James should access leave without penalty\n    And workplace should recognize adult care like child care\n    And caregiver leave should be employment protection\n\n  Scenario: Part-time employment with full benefits for caregivers\n    Given James can only work part-time due to caregiving\n    And loss of benefits creates devastating vulnerability\n    When the workplace_elohim advocates for benefits policy\n    Then part-time caregiver employees should access benefits\n    And healthcare coverage should not require full-time employment\n    And benefits should recognize caregiving as legitimate constraint\n    And workplace should not force caregivers to choose between care and benefits\n    And employment protection should include part-time caregivers\n\n  Scenario: Workplace understanding prevents caregiver discrimination\n    Given caregivers often face employment discrimination\n    And James might be seen as less committed or reliable\n    When the workplace_elohim monitors for discrimination\n    Then it should recognize caregiver discrimination patterns\n    And it should educate employers about caregiver rights\n    And it should advocate when James faces unfair treatment\n    And workplace should not penalize caregiving responsibilities\n    And caregiver status should be protected like other statuses\n\n  Scenario: Career trajectory protection despite reduced hours\n    Given James's career has been derailed by caregiving\n    And years of part-time work affects future employment\n    When the workplace_elohim tracks career impact\n    Then caregiving years should be recognized as valuable experience\n    And James's skills should be valued despite reduced hours\n    And career gaps should be explained as caregiving, not lack of ambition\n    And future employers should understand caregiver career patterns\n    And workplace should not permanently penalize caregiving years\n\n  Scenario: Income replacement through care economy when employment impossible\n    Given James's income dropped from $80k to $40k due to caregiving\n    And he may eventually be unable to work at all\n    When employment becomes impossible\n    Then the workplace_elohim should document care work value\n    And care token accumulation should provide income replacement\n    And care economy should recognize professional-grade family care\n    And James should have economic support if employment ends\n    And care contributions should provide economic standing\n\n  Scenario: Employer education about caregiver employee realities\n    Given employers often don't understand caregiver demands\n    And ignorance leads to policies that exclude caregivers\n    When the workplace_elohim advocates for caregiver employees\n    Then it should educate employers about caregiving intensity\n    And it should demonstrate caregivers are valuable employees\n    And it should show accommodation benefits retention\n    And employers should understand caregiving as widespread need\n    And workplace culture should become caregiver-friendly\n\n  Scenario: Professional development access despite caregiving constraints\n    Given James wants to maintain professional skills\n    And caregiving prevents traditional professional development\n    When professional development is offered\n    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for accessible formats\n    And training should be available remotely and asynchronously\n    And caregivers should not be excluded from advancement opportunities\n    And professional growth should be possible during caregiving years\n    And workplace should provide flexible development paths\n\n  Scenario: Caregiver employee resource groups provide peer support\n    Given James is isolated from professional community by caregiving\n    And connection to other caregiver employees would help\n    When the workplace_elohim organizes caregiver support\n    Then employee resource groups should include caregivers\n    And caregiver employees should connect with each other\n    And workplace should facilitate caregiver peer support\n    And professional isolation should be reduced through connection\n    And caregivers should have voice in workplace policy\n\n  Scenario: Documentation of care work value for future employment\n    Given James's care work develops valuable professional skills\n    And years of family caregiving should count as experience\n    When the workplace_elohim documents James's care work\n    Then it should quantify care contributions professionally\n    And care skills should be framed as professional development\n    And documentation should support future employment applications\n    And family caregiving should be recognized as professional experience\n    And care economy should translate to employment economy value\n",
