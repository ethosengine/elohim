Provincial/State-Level Appeal Process for Appellant\n  As an appellant in the governance system\n  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer\n  I want appeals that establish regional constitutional precedent\n  So that complex cases and novel situations get proper deliberation and create guidance\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the appellant user is registered in the system\n    And the provincial_state governance context is active\n    And Regional Constitutional Council handles escalated appeals and novel cases\n\n  Scenario: Escalated appeal reaches Regional Constitutional Council\n    Given my appeal couldn't be resolved at community layer\n    And I escalated to peer agent review which affirmed the decision\n    When I request Constitutional Council review at regional level\n    Then randomly-selected citizens from across the region review my case\n    And They include Sarah Martinez, a nurse serving her 3-month term\n    And They deliberate for substantive time (2+ hours for complex cases)\n    And They have access to technical experts to explain complex aspects\n    And They create precedent that affects multiple communities in the region\n    And I receive judgment within one month of reaching this layer\n    And The decision includes detailed constitutional reasoning\n\n  Scenario: Appeal establishes novel constitutional precedent\n    Given my case involves a situation not previously addressed\n    And existing precedents don't clearly apply to my circumstances\n    When Regional Constitutional Council deliberates my case\n    Then they engage deeply with constitutional principles\n    And They consider multiple interpretations and their implications\n    And They consult technical experts about what's technically possible\n    And They examine similar cases from other regions for comparison\n    And They create new precedent with careful reasoning\n    And The precedent becomes part of public constitutional record\n    And Future similar cases reference my appeal's constitutional interpretation\n\n  Scenario: Appeal involves technical complexity requiring expert testimony\n    Given my appeal concerns cryptographic verification of agent reasoning\n    And I question whether the agent actually followed claimed constitutional principles\n    When Technical Expert Dr. Amara Okonkwo testifies to the Constitutional Council\n    Then she explains the cryptographic proof in accessible language\n    And She clarifies what confidence levels mean and their limitations\n    And She acknowledges uncertainties in the technical analysis\n    And She presents competing interpretations when experts disagree\n    And She informs but doesn't dictate the council's judgment\n    And The council weighs technical information alongside human wisdom\n    And I understand the technical basis of the decision through her explanation\n\n  Scenario: Cross-community appeal requiring regional coordination\n    Given my appeal involves agent decisions affecting multiple communities\n    And communities have different local calibrations creating conflict\n    When Regional Constitutional Council reviews the inter-community issue\n    Then they evaluate how subsidiarity principle applies across communities\n    And They examine if regional coordination is constitutionally required\n    And They consider if local diversity should be preserved or harmonized\n    And They may establish regional minimums while allowing local variation\n    And They create precedent for how communities coordinate at scale\n    And My appeal contributes to multi-layer governance coherence\n\n  Scenario: Appeal reveals systematic bias across multiple communities\n    Given similar appeals have been filed across many communities in the region\n    And a pattern suggests systematic issue not isolated incidents\n    When I file my appeal as part of this broader pattern\n    Then Regional Constitutional Council treats this as systemic review\n    And Researcher provides analysis of the appeal pattern data\n    And They investigate if protocol implementation has regional bias\n    And They examine if certain demographics are disproportionately affected\n    And They may order regional protocol audit or recalibration\n    And My individual appeal becomes part of systemic justice work\n    And Constitutional accountability operates at scale not just individual cases\n\n  Scenario: Appeal involving cultural specificity vs constitutional minimums\n    Given my community has cultural practices that differ from regional norms\n    And an agent decision applied regional default rather than local calibration\n    When I appeal based on cultural context\n    Then Regional Constitutional Council evaluates legitimate cultural diversity\n    And They distinguish between cultural variation and constitutional violations\n    And They examine if my community had ability to calibrate protocol appropriately\n    And They consider if agent should have recognized cultural context\n    And They balance universal human dignity with cultural specificity\n    And The precedent clarifies how constitutional minimums apply across cultures\n    And My appeal protects cultural diversity within constitutional framework\n\n  Scenario: Appeal outcome influences provincial policy making\n    Given my appeal revealed gap between agent governance and state law\n    And Constitutional Council recommendations identify needed legal changes\n    When Senator Ruiz reviews appeal precedents for policy insights\n    Then she uses my case as evidence in legislative hearings\n    And She crafts legislation addressing the constitutional gap\n    And She cites the council's reasoning in justifying policy changes\n    And My individual appeal contributes to democratic policy improvement\n    And Constitutional governance and representative democracy work together\n    And Policy makers learn from Constitutional Council wisdom\n\n  Scenario: Appeal with significant regional impact gets extensive deliberation\n    Given my case could affect thousands of families across the region\n    And the constitutional question has major implications\n    When Regional Constitutional Council reviews my high-stakes appeal\n    Then they allocate substantial time (multiple sessions over weeks)\n    And They invite testimony from diverse community leaders\n    And They consult with technical experts on implementation implications\n    And They examine long-term consequences of different interpretations\n    And They consider dissenting views and minority perspectives\n    And They produce comprehensive written opinion with reasoning\n    And The thorough deliberation legitimates the significant precedent they create\n\n  Scenario: Dissenting opinion preserved in regional precedent\n    Given Regional Constitutional Council deliberates my appeal\n    And the council reaches majority decision but some members disagree\n    When the precedent is documented\n    Then dissenting opinions are included with their reasoning\n    And The dissent explains alternative constitutional interpretation\n    And Future councils can reference both majority and dissent\n    And Constitutional evolution can draw on minority wisdom later\n    And My appeal generates rich constitutional dialogue not just single answer\n    And Disagreement is honored as part of democratic deliberation\n\n  Scenario: Appeal precedent cited in research on democratic AI governance\n    Given my appeal created important regional precedent\n    And Dr. James Chen is researching constitutional council effectiveness\n    When he analyzes appeal patterns and outcomes\n    Then my case (anonymized) becomes research data\n    And The precedent illustrates how sortition governance works\n    And Research findings feed back into protocol improvement\n    And My appeal contributes to global understanding of democratic AI governance\n    And Individual justice and systemic learning happen together\n\n  Scenario: Rapid appeal review during regional crisis\n    Given a regional crisis requires many urgent agent decisions\n    And I need to appeal a crisis-related decision quickly\n    When Regional Constitutional Council convenes emergency session\n    Then they balance speed with deliberation quality\n    And They evaluate if emergency protocols were properly invoked\n    And They examine if crisis urgency justified departures from normal process\n    And They provide expedited review (48-72 hours) while maintaining rigor\n    And They create precedent for crisis governance\n    And My appeal ensures democratic accountability even under emergency conditions\n",
