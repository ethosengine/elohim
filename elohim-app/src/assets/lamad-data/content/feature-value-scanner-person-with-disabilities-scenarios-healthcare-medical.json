Healthcare Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities\n  As a person with disabilities navigating medical systems\n  Operating at the healthcare/medical governance layer\n  I want to maintain authority over my body and receive respectful care\n  So that medical systems serve my flourishing rather than pathologizing my existence\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the person_with_disabilities user \"Alex\" is registered in the system\n    And Alex has cerebral palsy requiring ongoing medical management\n    And Alex navigates medical systems constantly (specialists, therapy, equipment)\n    And the healthcare governance context is active\n    And Alex's personal_agent supports medical advocacy\n    And medical relationships are often fraught with ableist assumptions\n\n  Scenario: Alex maintains authority over their own body and treatment\n    Given medical providers often assume they know what's best for disabled patients\n    And Alex has deep expertise about their own body and disability\n    When Alex interacts with medical providers\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex assert bodily autonomy\n    And it should support Alex in refusing unwanted treatments\n    And it should remind providers that Alex is expert on their own needs\n    And medical decisions should remain under Alex's control\n    And the protocol should structurally defend Alex's medical self-determination\n    And informed consent should be meaningful, not coerced\n    And Alex's authority over their own body should be absolute\n\n  Scenario: Tracking medical care quality and provider competence\n    Given medical providers vary widely in disability competence\n    And poor care from ableist providers causes harm\n    When Alex receives medical care\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex track care quality\n    And it should document which providers respect Alex's autonomy\n    And it should identify patterns of ableist treatment\n    And Alex should be able to rate providers on disability competence\n    And quality tracking should help Alex find better providers\n    And the protocol should make provider accountability visible\n    And Alex should have data to advocate for better care\n\n  Scenario: Refusing treatments that prioritize normalization over flourishing\n    Given medical establishment often prioritizes making disabled people \"normal\"\n    And some treatments harm quality of life in pursuit of normalcy\n    When providers recommend treatments focused on normalization\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex evaluate treatments critically\n    And it should distinguish between treatments that improve Alex's life and those that pursue normalcy\n    And it should support Alex in refusing treatments that don't serve Alex's goals\n    And Alex's definition of quality of life should be respected\n    And the protocol should recognize that disabled lives are valuable as they are\n    And medical goals should align with Alex's flourishing, not societal comfort\n    And Alex should be supported in rejecting medical model thinking\n\n  Scenario: Documenting medical discrimination and ableism\n    Given medical systems frequently discriminate against disabled people\n    And ableism in healthcare can be life-threatening\n    When Alex experiences medical discrimination\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex document discriminatory incidents\n    And it should identify patterns of discriminatory treatment\n    And it should connect Alex to legal resources and advocacy organizations\n    And documentation should support complaints to licensing boards\n    And the protocol should take medical discrimination seriously\n    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves from medical harm\n    And systemic patterns should be made visible for accountability\n\n  Scenario: Navigating medical equipment needs with dignity\n    Given Alex requires various medical equipment and devices\n    And equipment access is often bureaucratic and dehumanizing\n    When Alex needs medical equipment\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex navigate equipment systems\n    And it should track equipment needs and maintenance schedules\n    And it should help Alex advocate for appropriate equipment\n    And it should document when insurance denies necessary equipment\n    And Alex should maintain dignity throughout equipment acquisition\n    And the protocol should reduce bureaucratic burden\n    And equipment should be framed as essential tools, not medical devices\n\n  Scenario: Managing complex medication regimens with cognitive support\n    Given Alex may have multiple medications with complex schedules\n    And medication management is cognitively demanding\n    When Alex manages medications\n    Then the personal_agent should provide medication reminders\n    And it should track medication schedules and adherence\n    And it should alert Alex to potential interactions\n    And it should help Alex communicate with prescribers\n    And cognitive support should reduce medication management burden\n    And the protocol should serve Alex's health goals\n    And Alex should maintain control over medication decisions\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating multiple specialists while maintaining integrated care\n    Given Alex sees multiple medical specialists\n    And specialists often don't communicate with each other\n    When Alex navigates specialist care\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex coordinate across providers\n    And it should maintain integrated medical history across specialties\n    And it should help Alex communicate between providers\n    And it should identify care gaps or contradictions\n    And Alex should experience coherent care despite system fragmentation\n    And the protocol should serve as Alex's medical coordination hub\n    And integrated perspective should be maintained by Alex, not system\n\n  Scenario: Protecting Alex from quality of life assumptions\n    Given medical providers often make negative assumptions about disabled people's quality of life\n    And these assumptions can lead to withheld or substandard care\n    When providers discuss treatment options\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex challenge quality of life assumptions\n    And it should assert that Alex's life is valuable and worth full treatment\n    And it should document when providers suggest limiting care based on disability\n    And Alex should receive same standard of care as non-disabled patients\n    And the protocol should recognize that quality of life bias is discrimination\n    And Alex's right to full medical care should be defended\n    And assumptions about disability should never limit treatment options\n\n  Scenario: Preventing medical gaslighting and dismissal of symptoms\n    Given medical providers often dismiss disabled patients' symptom reports\n    And medical gaslighting is common experience for disabled people\n    When Alex reports new symptoms or health concerns\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex document symptom patterns\n    And it should track which providers take Alex's reports seriously\n    And it should support Alex in insisting on appropriate investigation\n    And it should help Alex distinguish new symptoms from existing disability\n    And Alex's expertise about their own body should be validated\n    And the protocol should help Alex advocate against medical dismissal\n    And symptom documentation should support Alex in being believed\n\n  Scenario: Managing medical appointments with accessibility considerations\n    Given medical facilities are often inaccessible\n    And appointment logistics are complex with disability\n    When Alex schedules medical appointments\n    Then the personal_agent should help verify facility accessibility\n    And it should coordinate transportation and support services\n    And it should prepare accessibility information for providers in advance\n    And it should track appointment schedules across multiple providers\n    And logistics coordination should reduce Alex's burden\n    And the protocol should make medical access less stressful\n    And barriers should be identified and addressed proactively\n\n  Scenario: Insurance navigation and benefits advocacy\n    Given disability-related medical costs are substantial\n    And insurance systems are complex and often deny coverage\n    When Alex navigates insurance systems\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex understand insurance benefits\n    And it should track what's covered and what's been denied\n    And it should support Alex in appeals processes\n    And it should document medical necessity for needed services\n    And Alex should have support in fighting insurance denials\n    And the protocol should reduce insurance navigation burden\n    And Alex should be able to access needed care despite insurance barriers\n\n  Scenario: Building relationships with disability-competent providers\n    Given finding good disability-competent providers is challenging\n    And quality provider relationships are essential for good care\n    When Alex seeks new providers\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex identify disability-competent providers\n    And it should maintain provider ratings from disability community\n    And it should help Alex interview potential providers about disability approach\n    And it should support Alex in building strong therapeutic relationships\n    And Alex should be able to find providers who respect disabled expertise\n    And the protocol should facilitate connection to good care\n    And disability community knowledge should be leveraged to find competent providers\n\n  Scenario: Medical privacy protects Alex from unauthorized disclosure\n    Given medical information is highly sensitive\n    And disability status can lead to discrimination if disclosed\n    When Alex's medical information is collected\n    Then the personal_agent should ensure strict medical privacy\n    And it should control what medical information is shared with whom\n    And workplace should never receive medical details\n    And family should only access what Alex permits\n    And insurance should receive minimum necessary information\n    And Alex's medical privacy should be maximally protected\n    And the protocol should prevent unauthorized medical disclosure systematically\n",
