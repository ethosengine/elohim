  "content": "Scenario: Teen coordinates care work across community contexts\n    Given Jasmine works part-time, volunteers, and contributes to family\n    And these contexts are all part of community care economy\n    When the community_elohim aggregates her contributions\n    Then all care work should be visible in integrated view\n    And she should see how her contributions connect across contexts\n    And understand that paid work, household labor, and volunteering are all care economy\n    And develop sophisticated understanding of how care creates value in multiple forms\n    And learn to manage complexity while maintaining coherent identity\n    And see herself as participating in integrated community care economy\n",
