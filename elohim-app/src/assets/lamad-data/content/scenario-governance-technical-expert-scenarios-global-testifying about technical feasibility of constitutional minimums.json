  "content": "Scenario: Testifying about technical feasibility of constitutional minimums\n    Given delegates establish universal constitutional minimums\n    And technical implementation varies by context\n    When I assess whether minimums are technically achievable globally\n    Then I evaluate: what infrastructure different minimums require\n    And I identify: barriers in low-resource contexts\n    And I explore: how to enable universal implementation\n    And I avoid: either blocking good governance or ignoring challenges\n    And I provide: honest assessment of feasibility\n    And I enable: delegates to set minimums wisely\n    And I serve: global justice through technical honesty\n",
