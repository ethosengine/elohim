  "content": "Scenario: Municipal Elohim provides cross-neighborhood insights\n    Given different neighborhoods have distinct challenges\n    And patterns aren't visible at single-neighborhood scale\n    When Municipal Elohim synthesizes cross-neighborhood data\n    Then I see: resource flows between neighborhoods\n    And I identify: opportunities for coordination\n    And I notice: problems emerging in multiple areas\n    And I recognize: how neighborhoods affect each other\n    And I use: this information for city council decisions\n    And I maintain: human judgment over agent information\n    And agent enhances: my understanding without replacing leadership\n",
