  "content": "Feature: Industry-Level Worker Advocacy and Sector Transformation\n  As a worker in the food service industry\n  I need to participate in industry-level advocacy for systemic change\n  So that workers across the sector gain dignity, fair compensation, and care-aligned conditions\n\n  Background:\n    Given I work in the food service industry\n    And the industry is characterized by low wages, poor conditions, and high turnover\n    And the protocol connects workers across the industry\n    And industry-level advocacy can create systemic change\n\n  Scenario: Connecting with workers across food service industry\n    Given food service workers face similar exploitation patterns\n    And collective action requires cross-workplace organization\n    When I want to connect with other food service workers\n    Then the protocol should facilitate industry-wide worker networks\n    And help me find worker organizing groups and unions\n    And support building solidarity across restaurants and food businesses\n    And enable coordination for industry-level advocacy\n\n  Scenario: Documenting industry-wide exploitation patterns\n    Given low wages and poor conditions are systemic across food service\n    When the protocol aggregates data from workers across the industry\n    Then it should identify widespread exploitation patterns\n    And make visible that individual workplace problems are systemic\n    And provide evidence for industry-level policy advocacy\n    And demonstrate need for sector transformation\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for industry-wide living wage standards\n    Given current food service wages are systematically too low to live on\n    When workers organize for living wage campaigns\n    Then the protocol should support industry-wide living wage advocacy\n    And provide evidence of inadequate current wages\n    And help workers coordinate collective demands\n    And build movement for mandatory living wage in food service\n\n  Scenario: Pushing for industry scheduling regulations\n    Given unpredictable scheduling is endemic in food service\n    When workers advocate for fair scheduling laws\n    Then the protocol should support advocacy for scheduling regulations\n    Such as advance notice requirements, predictable hours, right to request schedule\n    And provide evidence of harm from current scheduling practices\n    And coordinate workers pushing for legislative change\n    And transform industry standards through policy intervention\n\n  Scenario: Organizing for universal benefits in food service\n    Given many food service workers lack health insurance, paid leave, or retirement\n    When workers advocate for universal benefits\n    Then the protocol should support campaigns for mandatory benefits\n    And help workers articulate need for healthcare, sick leave, and security\n    And coordinate advocacy for industry-wide benefit requirements\n    And push for decoupling essential benefits from individual employer provision\n\n  Scenario: Challenging tipped wage systems\n    Given tipped minimum wage is exploitative and creates instability\n    When workers organize to eliminate tipped wage and demand full minimum wage\n    Then the protocol should support advocacy for one fair wage\n    And provide evidence of problems with tipped wage systems\n    And help workers coordinate across tipped industries\n    And push for legislative elimination of tipped wage carveouts\n\n  Scenario: Addressing industry culture of exploitation\n    Given food service industry culture normalizes worker exploitation\n    When workers want to transform industry culture\n    Then the protocol should support cultural change advocacy\n    And help workers articulate vision for dignified food service work\n    And build consciousness that current conditions are unjust not inevitable\n    And create movement for care-economy-aligned industry transformation\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for industry training and skill development\n    Given food service work involves significant skill but is undervalued\n    When workers advocate for professional development and advancement paths\n    Then the protocol should support advocacy for industry training programs\n    And help workers demand investment in skill development\n    And push for career pathways and mobility within industry\n    And challenge perception of food service as unskilled disposable labor\n\n  Scenario: Organizing around food worker food insecurity\n    Given food service workers often cannot afford adequate food despite preparing food\n    When this contradiction becomes visible\n    Then the protocol should help organize around food worker food security\n    And advocate for meal provisions as standard for food workers\n    And push for wages that enable workers to afford quality food\n    And make visible the injustice of hungry people feeding others\n\n  Scenario: Building worker power through industry-wide organizing\n    Given individual workers and workplaces have limited power\n    When workers organize across the industry\n    Then the protocol should facilitate industry-wide organizing\n    And support union drives and worker organization formation\n    And coordinate collective action across workplaces\n    And build worker power sufficient to transform industry conditions\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for worker ownership and cooperative models\n    Given current ownership structures extract from workers\n    When workers want to explore alternative ownership models\n    Then the protocol should provide information about worker cooperatives\n    And connect workers interested in cooperative organizing\n    And support transition toward worker ownership in food service\n    And build examples of care-economy-aligned food business models\n\n  Scenario: Participating in industry policy advocacy\n    Given policy changes can transform industry conditions\n    When legislation affecting food service workers is under consideration\n    Then the protocol should alert workers to policy opportunities\n    And facilitate participation in legislative advocacy\n    And coordinate worker testimony and organizing for policy change\n    And build political power for worker-supportive policy\n\n  Scenario: Making visible that industry depends on worker care labor\n    Given the food service industry depends entirely on workers' care labor\n    And workers are serving essential human needs (nourishment and community)\n    When the industry narrative treats workers as disposable\n    Then the protocol should make visible workers' essential contributions\n    And reframe food service as care work serving community flourishing\n    And build consciousness that workers deserve dignity and fair compensation\n    And transform industry culture from extraction to care economy alignment\n",
