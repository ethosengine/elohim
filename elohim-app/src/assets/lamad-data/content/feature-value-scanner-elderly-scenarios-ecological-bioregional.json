Ecological/Bioregional Layer Environmental Wisdom for Elderly\n  As an elderly person in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want to contribute my accumulated environmental knowledge\n  So that my lifetime of observation informs ecological stewardship\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the elderly user \"Helen\" is registered in the system\n    And Helen has 82 years of observing environmental patterns\n    And Helen grew up with pre-industrial sustainable practices\n    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active\n    And elder environmental wisdom has unique value\n\n  Scenario: Lifetime environmental observations inform climate data\n    Given Helen has observed local environmental changes over 8+ decades\n    And her memory includes baseline data from pre-industrial era\n    When Helen shares environmental observations\n    Then her knowledge should be captured for ecological archives\n    And her observations should inform local climate understanding\n    And personal experience should be valued alongside scientific data\n    And care tokens should reflect her contribution to environmental knowledge\n    And the protocol should recognize elders as environmental historians\n    And Helen's lifetime of observation should contribute to bioregional stewardship\n    And indigenous elder knowledge methods should inform data collection\n\n  Scenario: Traditional sustainable practices preserved through elder teaching\n    Given Helen learned pre-consumer household management\n    And she knows seasonal food preservation, waste reduction, and resource conservation\n    When Helen teaches traditional sustainable practices\n    Then her knowledge should be recognized as environmental education\n    And younger generations should learn low-impact living from her experience\n    And traditional practices should inform modern sustainability efforts\n    And Helen should be valued as expert in sustainable living\n    And the protocol should facilitate skills transfer from pre-disposable era\n    And ecological wisdom should be preserved through intergenerational teaching\n    And Helen's knowledge should contribute to reduced environmental impact\n\n  Scenario: Seasonal pattern knowledge from decades of observation\n    Given Helen has observed local seasonal patterns for 82 years\n    And climate change is altering traditional seasonal cycles\n    When Helen shares knowledge of historical seasonal patterns\n    Then her observations should inform understanding of climate shifts\n    And bioregional planning should incorporate elder memory\n    And changes should be documented through personal testimony\n    And Helen should be recognized as expert on local ecology\n    And the protocol should preserve knowledge of pre-change conditions\n    And ecological governance should include elder perspectives\n    And baseline understanding should come from those who remember\n\n  Scenario: Reduced consumption wisdom from experience of less\n    Given Helen grew up with material scarcity\n    And she knows how to live well with less\n    When Helen shares wisdom about reduced consumption\n    Then her experience should inform degrowth and sustainability education\n    And consumer capitalism should be challenged by her lived alternative\n    And younger generations should learn that happiness doesn't require endless acquisition\n    And Helen should be valued for knowledge that contradicts market economics\n    And the protocol should surface elder wisdom about sufficiency\n    And ecological sustainability should learn from those who lived with less\n    And Helen's experience should teach that less can be enough\n\n  Scenario: Local food systems knowledge from pre-industrial era\n    Given Helen remembers more localized food systems\n    And she knows seasonal availability and regional food traditions\n    When Helen contributes to local food system planning\n    Then her knowledge should inform food sovereignty efforts\n    And bioregional food systems should learn from her memory\n    And traditional food preservation should be taught by those who practiced it\n    And Helen should be recognized as expert in local food culture\n    And the protocol should preserve pre-globalization food knowledge\n    And sustainable food systems should incorporate elder wisdom\n    And Helen's knowledge should reduce dependence on industrial food systems\n\n  Scenario: Ecological care integrated with personal purchasing decisions\n    Given Helen uses Value Scanner for shopping\n    And her choices have environmental impact\n    When Helen makes purchasing decisions\n    Then ecological impact should be surfaced at appropriate cognitive level\n    And her personal_agent should support environmentally conscious choices\n    And information should be presented simply: \"Local tomatoes from nearby farm\"\n    And ecological care should be framed as care for community\n    And Helen should be supported in environmental stewardship within her capabilities\n    And the protocol should enable ecological values in daily decisions\n    And sustainability should be accessible regardless of cognitive limitations\n\n  Scenario: Garden and plant knowledge shared with community\n    Given Helen has decades of gardening experience\n    And she knows local plants, soil conditions, and growing patterns\n    When Helen shares gardening and plant knowledge\n    Then her expertise should be recognized as ecological contribution\n    And community gardens should benefit from elder expertise\n    And traditional plant knowledge should be preserved\n    And care tokens should reflect her environmental teaching\n    And the protocol should connect elder plant experts with community gardens\n    And bioregional food sovereignty should be supported by elder knowledge\n    And Helen's experience should enable local food production\n\n  Scenario: Weather pattern knowledge from lifetime of observation\n    Given Helen has observed local weather patterns for 82 years\n    And her memory includes pre-climate change baselines\n    When Helen describes historical weather patterns\n    Then her observations should inform climate adaptation planning\n    And community should learn from her memory of normal patterns\n    And changes should be understood through personal testimony\n    And bioregional climate knowledge should include elder perspectives\n    And the protocol should capture knowledge before it's lost\n    And Helen's observations should contribute to local climate understanding\n    And environmental memory should be preserved through elder participation\n\n  Scenario: Frugality as environmental practice recognized and valued\n    Given Helen's resource constraint requires careful consumption\n    And frugality reduces environmental impact\n    When Helen makes resource-conscious decisions\n    Then her frugality should be recognized as environmental stewardship\n    And poverty should not be stigmatized when it reduces consumption\n    And her low-impact lifestyle should be valued, not pitied\n    And care tokens should reflect environmental benefit of reduced consumption\n    And the protocol should challenge assumption that consumption equals flourishing\n    And Helen's economic constraint should be reframed as ecological wisdom\n    And environmental movement should learn from those who live with less by necessity\n\n  Scenario: Connection to place through decades of residence\n    Given Helen has lived in same bioregion for 82 years\n    And deep place-based knowledge develops over lifetime\n    When bioregional governance makes land use decisions\n    Then Helen's intimate knowledge of place should inform planning\n    And longtime residents should have standing in ecological governance\n    And her connection to land should be valued in decision-making\n    And the protocol should elevate voices of those with deep place-knowledge\n    And bioregional stewardship should prioritize those who've observed place over time\n    And Helen's decades of residence should give her ecological authority\n    And land use should consider those who remember land's history\n\n  Scenario: Traditional water conservation from era of scarcity\n    Given Helen learned water conservation in era without modern plumbing\n    And water scarcity is increasing due to climate change\n    When Helen teaches water conservation practices\n    Then her knowledge should inform community water management\n    And traditional conservation practices should be revived\n    And younger generations should learn from those who conserved by necessity\n    And Helen should be recognized as expert in water conservation\n    And the protocol should preserve water wisdom before it's lost\n    And bioregional water management should incorporate elder knowledge\n    And Helen's experience should increase community water resilience\n\n  Scenario: End-of-life ecological considerations in care planning\n    Given Helen is planning for end of life\n    And death has ecological dimensions\n    When Helen makes end-of-life care decisions\n    Then ecological options should be presented as available choices\n    And natural burial or green funeral options should be surfaced\n    And her values about environmental impact should extend through death\n    And the protocol should support ecological considerations in dying\n    And bioregional care economy should include sustainable death practices\n    And Helen's environmental values should guide her death as they guided her life\n    And end of life should be opportunity to minimize environmental harm\n\n  Scenario: Climate grief and loss acknowledged in elderly experience\n    Given Helen has witnessed massive environmental change\n    And loss of familiar ecosystems causes grief\n    When Helen expresses climate grief\n    Then her emotional response should be validated and supported\n    And loss of familiar nature should be acknowledged as legitimate grief\n    And the protocol should recognize that elders witness most environmental loss\n    And climate change impacts include psychological dimensions\n    And Helen's grief should be honored, not dismissed\n    And witnessing ecological destruction across lifetime should be recognized as trauma\n    And elder perspectives should inform community understanding of what's being lost\n",
