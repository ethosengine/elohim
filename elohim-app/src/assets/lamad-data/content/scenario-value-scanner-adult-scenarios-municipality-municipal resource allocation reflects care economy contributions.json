  "content": "Scenario: Municipal resource allocation reflects care economy contributions\n    Given Sarah and others contribute substantially to community care\n    And municipal budgets allocate significant resources\n    When municipal budgets are decided\n    Then care economy contributions should be visible to decision makers\n    And resource allocation should recognize care creates value\n    And neighborhoods with strong care economy should receive support\n    And municipal investment should strengthen care economy infrastructure\n    And budgets should reflect that care work is economically valuable\n",
