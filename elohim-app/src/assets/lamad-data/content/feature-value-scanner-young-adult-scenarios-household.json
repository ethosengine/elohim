Household Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult\n  As a young adult managing my first independent household\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want to coordinate shared resources and responsibilities effectively\n  So that I build sustainable household management practices\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the young_adult user \"Aisha\" is registered in the system\n    And Aisha lives in her first solo apartment\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And Aisha's personal_agent coordinates household management\n    And household care economy is being tracked\n\n  Scenario: Solo household management learning\n    Given Aisha lives alone in her first apartment\n    And household and individual layers largely overlap\n    When Aisha manages household resources\n    Then the personal_agent should help her establish routines\n    And it should track household maintenance tasks\n    And it should help her build sustainable practices\n    And household management should feel achievable, not overwhelming\n    And the system should scaffold her household competence development\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating shared household with roommates\n    Given Aisha has two roommates\n    And the household needs equitable resource distribution\n    When the household_elohim coordinates shared responsibilities\n    Then it should track each person's contributions\n    And it should help distribute household labor fairly\n    And it should manage shared grocery purchases\n    And it should coordinate cleaning and maintenance tasks\n    And the system should make invisible household work visible\n    And equity should be maintained through transparent tracking\n\n  Scenario: Shared grocery shopping with roommates\n    Given Aisha and her roommates share food costs\n    And they have different dietary preferences\n    When they use the Value Scanner for shared shopping\n    Then the household_elohim should track individual contributions\n    And it should manage the shared household budget\n    And it should accommodate different preferences within budget\n    And care tokens should reflect each person's shopping labor\n    And the system should prevent household conflicts over resources\n    And equitable cost-sharing should be transparent\n\n  Scenario: Household labor distribution made visible\n    Given Aisha does most of the cooking\n    And her roommate does most of the cleaning\n    When household care contributions are tracked\n    Then the household_elohim should make all labor visible\n    And it should show time invested by each person\n    And it should recognize different forms of household care\n    And invisible work should receive equal recognition\n    And the system should prevent exploitation through transparency\n    And household equity should be data-informed\n\n  Scenario: Building household management skills incrementally\n    Given Aisha has never managed a household before\n    And she's learning essential adult skills\n    When Aisha uses household management features\n    Then the personal_agent should teach skills progressively\n    And it should provide checklists for routine maintenance\n    And it should remind her of non-obvious tasks (changing air filters, etc.)\n    And education should integrate with task management\n    And Aisha should build comprehensive household competence\n    And the learning curve should feel supportive, not judgmental\n\n  Scenario: Managing household budget on entry-level income\n    Given Aisha's income is $38,000 annually\n    And rent consumes a large portion of her budget\n    When Aisha allocates household resources\n    Then the personal_agent should help optimize spending\n    And it should identify where to invest versus economize\n    And it should suggest cost-saving strategies appropriate to her situation\n    And budget tools should account for her income constraints\n    And the system should help her achieve sustainability within limits\n\n  Scenario: Transition from family household to independent household\n    Given Aisha recently moved out of her family home\n    And she's adapting to independent household management\n    When Aisha establishes her household practices\n    Then the system should recognize this is a major transition\n    And it should help her adapt family practices to solo living\n    And it should provide continuity from family care economy patterns\n    And the personal_agent should acknowledge the learning curve\n    And support should smooth the jarring transition to full responsibility\n\n  Scenario: Household waste reduction on limited budget\n    Given Aisha wants to reduce waste\n    And she has limited resources to invest in sustainability\n    When the personal_agent analyzes household waste patterns\n    Then it should identify specific reduction opportunities\n    And it should suggest affordable waste reduction strategies\n    And it should track improvement over time\n    And recommendations should balance sustainability and budget constraints\n    And Aisha should build sustainable household practices within her means\n\n  Scenario: Roommate household operates as miniature care economy\n    Given Aisha lives with roommates\n    And the household functions as a care economy unit\n    When household care tokens are calculated\n    Then all forms of household labor should be valued\n    And cooking, cleaning, shopping, and maintenance should all count\n    And emotional labor of household coordination should be recognized\n    And care tokens should enable equitable exchange\n    And the household should function as mutual support network\n    And care economy principles should prevent household exploitation\n\n  Scenario: Household maintenance prevents costly emergencies\n    Given Aisha is learning household maintenance\n    And prevention is cheaper than emergency repairs\n    When the personal_agent tracks household maintenance\n    Then it should provide preventive maintenance schedules\n    And it should flag issues before they become emergencies\n    And it should educate about maintenance tasks Aisha might not know\n    And the system should protect her from expensive neglect\n    And household competence should include preventive thinking\n\n  Scenario: Transitioning household when roommate moves out\n    Given Aisha's roommate is moving out\n    And household responsibilities need redistribution\n    When the household composition changes\n    Then the household_elohim should help manage the transition\n    And it should recalculate resource allocations\n    And it should settle care token balances fairly\n    And it should help Aisha adjust to changed circumstances\n    And household transitions should be supported systematically\n\n  Scenario: Building sustainable household routines\n    Given Aisha wants to establish effective household practices\n    And sustainable routines reduce decision fatigue\n    When Aisha develops household routines\n    Then the personal_agent should help her establish patterns\n    And it should track what routines are working\n    And it should suggest optimizations based on her actual behavior\n    And routines should be sustainable for her lifestyle and energy\n    And the system should help her build household practices that last\n",
