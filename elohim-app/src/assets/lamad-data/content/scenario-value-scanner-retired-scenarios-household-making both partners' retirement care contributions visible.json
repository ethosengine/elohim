  "content": "Scenario: Making both partners' retirement care contributions visible\n    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity\n    And his wife contributes different care labor to family and community\n    And both provide substantial unpaid care work\n    When the household_elohim tracks contributions\n    Then both partners' care work should be quantified specifically\n    And volunteer labor, family care, and community participation should be valued\n    And invisible labor imbalances should become visible\n    And both Frank and his wife should see who's doing what\n    And data should support equitable distribution conversations\n    And both partners' contributions should be recognized and celebrated\n",
