  "content": "Scenario: Democratic supply chain coordination provides volume purchasing power\n    Given individual farms and restaurants lack negotiating leverage with suppliers\n    And corporate chains use volume to extract favorable pricing\n    When democratic network coordinates purchasing across multiple entities\n    Then farmers coordinate to provide consistent supply achieving volume benefits\n    And restaurants coordinate orders achieving volume purchasing power\n    And democratic coordination provides efficiency without extraction\n    And small democratic entities match corporate scale through cooperation\n    And industry_sector_elohim facilitates coordinated purchasing and supply planning\n",
