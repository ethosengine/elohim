  "content": "Scenario: Explaining cryptographic constitutional proof to global assembly\n    Given delegates need to understand how constitutional verification works\n    And many come from contexts without technical infrastructure\n    When I explain cryptographic alignment proof accessibly\n    Then I use: universal analogies and visual demonstrations\n    And I ensure: translation into dozens of languages\n    And I check: comprehension across educational backgrounds\n    And I avoid: assuming Western technical education\n    And I honor: diverse ways of understanding verification\n    And I enable: informed global deliberation despite technical complexity\n    And I demonstrate: that anyone can understand enough to govern\n",
