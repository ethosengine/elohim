  "content": "Scenario: Advising on ecological standing amendment technical implications\n    Given delegates consider granting ecosystems constitutional personhood\n    And technical implementation is uncertain\n    When I explain how agents would implement ecological standing\n    Then I clarify: how ecosystem \"voice\" would be technically represented\n    And I explore: methods for translating ecological data into constitutional claims\n    And I assess: challenges in balancing human and ecological rights\n    And I present: what's technically possible vs what requires research\n    And I avoid: either dismissing as impossible or ignoring challenges\n    And I enable: delegates to choose values given technical reality\n    And I serve: constitutional innovation with technical honesty\n",
