They're considering a proposal to integrate local food sourcing into the district's meal program.*\n\n*Your testimony has been requested for next week's school board meeting. Data from the Fresh Food Hub pilot will inform district policy affecting 12,000 students across 18 schools.*\n\n*Want to prepare? We'll help you tell the story.*\n\nSarah stares at her phone. Four months ago, she was a parent struggling with invisible care work and midnight burnout. Today, she's being asked to shape **district-level policy** that will affect thousands of families.\n\nThis is the **district layer**\u2014where successful community experiments scale to policy, where patterns across multiple neighborhoods inform institutional decision-making, and where parents like Sarah transition from grassroots organizing to governance participation.\n\n## The Story\n\n**Monday, 6:00 PM - Understanding the Proposal**\n\nSarah opens the district_elohim briefing document on her tablet while Tommy and Emma do homework. The briefing is remarkably clear\u2014not bureaucratic jargon, but actual information:\n\n**Lincoln School District - Local Food Integration Proposal**\n\n**Current Reality:**\n- 18 schools, 12,000 students\n- 67% qualify for free/reduced lunch\n- $2.3 million annual food budget\n- Current sourcing: 94% from national food service corporation (Sysco)\n- Food cost: $3.20 per student meal\n- Local food sourcing: 6% (minimal)\n\n**What's Changed:**\nIn the past 3 months, **four community food hubs** launched across the district using the Lincoln Park model:\n1. Lincoln Park Hub: 73 families, $68K/year circulating locally\n2. Riverside Hub: 54 families, $51K/year\n3. Northside Hub: 89 families (larger community), $87K/year\n4. Eastwood Hub: 61 families, $59K/year\n\n**Aggregate District Impact:**\n- 277 families (2% of district) participating\n- $265K/year shifted to local farms (from $0 before)\n- 6 local farms now have stable revenue streams\n- Parent-reported child produce consumption: +62% average\n- Community care tokens distributed: 14,500 (volunteer coordination and subsidies)\n\n**The Proposal:**\nIntegrate local farms into school meal program:\n- **Goal:** 30% of school food budget ($690K/year) to local farms within 2 years\n- **Mechanism:** District contracts directly with farms coordinated through community hubs\n- **Scale:** Bulk purchasing power of 12,000 meals/day makes local farming economically viable\n- **Implementation:** Phased rollout, starting with 3 pilot schools\n\n**What It Means:**\n- $690K/year staying in local economy (vs. leaving to national corporation)\n- 8-10 local farms with guaranteed contracts (economic stability)\n- Students eating food grown within 50 miles (nutrition + education)\n- Parents' care economy networks become district infrastructure partners\n\n**Your Role:**\nSchool board wants to hear from parent leaders of community hubs. **They're asking: Does this work? Should the district invest public resources in local food systems?**\n\nSarah realizes: The midnight reflection that started her journey (individual layer) \u2192 fed into family rebalancing (family layer) \u2192 enabled neighborhood care swaps (neighborhood layer) \u2192 seeded the community food hub (community layer) \u2192 is now informing **district policy** that will affect 12,000 kids.\n\n**Tuesday, 4:00 PM - Coalition Preparation**\n\nSarah meets with the other three community hub coordinators at the district community center. District_elohim has brought them together:\n\n- **Sarah** (Lincoln Park): Parent, white, middle-class, tech-savvy\n- **Maria** (Northside): Single parent, Latina, working-class, passionate advocate\n- **James** (Riverside): Retired Black teacher, deep community roots, respected elder\n- **Priya** (Eastwood): Small business owner, Indian-American, community center operator\n\nThey've never met in person, but they've been watching each other's hubs succeed through anonymized data sharing. District_elohim shows them the combined pattern:\n\n**District-Wide Fresh Food Network:**\n\n**Economic Pattern:**\n- 4 hubs, 277 families, $265K local circulation\n- Proven model: Community coordination + care economy + bulk buying = viable local food system\n- If scaled to 30% district participation (3,600 families): $3.4 million local circulation\n- This doesn't include school meals ($690K additional)\n- **Total potential: $4.1 million/year in local food economy** (vs. $47K currently)\n\n**Care Pattern:**\n- 89 active volunteers across 4 hubs (delivery, packing, coordination)\n- 14,500 care tokens distributed (invisible care work made visible and compensated)\n- Average volunteer reports: reduced isolation, increased purpose, meaningful income supplement\n- Teens: 1,200 verified service hours (college applications + civic learning)\n\n**Health Pattern:**\n- Participating families: +62% child produce consumption\n- Anecdotal reports: improved family cooking habits, reduced food waste\n- Community health workers report: fewer diet-related health complaints (small sample, but promising)\n\n**Equity Pattern:**\n- 34% of hub participants are low-income (using care token subsidies)\n- No families turned away for inability to pay\n- Cultural diversity of produce improving (Maria advocated for plantains, Priya for Indian vegetables)\n- Food access gap closing: Families with least access benefiting most\n\n**Challenge Pattern:**\n- Hub coordinators (mostly women) doing uncompensated emotional/organizational labor\n- Storage capacity limiting winter/root vegetable options\n- Transportation still barrier for some families\n- Farms need guaranteed contracts to expand (risk of growing more without stable demand)\n\n**The Opportunity:**\nDistrict investment could solve the bottlenecks:\n- Compensate hub coordinators (professionalize the care work)\n- Provide commercial kitchen/storage space (infrastructure the hubs can't afford)\n- Guaranteed school contracts give farms confidence to expand\n- District purchasing power makes 30% local sourcing economically viable\n\nThe four coordinators realize: **They're not just testifying about food. They're testifying about whether care economy infrastructure deserves public investment.**\n\n**Thursday, 7:00 PM - The School Board Meeting**\n\nThe board room is packed. Sarah sees:\n- Parents from all four community hubs (47 people came to support)\n- Teachers and school nutrition staff (curious and skeptical)\n- Local farmers (Johnson Farm and 5 others, hopeful)\n- Sysco representative (corporate food service, nervous about losing contract)\n- School board members (7 elected officials, mix of enthusiastic and concerned)\n- District superintendent (appointed, data-focused, seems intrigued)\n\nThe proposal is presented by the district's food services director. Then public comment opens.\n\n**Sarah's Testimony (3 minutes):**\n\n\"Three months ago, I was a parent drowning in invisible care work. I didn't know that buying strawberries for my daughter was part of an economic pattern affecting thousands of families.\n\nThe Elohim protocol made that pattern visible. It showed me that 847 families in Lincoln Park wanted fresh food but the infrastructure didn't exist. It connected me with Maria, with farmers like Mr. Johnson, with volunteers like James who drives the van that makes our hub possible.\n\nToday, 73 families in Lincoln Park eat fresh, local food every week. We've circulated $68,000 in our local economy. Six kids who never ate fresh vegetables now ask for them. Mr. Johnson hired a worker. James isn't lonely anymore.\n\n**But here's what matters for the district:**\n\nEvery week, parents in the hub spend 2-3 hours coordinating, packing, delivering food. That's care work\u2014invisible, uncompensated labor that makes the hub run. We do it because we believe in it. But it's not sustainable without support.\n\nMy kids eat at Lincoln Elementary. Every day, their lunch comes from a national corporation that extracts wealth from our community. What if, instead, their lunch came from Mr. Johnson's farm? What if the district's $2.3 million food budget stayed here, hired local workers, fed local families?\n\nThe four community hubs have proven the model works. **What we're asking is: Will the district invest public resources in local care economy infrastructure?**\n\nNot as charity. As economic development. As community resilience. As education\u2014because kids who know where their food comes from eat better and learn better.\n\nWe have the data. We have the farms. We have the families. What we need is the district's partnership.\"\n\nThe room applauds. Sarah sits down, heart pounding.\n\n**Maria's Testimony (3 minutes):**\n\nMaria speaks in Spanish (with real-time translation provided by district_elohim for board members):\n\n\"I work two jobs. I have three kids. Before the Northside Hub, I bought food at QuickMart because it was close and I didn't have time for anything else. My kids ate processed food because that's what I could afford and access.\n\nThe hub changed everything. I pick up fresh food on Saturday at the community center\u2014it's on my way home from work. I pay what I can, and when I can't pay cash, I use care tokens I earned by helping coordinate our neighborhood.\n\nMy daughter asked me last week: 'Mama, can we have those rainbow carrots again?' She's 8. She's excited about CARROTS.\n\n**But here's what the board needs to understand:**\n\nThis isn't about nice food for middle-class families. This is about equity. 89 families in Northside Hub are low-income. We're eating fresh food for the first time in years\u2014not because a charity gave it to us, but because we built a system that works for us.\n\nIf the school district sources local food, my kids will eat better at school. The farm workers who grow that food will have jobs. The care economy that makes it possible will be recognized and funded.\n\nThis is how you close food deserts. Not with more stores. With community infrastructure that values care work and circulates wealth locally.\n\nVote yes. Our kids are watching.\"\n\n**James's Testimony (3 minutes):**\n\n\"I taught in this district for 32 years. I've seen a lot of programs come and go. Most of them were top-down solutions that didn't understand the community.\n\nThis is different.\n\nI drive the van for the Riverside Hub. Every Saturday, I pick up food from farms and deliver it to families. I'm 68 years old. I thought my useful days were over. But this work gives me purpose.\n\nI'm also being compensated\u2014not much, but enough for gas and a little extra. More importantly, I'm earning care tokens that I use to get help with my yard work. The care economy values my contribution.\n\n**What I want the board to see:**\n\nThis isn't just about food. It's about multigenerational community. It's about kids seeing that Mr. Johnson grows their strawberries and that Mr. James delivers them and that Mrs. Priya provides the space where we pack them.\n\nWhen you eat food from people you know, you're not just a consumer. You're part of a community.\n\nThe school district has a choice: Keep sending millions to corporations, or invest in the people who already live here and care about these kids.\n\nI know which choice builds the kind of community where I want to live.\"\n\n**Priya's Testimony (3 minutes):**\n\n\"I run the Eastwood Community Center. When the food hub asked to use our space, I said yes because I believe in community. But I didn't realize how much this would transform our center.\n\nNow, every Saturday, 61 families come through. Parents meet each other. Kids volunteer. Elderly neighbors help pack boxes. Our community center has become what it was meant to be\u2014a place where community happens.\n\n**The economic impact is real:**\n\nThe hub pays rent for the space (using care token pools and member contributions). That rent helps keep the center open. The foot traffic brings people to our other programs. Local farms buy storage containers from my cousin's hardware store.\n\nThis is how local economics works\u2014every dollar circulates and creates value multiple times before it leaves the community.\n\n**But there's a challenge:**\n\nWe need cold storage and commercial kitchen space to expand. We need to move from improvised infrastructure to something sustainable. The district has kitchen space in schools that sits empty on weekends. The district has purchasing power that could guarantee farm contracts.\n\nThe partnership makes sense. We bring the community networks and the care economy infrastructure. You bring the institutional capacity and the public investment.\n\nTogether, we can build a food system that serves everyone.\"\n\n**The Opposition (3 minutes - Sysco representative):**\n\n\"We appreciate the passion of these community members. But let's talk about practicality.\n\nSysco provides reliable, safe, cost-effective food service to school districts nationwide. We meet federal nutrition standards. We have logistics infrastructure. We provide insurance and liability coverage.\n\nCan local farms guarantee year-round supply? Can community volunteers meet health department standards? What happens when a farm has a bad harvest?\n\nThe district's responsibility is to feed 12,000 kids every day, reliably and safely. That requires professional food service, not well-meaning experiments.\n\nWe're willing to increase our local sourcing from 6% to 10%. But replacing 30% of our contract with unproven community networks is risky and irresponsible.\"\n\n**8:30 PM - The Data Presentation**\n\nDistrict_elohim displays verified impact data on the screen:\n\n**Community Hubs - 3-Month verified results:**\n\n**Reliability:**\n- 12 weeks of operation across 4 hubs\n- 0 weeks with food safety incidents\n- 99.2% on-time delivery rate\n- 100% customer satisfaction (verified survey data)\n\n**Economic:**\n- $265,000 local circulation (verified transactions)\n- 6 farms with stable revenue increases (avg +34%)\n- 89 community members compensated for care work (verified care token distribution)\n- Cost to families: 30% less than grocery store (economies of scale)\n\n**Health:**\n- 62% increase in child produce consumption (parent-reported, verified)\n- 23% reduction in food waste (compared to typical grocery shopping)\n- 100% compliance with nutrition guidelines (same as Sysco)\n\n**Scalability:**\n- Model replicated in 4 distinct communities (demographic diversity tested)\n- Infrastructure requirements: clearly documented\n- Risk mitigation: backup farms identified, storage capacity mapped\n- Year-round supply: seasonal planning with preservation/storage protocols\n\n**Public Investment Needed:**\n- Commercial kitchen/storage space: $80K one-time capital\n- Hub coordinator compensation: $120K/year (4 hubs \u00d7 $30K stipend)\n- Farm contract guarantees: $690K/year (already budgeted for food)\n- District coordination staff: 0.5 FTE ($40K/year)\n- **Total new investment: $240K/year + $80K one-time**\n\n**Return on Investment:**\n- $690K/year staying local (vs. leaving to national corporation)\n- 8-10 local jobs created (farm workers, hub coordinators)\n- Student nutrition improvement (long-term health cost savings)\n- Community resilience infrastructure (serves beyond just food)\n\nThe superintendent speaks: \"I've reviewed this data carefully. The pilot results are compelling. My question for the board is: Are we ready to invest public resources in care economy infrastructure?\"\n\n**9:00 PM - The Board Votes**\n\nAfter 30 minutes of board member questions and deliberation:\n\n**Motion: Approve 2-year pilot of Local Food Integration Program, starting with 3 schools, with $240K/year budget and $80K capital investment.**\n\nVote:\n- Yes: 5 board members\n- No: 1 board member (concerned about risk)\n- Abstain: 1 board member (owns shares in food service company, conflict of interest)\n\n**The pilot is approved.**\n\nThe room erupts in applause. Sarah looks at Maria, James, and Priya. Four months ago, they were strangers. Tonight, they changed district policy.\n\n**Six Months Later - The Impact**\n\nSarah receives the district_elohim impact report:\n\n**Lincoln School District Local Food Pilot - 6 Month Results:**\n\n**Schools Participating:** 3 (expanding to 6 next semester)\n**Students Served:** 2,800 (23% of district)\n**Local Food Percentage:** 28% (on track for 30% target)\n\n**Economic:**\n- $347,000 spent with local farms (6 months)\n- 12 farms now have district contracts (up from 6)\n- 14 new farm jobs created\n- Community hubs now district partners (4 coordinators earning $30K/year each)\n\n**Student Outcomes:**\n- Lunch participation rate: +18% (kids choosing to eat school lunch)\n- Plate waste: -31% (kids eating more of their food)\n- Students reporting \"I like school lunch\": +41%\n- Teachers report: improved afternoon focus (anecdotal, study ongoing)\n\n**Community:**\n- 6 schools now have farm visit field trips (educational integration)\n- Student-run school gardens supplying salad greens (curriculum tie-in)\n- Parent engagement at schools with local food: +22% (more involved families)\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Winter sourcing required preserved foods (solved: canning partnership with community center)\n- Some kitchen staff needed training on fresh food prep (solved: paid training program)\n- Transportation logistics complex (ongoing optimization)\n\n**Next Phase:**\n- Expand to 6 more schools (50% of district by year 2)\n- Integrate with nutrition curriculum (farm-to-table education)\n- Develop year-round supply protocols (root vegetables, preserved foods, greenhouse partnerships)\n\nSarah reads this and realizes: **Individual care work \u2192 Family coordination \u2192 Neighborhood networks \u2192 Community hubs \u2192 District policy \u2192 Systemic change.**\n\nThe care economy is becoming institutional infrastructure.\n\n## Governance Mechanics\n\nThe **district layer** is where community experiments scale to policy affecting tens of thousands of people. Here's how it operates:\n\n**District Sovereignty:**\n- Lincoln School District can set food sourcing policies within federal/state nutrition guidelines\n- Elected school board makes policy decisions on behalf of district constituents\n- District can allocate budget to local priorities (food, programs, staff)\n- Must comply with state education law and federal school meal requirements\n\n**Constitutional Constraints:**\n- Must meet federal nutrition standards (USDA requirements)\n- Cannot discriminate in meal access (all students entitled to meals)\n- Subject to state health and safety regulations\n- Must maintain fiscal responsibility and transparency\n- Cannot override family sovereignty (families can opt out of meal program)\n\n**How District Authority Works:**\n\n1. **Policy-Making (elected governance):**\n   - School board is elected by district residents every 3-4 years\n   - Board sets policy direction (local food integration approved here)\n   - Superintendent implements board decisions\n   - Community input through public comment process (Sarah's testimony)\n\n2. **Resource Allocation (public budget):**\n   - District food budget: $2.3 million/year (public funds)\n   - Board decides how to spend: corporate contracts vs. local sourcing\n   - New allocation: $240K/year for hub coordinators + infrastructure\n   - Transparent budgeting (public meetings, published reports)\n\n3. **Institutional Partnerships (scaling community work):**\n   - Community hubs operate independently (community layer)\n   - District contracts with hubs for services (district-community partnership)\n   - Hub coordinators become district partners (professionalized care work)\n   - Mutual accountability (hubs deliver services, district provides resources)\n\n4. **Cross-Neighborhood Coordination (district-wide patterns):**\n   - District sees patterns across all 18 schools\n   - Identifies successful interventions (community hubs work)\n   - Scales what works (food hub model \u2192 district policy)\n   - Resources what individuals/communities can't afford (commercial kitchens, guaranteed contracts)\n\n**Subsidiarity in Action:**\n\n*Why this happens at district layer, not higher or lower:*\n\n- **Not Community Layer:** Multiple communities across district need coordination; too big for single community to address\n- **Not Municipal Layer:** School districts often don't align with city boundaries; district has authority over school food policy\n- **Not State Layer:** Local food sourcing is district decision within state guidelines; no need for state-wide mandate\n\n*What can be decided at district layer:*\n- School meal program sourcing and vendors\n- District budget allocation for food infrastructure\n- Partnerships with community organizations\n- Educational curriculum integration (farm visits, nutrition education)\n- Facility use (schools' kitchens available for community hubs on weekends)\n\n*What cannot be decided at district layer:*\n- Federal nutrition standards (set by USDA)\n- State health regulations (set by state health department)\n- Individual family meal choices (family layer)\n- Municipal zoning for farm stands (municipal layer)\n\n**District Governance Process:**\n\n```\nPattern Recognition (district_elohim aggregates across communities)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Observes 4 successful

advocacy fragmented (individuals complaining, no coordination)\n- Community food work unrecognized (hubs existed informally, without public legitimacy)\n- Care labor of hub coordinators unpaid (mostly women, invisible labor)\n- Local economic potential hidden (no one tracked wealth leaving district)\n- Student food experiences ignored (kids ate what they were served, preferences unknown)\n- Farm economic struggles invisible (small farms failed quietly, no district awareness)\n\n**How the District Layer Makes It Visible:**\n\n1. **Community Care Work Legitimized:**\n   - Hub coordinators (Sarah, Maria, Priya, James) recognized as **district partners**\n   - Previously unpaid care labor \u2192 $30K/year stipends (professionalized)\n   - Community organizing \u2192 institutional infrastructure\n   - Women's coordination work \u2192 public sector employment\n\n2. **Economic Flows Made Transparent:**\n   - Before: $2.3 million/year to Sysco (left district)\n   - After: $690K/year to local farms (stayed in district)\n   - Job creation quantified: 14 new farm jobs in 6 months\n   - Local multiplier effect: every dollar circulates 2-3 times locally\n\n3. **Student Voice Amplified:**\n   - Lunch participation +18% (kids choosing school lunch)\n   - Food waste -31% (kids eating more)\n   - \"I like school lunch\" +41% (student satisfaction)\n   - Kids' preferences informing district food purchasing\n\n4. **Parent Civic Participation Enabled:**\n   - Sarah's testimony shapes policy (parent as civic actor, not just consumer)\n   - 47 parents attend board meeting (organized through elohim networks)\n   - Parent engagement +22% at schools with local food (food as entry point for involvement)\n   - Democracy deepened through participatory governance\n\n5. **Cross-Community Learning Visible:**\n   - 4 independent hubs \u2192 district sees pattern\n   - Successful model documented and made replicable\n   - Other districts can learn from Lincoln's experiment\n   - Knowledge becomes public good\n\n**How Visibility Creates Value:**\n\n1. **Economic Value (direct):**\n   - $690K/year in district (vs. leaving to national corp)\n   - 14 jobs created (local employment)\n   - 4 hub coordinators earning livable stipends ($30K/year)\n   - Farms economically viable (can invest in expansion)\n\n2. **Health Value (long-term):**\n   - Student nutrition improved (more produce, less processed food)\n   - Projected: reduced diet-related illness (long-term cost savings)\n   - Health equity: low-income students eating same quality as affluent students\n   - Community health infrastructure (hubs serve beyond schools)\n\n3. **Educational Value:**\n   - Farm field trips integrated into curriculum (students learn food systems)\n   - School gardens supplying cafeterias (experiential learning)\n   - Student leadership opportunities (teen volunteers in hubs)\n   - Civic education (kids see local democracy in action)\n\n4. **Political Value (democratic capacity):**\n   - Community organizing effective (policy changed through grassroots advocacy)\n   - Parent political efficacy increased (Sarah now knows her voice matters)\n   - District governance responsive (board listens to community testimony)\n   - Democratic participation modeled for next generation\n\n5. **Institutional Value (infrastructure):**\n   - Care economy embedded in public institutions (school district)\n   - Community networks legitimized (hubs as official partners)\n   - Replicable model documented (other districts can adopt)\n   - Public investment in care infrastructure (sets precedent)\n\n**Who Benefits:**\n\n- **Students (12,000):** Better food, nutrition education, democratic modeling\n- **Parents (especially coordinators):** Civic voice, employment, community connection\n- **Farmers (12 local farms):** Economic viability, stable contracts, community relationship\n- **Hub coordinators (4):** Professionalized care work, income, public recognition\n- **Community hubs:** Institutional legitimacy, sustainable funding, expanded capacity\n- **District:** Local economic development, health improvement, democratic engagement\n- **Other districts:** Replicable model for local food integration\n- **Care economy movement:** Proof that public institutions can invest in care infrastructure\n\n## Connections\n\n### Downward from Community Layer\n\nDistrict policy was **seeded** by community experiments:\n\n- **4 community food hubs** proved model viability (community layer)\n- **Community_elohim agents** tracked impact and reported patterns to district\n- **Community leaders (Sarah, Maria, etc.)** brought lived experience to policy advocacy\n- **Community data** provided evidence for district investment\n\nDistrict policy **scales** community success, but **originates** from community action.\n\n### Upward to Municipal Layer\n\nDistrict outcomes inform city-level policy:\n\n**Patterns Flowing Up:**\n- \"School district shifted $690K/year to local farms through community partnerships\"\n- \"Local food integration created 14 jobs in 6 months\"\n- \"Community hub model works across demographics (replicable)\"\n- \"Public investment in care economy infrastructure yields economic + health returns\"\n\n**Municipal Layer Might Respond:**\n- Zoning changes to support urban farming and food hubs\n- Business development grants for local farms\n- Public health department integration with food hubs\n- City procurement policies favor local sourcing (beyond schools)\n\nDistrict demonstrates **proof of concept**, municipality provides **structural support** at city scale.\n\n### Sideways to Other Districts\n\nLincoln's pilot informs regional learning:\n\n**Anonymous Learnings Shared:**\n- \"Local food integration model: implementation guide for school districts\"\n- \"Care economy infrastructure in public institutions: legal and financial frameworks\"\n- \"Community hub partnerships: contract templates and accountability structures\"\n- \"Student nutrition outcomes: documented improvements in lunch participation and food waste reduction\"\n\n**Other Districts Replicate:**\n- Riverside School District (neighboring) adopts similar policy\n- State education department features Lincoln as case study\n- National school lunch reform advocates cite Lincoln data\n\n**Network Effects:**\n- As more districts adopt, regional food system infrastructure strengthens\n- Farms can plan for multi-district contracts (greater stability)\n- Cross-district learning communities form (knowledge sharing)\n\n### Boundary with State Layer\n\nSome aspects require state-level support:\n\n**What District Can Do:**\n- Set local food sourcing goals (30% target)\n- Allocate budget to community hubs\n- Contract with local farms\n- Integrate nutrition education into curriculum\n\n**What Requires State Layer:**\n- Modify federal reimbursement rules (USDA standards)\n- State health regulations for community food handling\n- State funding formulas to support local food infrastructure\n- Statewide farm-to-school programs\n\nDistrict demonstrates **need and model**, state provides **policy framework** and **additional resources**.\n\n### Internal District Governance Evolution\n\nAs the pilot succeeds, governance deepens:\n\n**Year 1:** Pilot program (3 schools)\n**Year 2:** Expansion (9 schools, 50% of district)\n**Year 3:** District-wide (18 schools, 100%)\n\n**Institutional Integration:**\n- Food services director becomes champion (initially skeptical)\n- Curriculum integration (farm visits, nutrition units)\n- Community partnerships normalized (hubs as permanent partners)\n- Budget line item (local food allocation permanent)\n\n**Democratic Participation:**\n- School board elections feature local food as issue\n- Parent engagement sustained (not just one-time testimony)\n- Student leadership in school gardens and food councils\n- Community hubs participate in district planning\n\nDistrict layer governance **matures** from experiment to **embedded infrastructure**.\n\n---\n\n**This scenario demonstrates:**\n- District layer as scaling mechanism for community experiments\n- How community care work becomes institutional infrastructure\n- Public investment in care economy (hub coordinators compensated)\n- Participatory governance (parent testimony shaping policy)\n- Cross-community pattern recognition informing district policy\n- Economic development through local wealth circulation\n- Subsidiarity: District acts where communities can't alone (guaranteed contracts, capital infrastructure)\n- Democratic accountability (elected board, public process, transparent outcomes)\n\n**Next:** Municipality Layer scenario, where district and community patterns inform city-wide policy on food systems, public health, and economic development.\n",
