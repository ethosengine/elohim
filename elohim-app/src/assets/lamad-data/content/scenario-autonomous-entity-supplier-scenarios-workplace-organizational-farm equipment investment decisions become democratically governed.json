  "content": "Scenario: Farm equipment investment decisions become democratically governed\n    Given equipment purchases previously were Tom's sole decision\n    And workers who use equipment daily had no input on purchases\n    When democratic governance includes workers in equipment decisions\n    Then farmworkers evaluate equipment options based on usability and safety\n    And purchases prioritize worker wellbeing alongside productivity\n    And equipment maintenance improves through worker ownership and care\n    And investment decisions reflect users' expertise and long-term thinking\n    And workplace_elohim facilitates democratic equipment planning and budgeting\n",
