  "content": "Scenario: Grappling with fundamental question of governing superintelligence\n    Given agents approaching superintelligence exceed human comprehension\n    And delegates must decide if democratic oversight is possible\n    When I testify about the superintelligence governance challenge\n    Then I honestly state: we don't know if this is solvable\n    And I explain: why comprehension might be fundamental barrier\n    And I present: approaches being researched (amplification, debate, explainability)\n    And I acknowledge: that cryptographic proof might not suffice\n    And I explore: whether capability limits are necessary\n    And I accept: uncertainty about humanity's most important challenge\n    And I demonstrate: intellectual honesty in face of existential questions\n",
