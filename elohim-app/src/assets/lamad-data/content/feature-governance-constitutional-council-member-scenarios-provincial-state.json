Provincial/State-Level Constitutional Council Deliberation for Council Member\n  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system\n  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer\n  I want to deliberate on complex regional appeals and establish precedent\n  So that constitutional interpretation guides multiple communities coherently\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the constitutional_council_member user is registered in the system\n    And the provincial_state governance context is active\n    And Sarah Martinez serves her 4-month term on Regional Constitutional Council\n\n  Scenario: Serving on Regional Council with greater complexity and time\n    Given I was selected for Regional Constitutional Council\n    And this layer handles escalated appeals and novel situations\n    When I begin my 4-month term meeting twice weekly\n    Then I review: cases that couldn't be resolved at community layer\n    And I deliberate: complex constitutional questions affecting region\n    And I create: precedent influencing multiple communities\n    And I work with: citizens from diverse communities across region\n    And I receive: enhanced training for greater responsibility\n    And I am compensated: for significant time commitment\n    And I feel: weight of creating regional constitutional law\n\n  Scenario: Deliberating multi-community coordination case\n    Given an appeal involves agent decisions across several communities\n    And different communities have conflicting local calibrations\n    When our regional council reviews the inter-community conflict\n    Then we evaluate: how subsidiarity applies across boundaries\n    And we examine: if regional coordination is constitutionally required\n    And we consider: if local diversity should be harmonized or preserved\n    And we consult: community leaders about local context\n    And we establish: regional minimums while respecting variation\n    And we create: precedent for multi-layer governance coherence\n    And our judgment: enables communities to coordinate democratically\n\n  Scenario: Reviewing case with significant technical complexity\n    Given appeal involves cryptographic verification questions\n    And I lack technical expertise to understand the details\n    When Dr. Okonkwo provides expert testimony\n    Then she explains: in language I can understand\n    And she shows: what can and cannot be technically verified\n    And she presents: competing expert interpretations\n    And she informs: without advocating for particular outcome\n    And I ask: questions until I understand enough to judge\n    And I weigh: technical information alongside human wisdom\n    And I decide: on constitutional alignment not technical optimization\n    And I honor: the boundary between expertise and judgment\n\n  Scenario: Creating novel constitutional precedent for new situation\n    Given an appeal presents situation never before encountered\n    And existing precedents don't clearly apply\n    When we engage in deep constitutional interpretation\n    Then we examine: fundamental principles and their application\n    And we consider: multiple interpretations and their implications\n    And we consult: technical experts about possibilities\n    And we study: similar cases from other regions for insight\n    And we deliberate: for extended time given novelty and stakes\n    And we craft: new precedent with careful reasoning\n    And we document: our constitutional analysis thoroughly\n    And we create: guidance for future similar cases\n\n  Scenario: Documenting dissenting opinion preserving minority view\n    Given our council reaches majority decision on appeal\n    And I disagree with the majority interpretation\n    When we document the precedent\n    Then my dissenting opinion: is included with full reasoning\n    And I explain: alternative constitutional reading\n    And I articulate: why majority may have missed important considerations\n    And future councils: can reference both majority and dissent\n    And constitutional evolution: can draw on minority wisdom later\n    And my disagreement: is honored as legitimate democratic deliberation\n    And precedent reflects: richness of constitutional debate\n\n  Scenario: Balancing speed and deliberation quality under time pressure\n    Given regional crisis creates many urgent appeals\n    And we must review decisions quickly\n    When we convene emergency sessions for crisis appeals\n    Then we maintain: deliberation quality despite urgency\n    And we evaluate: if emergency protocols were properly invoked\n    And we examine: if crisis justified departures from normal process\n    And we provide: expedited review within 48-72 hours\n    And we avoid: rubber-stamping under pressure\n    And we create: precedent for crisis governance\n    And we ensure: democratic accountability even in emergencies\n\n  Scenario: My judgment influences policy maker legislation\n    Given Senator Ruiz is drafting AI governance legislation\n    And she reviews our regional council precedents for insight\n    When our constitutional reasoning informs her policy\n    Then my citizen judgment: shapes democratic law\n    And my lived experience: enriches legislative wisdom\n    And my constitutional interpretation: guides government integration\n    And sortition governance: and representative democracy work together\n    And I contribute: to democratic governance beyond my council service\n    And my voice: matters in ways I never imagined as nurse\n\n  Scenario: Reviewing systematic bias revealed across community appeals\n    Given researcher identified pattern of biased agent decisions\n    And multiple similar appeals came from affected communities\n    When we treat this as systemic review not individual cases\n    Then we investigate: if protocol implementation has regional problems\n    And we examine: if certain demographics are disadvantaged\n    And we consult: researchers on the pattern data\n    And we may order: regional protocol audit or recalibration\n    And we address: structural injustice not just individual grievances\n    And we demonstrate: constitutional accountability works at scale\n    And we prevent: systemic violations through democratic oversight\n\n  Scenario: Grappling with cultural diversity and constitutional minimums\n    Given appeal involves community with different cultural practices\n    And tension exists between cultural values and constitutional principles\n    When we deliberate on cultural context and universal minimums\n    Then we honor: legitimate cultural diversity\n    And we distinguish: variation from violations of human dignity\n    And we examine: if protocol accommodates cultural specificity\n    And we balance: universal minimums with cultural respect\n    And we avoid: both cultural imperialism and harmful relativism\n    And we create: precedent protecting pluralism within constitutional bounds\n    And we demonstrate: wisdom ordinary citizens bring to complex questions\n\n  Scenario: Contributing to regional policy improvement through recommendations\n    Given we identified gaps in agent protocols through appeals\n    And we documented recommendations for improvement\n    When community leaders and policy makers review our guidance\n    Then protocol developers: implement our suggested enhancements\n    And communities: consider our calibration recommendations\n    And policy makers: craft legislation addressing the gaps\n    And our constitutional interpretation: drives continuous improvement\n    And democratic feedback loop: connects citizen oversight to systemic learning\n    And my service: makes governance better for region\n",
