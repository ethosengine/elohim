  "content": "Scenario: Family care boundaries prevent burnout and exploitation\n    Given Robert carries substantial family care burden\n    And family care can become exploitative even with good intentions\n    When family_elohim monitors care burden\n    Then it should flag when Robert's care contributions exceed sustainable levels\n    And recognize if siblings are not contributing equitably\n    And surface if parents' needs are overwhelming family capacity\n    And prompt discussion when external support is needed\n    And protect Robert from being expected to handle everything\n    And support family in recognizing when professional care is appropriate\n    And ensure family care operates on reciprocity, not exploitation\n",
