  "content": "Scenario: Documenting dissenting opinion preserving minority view\n    Given our council reaches majority decision on appeal\n    And I disagree with the majority interpretation\n    When we document the precedent\n    Then my dissenting opinion: is included with full reasoning\n    And I explain: alternative constitutional reading\n    And I articulate: why majority may have missed important considerations\n    And future councils: can reference both majority and dissent\n    And constitutional evolution: can draw on minority wisdom later\n    And my disagreement: is honored as legitimate democratic deliberation\n    And precedent reflects: richness of constitutional debate\n",
