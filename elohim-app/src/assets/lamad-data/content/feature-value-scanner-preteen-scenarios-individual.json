Individual Layer Value Recognition for Preteen\n  As a preteen (ages 11-13) in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want autonomy to manage real household responsibilities with dignity\n  So that my substantial care contributions are recognized and I develop capability under real constraints\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the preteen user \"Marcus\" is registered in the system\n    And Marcus is 12 years old\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Marcus's personal_agent is configured for real responsibility support\n    And Marcus manages $75 weekly grocery budget for himself and his sister Keisha\n    And parental oversight is calibrated for substantial autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Preteen exercises genuine autonomy in real economic decisions\n    Given Marcus has $75 budget for weekly groceries\n    And the budget is not hypothetical but actual family resource constraint\n    When Marcus uses the Value Scanner to plan weekly shopping\n    Then he should have full autonomy within budget boundaries\n    And his personal_agent should provide adult-level decision support\n    And the interface should treat him as capable, not as a child\n    And his choices should have real consequences for family survival\n    And the system should recognize he's not practicing but performing\n    And autonomy should be genuine, not simulated learning\n\n  Scenario: Managing real scarcity without shame or stigma\n    Given Marcus's family has limited economic resources\n    And $75/week must feed two people adequately\n    When Marcus shops under tight budget constraints\n    Then the personal_agent should help him maximize value with dignity\n    And budget tools should be presented as capability support, not poverty markers\n    And the system should never make him feel ashamed of constraints\n    And resourcefulness should be framed as valuable skill, not deprivation\n    And his capability to manage scarcity should be recognized as sophisticated\n    And no patronizing language about \"limited budgets\" should be used\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent provides collegial support for complex adult work\n    Given Marcus is performing work that adults get paid to do\n    And he needs sophisticated planning and analysis tools\n    When Marcus's personal_agent interacts with him\n    Then the relationship should be almost collegial\n    And the agent should provide information, analysis, and planning support\n    And the agent should say \"You've kept nutrition above 90% for three weeks\u2014excellent stewardship\"\n    And emotional encouragement should acknowledge real difficulty of his work\n    And the agent should serve as genuine tool for real work\n    And the tone should respect his capability while supporting his needs\n\n  Scenario: Development of conscious values and identity around care\n    Given Marcus is forming conscious values and identity\n    And he is developing abstract thinking capacity\n    When Marcus makes repeated care decisions over time\n    Then he should be developing identity as capable caregiver\n    And his values around family responsibility should be consciously forming\n    And the system should support healthy identity development\n    And he should see himself as person who takes care of his family\n    And care economy principles should shape his developing worldview\n    And his self-concept should be as contributor, not burden\n\n  Scenario: Planning across time with sophisticated coordination tools\n    Given Marcus plans weekly meals for himself and Keisha\n    And he must coordinate ingredients across multiple meals\n    When Marcus uses planning features\n    Then he should have access to meal planning with nutritional analysis\n    And budget tracking should project across weeks\n    And shopping list optimization should be available\n    And inventory management should prevent waste\n    And multi-store price comparison should support best value finding\n    And planning tools should be professional-grade but accessible\n\n  Scenario: Nutrition management with safety net for critical thresholds\n    Given Marcus is responsible for his and Keisha's nutrition\n    And inadequate nutrition has serious consequences\n    When Marcus makes food choices over time\n    Then the personal_agent should track nutrition across meals and weeks\n    And the system should watch for nutrition falling below safe levels\n    And if nutrition drops below critical thresholds, adult intervention should be triggered\n    And Marcus should be supported in meeting nutritional needs\n    And the agent should proactively suggest nutritious affordable options\n    And safety nets should protect without undermining autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Recognition of substantial care labor as economically valuable\n    Given Marcus performs household management work\n    And similar work by adults would be compensated\n    When Marcus completes weekly shopping and meal planning\n    Then his care contributions should be valued at realistic economic rates\n    And care tokens should reflect genuine value of his work\n    And the system should make explicit that his labor is valuable\n    And recognition should communicate that he's doing skilled work\n    And his contributions should qualify family for community resources\n    And his stewardship should be evidence of capability, not exploitation\n\n  Scenario: Developmentally appropriate autonomy with emergency assistance\n    Given Marcus has substantial independence\n    And he is still only 12 years old\n    When Marcus uses the Value Scanner\n    Then he should have freedom to make real decisions\n    And emergency assistance options should be clearly visible\n    And the personal_agent should watch for stress exceeding healthy bounds\n    And crisis situations should trigger connection to adult support\n    And intervention should preserve his dignity and autonomy\n    And the goal should be supporting capability, not taking over\n\n  Scenario: Privacy protection for sensitive household circumstances\n    Given Marcus's household situation must be protected\n    And his family's economic constraints are private information\n    When Marcus's care contributions are tracked\n    Then his specific circumstances must not be broadcast\n    And data about shopping patterns must remain confidential\n    And community resource coordination should use anonymized data\n    And his privacy should be protected even while receiving support\n    And no stigmatizing exposure of family situation should occur\n\n  Scenario: Building abstract thinking through real economic complexity\n    Given Marcus is developing abstract thinking capacity\n    And he's managing genuinely complex resource coordination\n    When Marcus plans across time and context\n    Then he should be building sophisticated cognitive capabilities\n    And the personal_agent should support abstract planning\n    And he should understand opportunity costs through real experience\n    And complex systems thinking should develop through practice\n    And his cognitive development should be supported by real challenges\n    And abstract economic concepts should be learned through application\n\n  Scenario: Right to disconnect and data sovereignty maintained\n    Given Marcus uses the system for critical household functions\n    And constitutional constraints apply at all governance layers\n    When Marcus or his family choose to disconnect\n    Then the system must honor disconnection immediately\n    And alternative methods for household management must remain viable\n    And no dependency should be created that makes disconnection harmful\n    And data sovereignty must be preserved\n    And Marcus's right to not participate must be absolute\n",
