Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities\n  As a person with disabilities participating in neighborhood life\n  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer\n  I want to contribute to and benefit from neighborhood care economy with full accessibility\n  So that I can be a full neighbor whose presence improves the neighborhood for everyone\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the person_with_disabilities user \"Alex\" is registered in the system\n    And Alex lives in a neighborhood with various accessibility barriers\n    And Alex uses a wheelchair for mobility\n    And the neighborhood governance context is active\n    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy\n    And Alex participates in neighborhood mutual aid networks\n\n  Scenario: Alex's accessibility advocacy improves neighborhood for everyone\n    Given Alex documents accessibility barriers in the neighborhood\n    And improved accessibility benefits elderly residents, parents with strollers, delivery workers\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks Alex's advocacy contributions\n    Then Alex's work identifying barriers should accumulate care tokens\n    And advocacy for curb cuts, accessible entrances, better lighting benefits whole neighborhood\n    And Alex's contributions should be recognized as care work for community\n    And the protocol should make visible how disability advocacy serves everyone\n    And Alex should be seen as neighborhood improver, not complainer\n    And care economy should value Alex's expertise about accessibility\n    And neighborhood should understand Alex's work as gift to all residents\n\n  Scenario: Documenting accessibility barriers for collective action\n    Given the neighborhood has many accessibility barriers\n    And individual complaints often go unaddressed\n    When Alex uses the system to document barriers\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should collect systematic barrier data\n    And it should identify patterns across multiple residents' reports\n    And documentation should support collective advocacy\n    And data should enable organized demands for improvements\n    And Alex's expertise should strengthen neighborhood organizing\n    And the protocol should facilitate collective power-building\n    And systematic change should become possible through organized documentation\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood mutual aid networks include Alex as full participant\n    Given Alex participates in neighborhood mutual aid\n    And Alex both gives and receives support\n    When neighborhood care flows are tracked\n    Then Alex should be recognized as mutual aid contributor\n    And Alex provides support to neighbors (advice, connection, skills)\n    And Alex receives support from neighbors (physical assistance, rides, help)\n    And reciprocity should be visible and valued\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should track care flows in multiple directions\n    And Alex should experience genuine mutuality, not charity\n    And interdependence should be normalized as neighborhood practice\n\n  Scenario: Accessible neighborhood events enable Alex's participation\n    Given neighborhood events are often inaccessible\n    And inaccessibility equals exclusion from community\n    When neighborhood events are planned\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should prompt organizers about accessibility\n    And it should provide checklist of access considerations\n    And Alex should be consulted as accessibility expert\n    And venues should be verified for wheelchair access, sensory accommodations\n    And accessible events should become neighborhood norm\n    And Alex should be able to participate fully in neighborhood life\n    And inclusion should be proactive, not reactive\n\n  Scenario: Alex's presence shifts neighborhood culture toward inclusion\n    Given neighborhoods often lack disability awareness\n    And Alex's participation educates neighbors about disability\n    When Alex engages in neighborhood activities\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should track cultural shifts toward inclusion\n    And neighbors should learn about accessibility through relationship with Alex\n    And disability should become normalized in neighborhood culture\n    And Alex's expertise should be sought and valued\n    And the neighborhood should become more accessible over time\n    And cultural transformation should be recognized as Alex's contribution\n    And Alex's care work includes disability education through presence\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood resources coordinated to support Alex's participation\n    Given Alex may need specific support to participate in neighborhood activities\n    And neighborhood has resources that could help\n    When Alex wants to engage in neighborhood events or projects\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate needed support\n    And neighbors might provide transportation, physical assistance, or other help\n    And support should be reciprocal within mutual aid framework\n    And Alex should not experience this as charity or burden\n    And resource coordination should enable participation\n    And the protocol should facilitate Alex's full neighborhood engagement\n    And access barriers should be solved collectively, not individually\n\n  Scenario: Snow removal and sidewalk maintenance advocacy\n    Given Alex uses a wheelchair and inaccessible sidewalks trap Alex at home\n    And snow removal is often inadequate\n    When winter weather creates accessibility barriers\n    Then Alex should be able to document sidewalk problems systematically\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate snow removal advocacy\n    And Alex's mobility needs should be recognized as legitimate priority\n    And neighbors should understand that sidewalk access is essential infrastructure\n    And collective action should demand better municipal services\n    And Alex's advocacy should improve conditions for all residents\n    And the neighborhood should support Alex's right to mobility\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood care tokens value Alex's substantial contributions\n    Given Alex contributes significantly to neighborhood care economy\n    And traditional metrics don't capture accessibility advocacy value\n    When neighborhood care tokens are calculated\n    Then Alex's barrier documentation should accumulate tokens\n    And Alex's mutual aid participation should be valued appropriately\n    And Alex's disability expertise shared with neighbors should count\n    And Alex's organizing work should generate care economy standing\n    And care tokens should position Alex as neighborhood contributor\n    And Alex should be able to access neighborhood resources based on contributions\n    And the protocol should make Alex's neighborhood value undeniable\n\n  Scenario: Accessible communication ensures Alex can participate in neighborhood decisions\n    Given neighborhood uses various communication methods\n    And some methods may exclude Alex\n    When neighborhood decisions are made\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should ensure accessible communication\n    And neighborhood should use multiple formats (digital, physical, verbal)\n    And Alex should have equal access to all neighborhood information\n    And voting and input processes should be accessible\n    And Alex's voice should be included in neighborhood governance\n    And accessibility should be default, not accommodation\n    And the protocol should ensure Alex's full participation\n\n  Scenario: Alex mentors other disabled neighbors in advocacy\n    Given other disabled people live in the neighborhood\n    And many lack confidence in self-advocacy\n    When Alex supports other disabled neighbors\n    Then this peer mentoring should be recognized as care work\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should track Alex's support to disabled community\n    And Alex's disability expertise benefits other residents significantly\n    And peer support should accumulate care tokens appropriately\n    And Alex's leadership in disability community should be valued\n    And mentoring should be seen as sophisticated care labor\n    And the protocol should recognize Alex's role building disability solidarity\n\n  Scenario: Emergency preparedness includes disability considerations\n    Given emergencies affect disabled people disproportionately\n    And Alex has specific emergency needs\n    When the neighborhood plans for emergencies\n    Then Alex should be included in emergency planning\n    And neighborhood should know about residents with access needs\n    And evacuation plans should accommodate wheelchair users\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate disability-inclusive preparedness\n    And Alex's expertise should shape neighborhood emergency protocols\n    And disabled neighbors should be protected, not forgotten\n    And inclusive planning should reduce vulnerability for all residents\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood businesses learn accessibility from Alex\n    Given local businesses often lack accessibility awareness\n    And Alex's feedback could improve business accessibility\n    When Alex interacts with neighborhood businesses\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate Alex providing accessibility feedback\n    And businesses should receive Alex's expertise as valuable service\n    And improvements should be tracked and celebrated\n    And Alex should be compensated for consultation when appropriate\n    And accessible businesses benefit from disability community patronage\n    And the neighborhood should become more accessible through Alex's guidance\n    And Alex's care work includes making local economy accessible\n\n  Scenario: Protecting Alex from neighborhood discrimination\n    Given Alex may face discrimination or harassment from neighbors\n    And ableism is pervasive in society\n    When discrimination occurs\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should help Alex document incidents\n    And it should connect Alex to legal resources and advocacy support\n    And it should facilitate collective response from supportive neighbors\n    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves\n    And the protocol should recognize that neighborhoods can be hostile\n    And safety resources should be readily available\n    And Alex's right to live without discrimination should be defended\n",
