  "content": "Scenario: Household governance as necessary autocracy with age-appropriate child input\n    Given Maria is the only adult making every household decision\n    And children need appropriate voice based on developmental stage\n    When household decisions are made\n    Then the household_elohim should support Maria's final authority\n    And it should help her gather age-appropriate input from children\n    And her 14-year-old should have more voice than younger children\n    And her 6-year-old should have simple choices within boundaries\n    And household governance should be efficient while respecting all members\n    And Maria should maintain control without becoming authoritarian\n",
