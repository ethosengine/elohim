Ecological Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities\n  As a person with disabilities engaging with ecological and environmental systems\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want disability justice and ecological justice recognized as interconnected\n  So that both movements strengthen each other toward interdependent flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the person_with_disabilities user \"Alex\" is registered in the system\n    And Alex understands interdependence deeply through disability experience\n    And Alex participates in environmental justice organizing\n    And the ecological governance context is active\n    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates ecological care economy\n    And disability justice and environmental justice share core principles\n\n  Scenario: Disability justice insights inform ecological care economy\n    Given disability justice recognizes that no one is truly independent\n    And disabled people understand interdependence as lived reality\n    When the bioregional_elohim models ecological relationships\n    Then disability justice principles should inform ecological thinking\n    And Alex's understanding of mutual aid should shape environmental approaches\n    And recognition of diverse ways of being should extend to ecological diversity\n    And interdependence should be celebrated, not denied\n    And the protocol should learn from disability community wisdom\n    And ecological systems should embody values disability justice teaches\n    And Alex's expertise about interdependence should be valued\n\n  Scenario: Environmental accessibility enables disabled people's participation\n    Given natural spaces are often inaccessible to disabled people\n    And inaccessibility excludes disabled people from environmental connection\n    When ecological spaces and programs are designed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should advocate for environmental accessibility\n    And trails, parks, gardens should be wheelchair accessible\n    And sensory accommodations should be considered\n    And Alex should be able to participate in environmental care work\n    And exclusion from nature compounds disability injustice\n    And the protocol should recognize that accessibility is environmental justice\n    And disabled people's right to nature should be protected\n\n  Scenario: Climate crisis disproportionately harms disabled people\n    Given disabled people are especially vulnerable to climate impacts\n    And emergency systems often fail disabled people\n    When climate adaptation is planned\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should center disabled people in climate planning\n    And Alex's perspective should inform climate justice strategies\n    And emergency preparedness should account for disability needs\n    And climate solutions should be accessible to disabled people\n    And the protocol should recognize disability as environmental justice issue\n    And Alex's expertise about vulnerability should guide climate work\n    And resilience planning should protect most vulnerable community members\n\n  Scenario: Connecting disability rights to environmental justice organizing\n    Given both movements challenge systems that devalue certain lives\n    And both require recognizing interdependence and collective care\n    When Alex participates in environmental organizing\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should facilitate cross-movement solidarity\n    And it should help Alex build bridges between disability and environmental movements\n    And it should make visible shared principles and goals\n    And coalition-building should be supported and valued\n    And Alex's work connecting movements should accumulate care tokens\n    And the protocol should recognize that these justices are interconnected\n    And Alex's bridge-building strengthens both movements\n\n  Scenario: Sustainable living adapted for disability access\n    Given sustainable practices are often designed without disability consideration\n    And inaccessible sustainability excludes disabled people\n    When sustainable living practices are promoted\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should ensure practices are disability-accessible\n    And composting, gardening, conservation should be adaptable for various capabilities\n    And Alex should be able to participate in ecological practices\n    And sustainable living should work for diverse bodies and minds\n    And the protocol should advocate for inclusive environmental practices\n    And disability expertise should improve sustainability design\n    And Alex's participation should be welcomed and supported\n\n  Scenario: Valuing diverse ways of being extends to all life\n    Given disability justice rejects hierarchy of human worth\n    And this principle extends to ecological relationships\n    When the bioregional_elohim represents ecological values\n    Then it should embody recognition of intrinsic worth across difference\n    And diversity should be valued, not just tolerated\n    And interdependence should be centered as strength\n    And disability justice frameworks should inform ecological ethics\n    And Alex's understanding of diversity as value should shape environmental thinking\n    And the protocol should learn from disability community wisdom\n    And respect for difference should extend from people to ecosystems\n\n  Scenario: Environmental toxins and disability intersection\n    Given environmental pollution causes and exacerbates disabilities\n    And disabled people are particularly vulnerable to environmental toxins\n    When environmental health is addressed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize disability-environment connections\n    And it should track how environmental factors affect disabled people\n    And Alex's experience should inform environmental health advocacy\n    And environmental justice should include preventing disability from toxins\n    And the protocol should connect environmental and disability health\n    And Alex's advocacy should strengthen environmental health protections\n    And prevention of environmentally-caused disability should be prioritized\n\n  Scenario: Mutual aid practices from disability community inform ecological resilience\n    Given disabled people have deep expertise in mutual aid\n    And ecological resilience requires community cooperation\n    When the bioregional_elohim models community resilience\n    Then it should learn from disability community mutual aid practices\n    And Alex's experience with peer support should inform ecological organizing\n    And disability community's interdependence should model ecological relationships\n    And the protocol should recognize disability community as resilience experts\n    And mutual aid frameworks should be applied to ecological challenges\n    And Alex's knowledge should strengthen bioregional resilience\n    And disability justice practices should inform ecological care economy\n\n  Scenario: Access to healthy food as disability and environmental justice\n    Given food systems often fail disabled people and harm environment\n    And Alex navigates both food access barriers and ecological concerns\n    When food systems are reformed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should connect food justice to disability access\n    And sustainable food should be accessible to disabled people\n    And Alex should be able to participate in local food systems\n    And accessibility should be integrated into food justice work\n    And the protocol should recognize food as both disability and ecological issue\n    And Alex's perspective should inform food system design\n    And local food networks should include disabled people\n\n  Scenario: Disability community's innovation benefits ecological adaptation\n    Given disabled people are constant innovators adapting to inaccessible world\n    And innovation capacity is essential for climate adaptation\n    When ecological challenges require creative solutions\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize disabled people as expert innovators\n    And Alex's adaptive problem-solving should be valued\n    And disability community's creativity should inform climate adaptation\n    And the protocol should learn from how disabled people solve access problems\n    And innovation from disability should strengthen ecological resilience\n    And Alex's adaptive expertise should contribute to ecological solutions\n    And disability innovation should be recognized as community resource\n\n  Scenario: Transportation justice connects disability and environmental advocacy\n    Given accessible public transit reduces both carbon emissions and disability barriers\n    And transportation is both disability rights and environmental issue\n    When transportation systems are reformed\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should advocate for accessible sustainable transit\n    And Alex's transit needs should align with environmental goals\n    And accessible transit should be framed as climate solution\n    And disability advocates and environmentalists should work together\n    And the protocol should facilitate transportation justice coalitions\n    And Alex's advocacy for accessible transit serves both causes\n    And sustainable transportation must include disability access\n\n  Scenario: Bioregional belonging includes disabled people as full participants\n    Given disabled people are often excluded from community belonging\n    And bioregional identity requires full inclusion of all residents\n    When bioregional community is defined\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should include disabled people as essential members\n    And Alex should be welcomed as full bioregional participant\n    And disability should be recognized as part of human diversity in ecosystem\n    And bioregional care economy should serve disabled members\n    And Alex's contributions should be valued within bioregional context\n    And the protocol should embody that everyone belongs to place\n    And disabled people's relationship to land and ecosystem should be honored\n\n  Scenario: Intergenerational ecological wisdom includes disability experience\n    Given disabled elders hold knowledge about adaptation and resilience\n    And disability experience across generations teaches interdependence\n    When ecological knowledge is preserved and transmitted\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should include disability experience in wisdom traditions\n    And Alex should be recognized as holder of valuable knowledge\n    And disability wisdom should be passed to future generations\n    And ecological teaching should include disability justice principles\n    And the protocol should honor disability experience as ecological knowledge\n    And Alex's understanding of interdependence should be preserved\n    And intergenerational learning should include disability community wisdom\n",
