  "content": "Scenario: Teen participates in neighborhood care patterns as full member\n    Given Jasmine's neighborhood has established care economy practices\n    And she has accumulated care contributions across contexts\n    When Jasmine engages neighborhood-level activities\n    Then she should be recognized as a full participant, not a future member\n    And her care contributions should aggregate with neighbors' contributions\n    And she should have access to neighborhood collective resources\n    And the neighborhood_elohim should recognize her as a constitutional participant\n    And her voice should matter in neighborhood decisions\n    And she should experience being a valued member of her neighborhood community\n",
