  "content": "Scenario: Multi-store comparison for budget optimization\n    Given Aisha's limited budget requires strategic shopping\n    And different stores offer different value propositions\n    When Aisha compares shopping options\n    Then the personal_agent should analyze prices across stores\n    And it should consider transportation costs in calculations\n    And it should identify where spending more saves money long-term\n    And recommendations should optimize total value, not just price\n    And the system should help her find efficiency frontiers\n    And decision support should build financial literacy\n",
