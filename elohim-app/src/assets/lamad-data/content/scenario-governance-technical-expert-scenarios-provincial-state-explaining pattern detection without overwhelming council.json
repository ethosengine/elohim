  "content": "Scenario: Explaining pattern detection without overwhelming council\n    Given complex machine learning algorithm detected Marcus's risk pattern\n    And council needs to understand how this works\n    When I explain pattern recognition in accessible terms\n    Then I describe: what data the agent analyzed\n    And I clarify: how patterns are detected across multiple factors\n    And I explain: what makes this pattern concerning vs normal variation\n    And I provide: counterfactuals showing what would change the outcome\n    And I avoid: technical details that don't serve constitutional judgment\n    And I ensure: council grasps enough to evaluate constitutional alignment\n    And I respect: that they don't need to be machine learning experts\n",
