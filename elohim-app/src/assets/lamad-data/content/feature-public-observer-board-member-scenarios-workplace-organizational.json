Employment and Economic Development Governance for Board Member\n  As a board member serving on employment, pension, or economic development board in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the workplace organizational functional layer\n  I want independent analysis of labor, employment, and economic development decisions\n  So that I can balance fiduciary duties with community and worker interests despite limited expertise\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the board_member user is registered in the system\n    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active\n    And I am a volunteer serving on pension board, public employment board, or economic development commission\n\n  Scenario: Pension board member evaluates investment strategy balancing returns and values\n    Given pension fund considers divesting from fossil fuel investments\n    And staff analysis emphasizes fiduciary duty and projected investment returns\n    And some beneficiaries advocate for climate-conscious investing\n    When the board member requests Observer independent analysis\n    Then they receive comparison of fossil fuel versus clean energy investment performance\n    And see examples from peer pension funds that divested with outcome data\n    And access analysis of climate risk to long-term portfolio value\n    And understand fiduciary duty in context of environmental and social factors\n    And independent analysis helps board balance competing considerations\n\n  Scenario: Economic development board member learns accessible expertise on incentive packages\n    Given business proposes expansion with request for $5M in tax incentives\n    And staff recommendation supports incentives emphasizing job creation promises\n    And board member has no economic development expertise but must vote responsibly\n    When the board member uses Observer accessible expertise\n    Then they receive plain-language explanation of incentive types and impacts\n    And see cost-benefit analysis comparing incentive cost to projected tax revenue\n    And access track record of business's job creation in other locations\n    And get key questions to ask about job quality, accountability, and alternatives\n    And accessible expertise enables informed judgment on incentive proposal\n\n  Scenario: Employment board member tracks implementation of living wage policy\n    Given board approved living wage requirement for city contractors two years ago\n    And staff reports successful implementation and compliance\n    And community advocates report ongoing wage violations by contractors\n    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking\n    Then they see contractor wage data showing compliance rates over time\n    And discover enforcement gaps allowing violations to persist\n    And find workers at some contractors still earning below living wage\n    And access comparison to peer cities with stronger enforcement mechanisms\n    And impact tracking reveals gap between policy adoption and actual outcomes\n\n  Scenario: Economic development board member evaluates community benefits agreement\n    Given board considers approving development incentives with community benefits terms\n    And developer proposes hiring commitments, affordable housing, and public space\n    And board wants to understand if benefits are meaningful and enforceable\n    When the board member requests Observer community benefits analysis\n    Then they receive assessment of whether proposed benefits serve community needs\n    And see track record of similar agreements in other jurisdictions\n    And discover many community benefits agreements not enforced or delivered\n    And access specific enforcement mechanisms that make agreements effective\n    And independent analysis helps board negotiate stronger accountability\n\n  Scenario: Pension board member understands worker and community concerns on investment\n    Given pension fund invests in companies with controversial labor practices\n    And beneficiaries and community members raise concerns at board meeting\n    And board wants to understand stakeholder perspectives beyond who testified\n    When the board member seeks community accountability data from Observer\n    Then they receive survey data from pension beneficiaries on investment priorities\n    And see worker concerns about fund investments in companies with poor labor records\n    And access analysis of investment alignment with beneficiary values\n    And understand community impacts of fund investment decisions\n    And community accountability helps board consider stakeholder interests\n\n  Scenario: Economic development board member detects conflicts in incentive recommendation\n    Given staff recommends tax incentives for company relocating to municipality\n    And presentation emphasizes economic benefits and competitive pressure\n    And board will vote on multi-year incentive package at next meeting\n    When the board member uses Observer capture protection analysis\n    Then they discover company executives donated to city officials who appoint board\n    And see consultant hired to evaluate deal previously worked for the company\n    And find incentive terms more generous than peer municipalities offered similar companies\n    And access independent economic analysis showing marginal public benefit\n    And capture protection makes conflicts of interest and manipulation visible\n\n  Scenario: Employment board member evaluates public sector labor contract proposal\n    Given board negotiates collective bargaining agreement with public employees union\n    And city staff emphasizes budget constraints and fiscal sustainability\n    And board wants to balance responsible budgeting with fair compensation\n    When the board member requests Observer labor relations analysis\n    Then they receive comparison of proposed wages to regional public sector market\n    And see employee turnover and vacancy data showing retention challenges\n    And access analysis of contract cost impact on city budget over time\n    And get examples of creative solutions from peer jurisdictions' negotiations\n    And accessible expertise helps board negotiate effectively and fairly\n\n  Scenario: Economic development board member tracks promised jobs from past incentives\n    Given board previously approved incentive packages for business attraction\n    And businesses promised specific job creation targets as incentive condition\n    And board wants to know if incentives produced promised economic benefits\n    When the board member uses Observer accountability tracking\n    Then they see actual job creation versus promises for past incentive deals\n    And discover many businesses created fewer jobs than committed\n    And find weak enforcement mechanisms allowing businesses to keep incentives despite failures\n    And access fiscal impact analysis showing poor return on incentive investment\n    And accountability tracking reveals incentive outcomes diverged from projections\n\n  Scenario: Pension board member prepares for decision on emerging market investments\n    Given investment staff recommends increasing allocation to emerging markets\n    And recommendation includes complex analysis of risk-adjusted returns\n    And board member wants to make informed fiduciary decision but lacks investment expertise\n    When the board member uses Observer decision support\n    Then they receive executive summary of emerging market investment considerations\n    And see performance and volatility data from peer pension funds' allocations\n    And access key questions to ask investment staff about risk management\n    And understand how proposed allocation fits pension fund's overall strategy\n    And accessible expertise enables informed fiduciary judgment\n\n  Scenario: Economic development board member evaluates workforce development program\n    Given board considers funding proposal for job training program\n    And program providers present enrollment projections and success stories\n    And board wants evidence that program will effectively serve unemployed workers\n    When the board member requests Observer workforce program analysis\n    Then they receive outcome data from similar programs including job placement and wages\n    And see analysis of whether program serves populations with greatest need\n    And discover some training programs have poor employment outcomes despite good marketing\n    And access best practices from effective workforce development initiatives\n    And evidence-based analysis helps board invest in programs that actually work\n",
