  "content": "Scenario: Building relationships with neighbors despite stigma about circumstances\n    Given I am living in transitional housing or housing that's visibly \"for\" vulnerable people\n    And I worry about neighborhood stigma and judgment\n    When I interact with neighbors\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me navigate neighborhood relationships\n    And provides strategies for building connections authentically\n    And validates that I am valuable neighbor regardless of circumstances\n    And helps me decide what to disclose about my situation\n    And supports me in resisting internalized shame\n    And my personal_agent coaches me through neighbor interactions\n    And recognizes that building community while vulnerable takes courage\n    And celebrates positive neighbor connections\n",
