"@epic:value_scanner\n@user_type:person_with_disabilities\n@governance_layer:family\n@related_users:adult,parent,sibling,grandparent,elderly\n@related_layers:individual,household,neighborhood,community\n@elohim_agents:personal_agent,family_elohim\n\nFeature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities\n  As a person with disabilities participating in family relationships\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want my autonomy respected and my contributions recognized within family\n  So that I can engage as a full adult family member, not as dependent child or burden\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the person_with_disabilities user \"Alex\" is registered in the system\n    And Alex is 35 years old with cerebral palsy\n    And Alex has family relationships including parents and siblings\n    And Alex lives independently but maintains connection to family\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim coordinates family care economy\n    And family relationships involve complex dynamics around disability\n\n  Scenario: Alex participates in family governance as full adult member\n    Given Alex is an adult family member\n    And some family might still treat Alex as dependent child\n    When family decisions are made\n    Then Alex should have equal voice to other adult family members\n    And Alex's autonomy should be respected by the family_elohim\n    And Alex's opinions should carry weight appropriate to an adult\n    And infantilization patterns should be identified and countered\n    And the system should structure Alex as competent adult\n    And family should be prompted to respect Alex's sovereignty\n    And Alex's full adulthood should be systematically affirmed\n\n  Scenario: Reciprocal care flows challenge narrative of one-directional dependence\n    Given family relationships often assume disabled people only receive care\n    And Alex actually provides substantial care to family\n    When the family_elohim tracks care contributions\n    Then Alex's care work for family should be made visible\n    And Alex provides emotional support, advice, practical help to family members\n    And care should be recognized as flowing in multiple directions\n    And the narrative that Alex only takes should be countered with data\n    And family should see Alex as care contributor, not just recipient\n    And reciprocity should be made undeniable through quantification\n    And cultural assumptions should be challenged by visible reality\n\n  Scenario: Family support coordinated without undermining Alex's independence\n    Given Alex sometimes needs support from family members\n    And family might conflate providing support with having authority\n    When family provides assistance to Alex\n    Then support should flow with full respect for Alex's autonomy\n    And family should provide help Alex requests, not help they think Alex needs\n    And Alex should maintain decision-making authority\n    And the family_elohim should structure relationships to protect Alex's agency\n    And offering help should never imply Alex is incapable\n    And interdependence should be normalized, not pathologized\n    And family support should strengthen, not undermine, Alex's independence\n\n  Scenario: Alex's disability expertise recognized as valuable family knowledge\n    Given Alex has deep expertise about disability, accessibility, and ableism\n    And this knowledge benefits entire family\n    When family engages with disability-related topics\n    Then Alex should be recognized as the family expert\n    And family should seek Alex's guidance on accessibility matters\n    And Alex's advocacy work should be valued as contribution\n    And Alex's perspective should shape family understanding\n    And the family_elohim should position Alex as knowledge source\n    And Alex's disability experience should be treated as expertise, not deficit\n    And family should learn from Alex, not pity Alex\n\n  Scenario: Family boundaries protect Alex from ableist assumptions\n    Given family members might have internalized ableist beliefs\n    And some might make assumptions about Alex's quality of life or capabilities\n    When family interactions occur\n    Then the family_elohim should help Alex maintain boundaries\n    And it should support Alex in responding to ableist comments\n    And it should document patterns of disrespect or boundary violations\n    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves from family ableism\n    And the system should recognize that family can be source of harm\n    And Alex's right to distance from harmful family dynamics should be supported\n    And protection should be available even within family relationships\n\n  Scenario: Family gatherings consider accessibility proactively\n    Given family events often occur in inaccessible spaces\n    And accessibility is frequently an afterthought\n    When family gatherings are planned\n    Then the family_elohim should prompt organizers to consider accessibility\n    And it should provide Alex tools to communicate access needs\n    And venue accessibility should be verified before events\n    And Alex should not have to repeatedly advocate for basic inclusion\n    And family should understand that inaccessibility equals exclusion\n    And accessible planning should become family norm\n    And Alex should be able to participate fully in family life\n\n  Scenario: Alex's life choices respected by family without ableist judgment\n    Given Alex makes life choices that family might not understand\n    And ableism might lead family to question Alex's decisions\n    When Alex makes choices about work, living situation, relationships, etc.\n    Then family should respect Alex's choices as they would any adult's\n    And the family_elohim should affirm Alex's right to self-determination\n    And disability should not be treated as reason to override Alex's autonomy\n    And Alex should not have to justify choices more than non-disabled siblings\n    And the protocol should protect Alex from family paternalism\n    And Alex's sovereignty should be structurally defended\n    And family should be prompted to examine their ableist assumptions\n\n  Scenario: Family care token flows reflect Alex's substantial contributions\n    Given Alex contributes significantly to family care economy\n    And traditional family roles often render disabled people's contributions invisible\n    When family care tokens are calculated\n    Then Alex's emotional labor should accumulate tokens appropriately\n    And Alex's advocacy improving accessibility benefits whole family\n    And Alex's peer support to other disabled family members should be valued\n    And care tokens should flow to Alex for contributions, not just from Alex as recipient\n    And family economics should recognize Alex's care work explicitly\n    And the data should challenge family narratives of Alex as burden\n    And Alex's economic standing within family should reflect actual contributions\n\n  Scenario: Family communication adapted for Alex's accessibility needs\n    Given family uses various communication methods\n    And some methods may not be accessible to Alex\n    When family communicates\n    Then the family_elohim should ensure Alex can participate fully\n    And family should use accessible communication formats\n    And Alex should not be excluded by inaccessible technology choices\n    And family should be prompted to accommodate Alex's needs\n    And accessibility should be automatic, not requested each time\n    And Alex should have equal access to all family communication\n    And the system should reduce Alex's communication barriers\n\n  Scenario: Navigating family history of medical trauma\n    Given Alex may have experienced medical trauma in childhood\n    And family might have painful history around Alex's disability\n    When family discusses disability-related topics\n    Then the family_elohim should recognize potential trauma triggers\n    And it should support Alex in managing difficult family dynamics\n    And Alex should have tools to redirect unhelpful conversations\n    And family should be prompted toward disability justice frameworks\n    And the protocol should help family shift from medical to social model\n    And Alex should be supported in processing family history\n    And healing should be possible through better frameworks\n\n  Scenario: Alex's chosen family recognized alongside biological family\n    Given Alex may have close relationships in disability community\n    And chosen family might be more supportive than biological family\n    When the family_elohim defines family relationships\n    Then it should include Alex's chosen family members\n    And disability community bonds should be recognized as family\n    And care flows with chosen family should be tracked and valued\n    And Alex should be able to define their own family\n    And the protocol should honor diverse family structures\n    And biological family should not be privileged over chosen family\n    And Alex's full support network should be acknowledged\n\n  Scenario: Family privacy protects Alex from unwanted disclosure\n    Given Alex's disability status is sensitive information\n    And some family members might share Alex's private information\n    When family members access shared family systems\n    Then Alex should control what information family can access\n    And the family_elohim should prevent unauthorized disclosure\n    And Alex's medical information should never be shared without consent\n    And family should not be able to discuss Alex's private matters in shared spaces\n    And privacy violations should be prevented systematically\n    And Alex should be protected from family gossip or oversharing\n    And confidentiality should be enforced even within family\n\n  Scenario: Family education about disability justice improves relationships\n    Given family relationships improve when family understands disability better\n    And many families lack disability justice frameworks\n    When the family_elohim detects ableist patterns\n    Then it should provide family members with educational resources\n    And it should prompt family toward social model understanding\n    And it should share disability culture and community perspectives\n    And family should be invited to learn from Alex's expertise\n    And education should be offered supportively, not punitively\n    And the goal should be transforming family culture toward inclusion\n    And better understanding should enable healthier family relationships\n",
