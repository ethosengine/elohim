  "content": "Scenario: Activist identifies developer's cross-jurisdiction pattern\n    Given a developer is proposing controversial project\n    And uses familiar tactics from other campaigns\n    When the Observer tracks developer across municipalities\n    Then the activist sees the same firm using identical playbook in 8 cities\n    And views track record of community promises vs delivery\n    And identifies political relationships and campaign donations\n    And systematic exploitation becomes undeniable\n    And activists coordinate across jurisdictions\n",
