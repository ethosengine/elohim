  "content": "Scenario: Neighborhood boundaries respect caregiver capacity\n    Given James has extremely limited capacity for neighborhood activities\n    And well-meaning neighbors might make unsustainable demands\n    When the neighborhood_elohim manages expectations\n    Then neighbors should understand James cannot contribute labor currently\n    And they should offer support without expecting reciprocation immediately\n    And James's care work should be recognized as neighborhood contribution\n    And neighborhood should not burden caregivers with additional demands\n    And boundaries should protect James from overwhelming expectations\n",
