  "content": "Scenario: Coordinating family information sharing to protect privacy and safety\n    Given different family members have different levels of trustworthiness\n    And information about my location or situation could compromise safety\n    When I decide what to share with which family members\n    Then the family_elohim helps me track what information each person has\n    And provides graduated privacy controls for different relationships\n    And alerts me if information sharing could create safety risks\n    And helps me maintain consistent boundaries about what I disclose\n    And supports me withholding information from untrustworthy family\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of safety protocols\n    And recognizes information management as constant cognitive labor\n    And validates that privacy protection is appropriate\n",
