Household Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult\n  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want sophisticated partnership with my spouse around resource management and care coordination\n  So that we can maintain household equity and prevent burnout amid intense multigenerational care demands\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the middle-aged user \"Robert\" is registered in the system\n    And Robert is 52 years old with spouse \"Jennifer\"\n    And they have children ages 19 and 22 and parents requiring increasing care\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And household_elohim coordinates household care economy\n    And household income is $95,000/year stretched across generational needs\n\n  Scenario: Household labor distribution made visible and equitable\n    Given Robert and Jennifer both work full-time\n    And they share household management, parent care, and child support\n    And household labor distribution can become inequitable invisibly\n    When household_elohim tracks care contributions\n    Then it should make all household labor visible\n    And surface patterns: \"Jennifer has managed 78% of parent care coordination this month\"\n    And prompt discussion when distribution becomes unbalanced\n    And help them negotiate equitable distribution\n    And recognize that both partners carry substantial care burden\n    And support them in maintaining partnership equity\n    And prevent resentment from invisible labor imbalances\n\n  Scenario: Financial planning coordinates household resources across generations\n    Given Robert and Jennifer support children, care for parents, and plan for retirement\n    And they have $95k/year to allocate across competing needs\n    When household_elohim supports financial planning\n    Then it should help them balance generational financial demands\n    And surface tradeoffs: \"Increasing parent care support by $500/month reduces retirement savings\"\n    And provide scenarios for different allocation strategies\n    And help them understand long-term implications of current choices\n    And support transparent decision-making about resource allocation\n    And ensure both partners understand and agree to financial priorities\n    And protect their own financial security while supporting generations\n\n  Scenario: Elder care responsibilities coordinated between partners\n    Given Robert's parents ages 78 and 75 require increasing care\n    And Jennifer's father age 80 also needs support\n    And coordinating three aging parents is complex\n    When household_elohim coordinates elder care\n    Then it should track care needs across three parents\n    And help Robert and Jennifer distribute elder care responsibilities\n    And surface conflicts: \"Both mothers have medical appointments Tuesday 2pm\"\n    And coordinate with Robert's siblings and Jennifer's family\n    And prevent one partner from being overwhelmed by elder care\n    And recognize that elder care is shared household responsibility\n    And support them in managing care without destroying their partnership\n\n  Scenario: Household budget management amid competing generational demands\n    Given the household supports adult children financially\n    And contributes to parents' care costs\n    And maintains their own household\n    And saves for retirement\n    When household_elohim manages budget\n    Then it should track spending across generational categories\n    And surface when one category expands unsustainably\n    And provide analysis: \"Child support increased 40% last quarter while retirement savings decreased\"\n    And help them make conscious choices about allocation\n    And recognize when external support is needed\n    And support sustainable household financial management\n    And prevent financial crisis from competing demands\n\n  Scenario: Communication and decision-making supported amid stress\n    Given Robert and Jennifer are both under substantial stress\n    And care demands can strain even strong partnerships\n    And important household decisions must be made collaboratively\n    When household_elohim facilitates communication\n    Then it should provide structured decision-making support\n    And ensure both partners have voice in household governance\n    And surface when stress is affecting communication\n    And prompt for check-ins: \"You haven't had a planning conversation in 3 weeks\"\n    And support them in maintaining partnership health\n    And recognize that their relationship needs protection amid care demands\n    And prevent household governance breakdown under stress\n\n  Scenario: Adult children's transition to independence coordinated at household level\n    Given Robert and Jennifer's children are ages 19 and 22\n    And the children are establishing independence with parental support\n    And financial support needs to be coordinated between partners\n    When household_elohim tracks child support\n    Then it should make support patterns visible\n    And help Robert and Jennifer align on support philosophy\n    And surface when support exceeds household capacity\n    And track support timeline: \"Jordan has received $15k over 18 months for apartment and education\"\n    And help them negotiate appropriate levels of ongoing support\n    And prevent one partner from committing household resources unilaterally\n    And support coordinated approach to launching adult children\n\n  Scenario: Household planning for both partners' future aging\n    Given Robert and Jennifer are preparing for their own eventual aging\n    And they watch their parents navigate aging challenges\n    And they need to build resources for their own care\n    When household_elohim supports retirement and aging planning\n    Then it should help them plan for joint aging\n    And coordinate long-term care insurance, retirement housing, and care resources\n    And surface: \"Your parents' care patterns suggest you should plan for similar needs\"\n    And help them build care economy resources that will serve them later\n    And ensure they're preparing for aging with dignity\n    And support building care networks that will remain as they age\n    And prevent them from sacrificing their future for present demands\n\n  Scenario: Respite and rest built into household governance\n    Given Robert and Jennifer both experience care burden\n    And sustainable care requires rest and renewal\n    And they may deprioritize their own rest\n    When household_elohim monitors wellbeing\n    Then it should recognize when both partners need respite\n    And prompt: \"Neither of you has had break from care responsibilities in 6 weeks\"\n    And help them plan respite care for parents\n    And coordinate breaks from care demands\n    And validate that rest is essential, not selfish\n    And support them in maintaining capacity for sustainable care\n    And prevent burnout that would harm all family members\n\n  Scenario: Household care tokens reflect both partners' contributions\n    Given Robert and Jennifer both contribute substantial household labor\n    And they coordinate care for parents and support for children\n    When household_elohim calculates care tokens\n    Then both partners' contributions should be valued appropriately\n    And household labor should be recognized economically\n    And care coordination should be valued alongside direct care\n    And emotional labor should be made visible and valued\n    And both partners should see their care work recognized\n    And household care economy should operate on equity principles\n    And token allocation should support rather than strain partnership\n\n  Scenario: Household privacy maintained while coordinating with extended family\n    Given Robert and Jennifer coordinate with Robert's siblings on parent care\n    And they communicate with adult children about support\n    And they participate in community care economy\n    When household_elohim manages information sharing\n    Then it should protect household privacy while enabling coordination\n    And share parent care information with Robert's siblings appropriately\n    And keep household financial details private from extended family\n    And allow children to access relevant information without full household visibility\n    And ensure community sees care contributions without sensitive details\n    And support household autonomy while enabling family coordination\n\n  Scenario: Household governance adapts to changing life stage needs\n    Given Robert and Jennifer's care responsibilities are evolving\n    And children are moving toward independence\n    And parents are requiring increasing care\n    And they approach their own pre-retirement years\n    When household_elohim supports governance evolution\n    Then it should help them adapt to changing circumstances\n    And recognize shifts: \"Child support demands are decreasing while parent care is increasing\"\n    And support planning for next life stage transitions\n    And help them reimagine household as children leave\n    And prepare for increased elder care coordination\n    And support them in navigating lifecycle transitions together\n\n  Scenario: Household resilience built through care economy participation\n    Given Robert and Jennifer manage enormous complexity\n    And they face potential crises: parent health emergencies, child crises, financial shocks\n    When household_elohim builds resilience\n    Then it should help them build emergency preparedness\n    And connect them to community resources that can provide backup support\n    And ensure they have networks to lean on in crisis\n    And recognize that care economy participation builds reciprocal support\n    And surface their accumulated social capital\n    And help them understand that their care contributions create household resilience\n    And support sustainable household functioning amid unpredictable demands\n",
