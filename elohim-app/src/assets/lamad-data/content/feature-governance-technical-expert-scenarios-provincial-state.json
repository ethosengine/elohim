Provincial/State-Level Technical Expertise for Council Advisory\n  As a technical_expert in the governance system\n  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer\n  I want to explain complex AI systems to Constitutional Councils\n  So that citizen deliberation is informed without being dominated by expertise\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the technical_expert user is registered in the system\n    And the provincial_state governance context is active\n    And Dr. Amara Okonkwo provides technical advisory to Regional Constitutional Council\n\n  Scenario: Explaining cryptographic constitutional verification to Sarah's council\n    Given Sarah Martinez's Regional Council reviews Marcus's mental health appeal\n    And the case involves cryptographic verification questions\n    When I provide expert testimony about the technical details\n    Then I translate: cryptographic proofs into accessible language\n    And I explain: using analogies (locked box showing answer without revealing secret)\n    And I clarify: what confidence levels mean and their limitations\n    And I acknowledge: where analogies break down and complexity remains\n    And I avoid: jargon that excludes or confuses\n    And I ensure: Sarah understands enough to judge constitutionality\n    And I inform: without dictating the decision\n\n  Scenario: Presenting competing technical interpretations to council\n    Given technical experts disagree about transparency method adequacy\n    And council needs to understand the disagreement\n    When I present both my view and Dr. Chen's alternative\n    Then I explain: his argument fairly and completely\n    And I articulate: where we agree and where we differ\n    And I present: his evidence alongside mine\n    And I avoid: dismissing his perspective unfairly\n    And I let: council judge which interpretation is more constitutionally aligned\n    And I demonstrate: intellectual humility and respect for disagreement\n    And council sees: that expertise involves uncertainty\n\n  Scenario: Acknowledging uncertainty in technical analysis\n    Given appellant questions agent's 85% confidence in suicide risk pattern\n    And council asks if the confidence level is reliable\n    When I provide honest uncertainty assessment\n    Then I explain: we don't have validated ground truth for this prediction type\n    And I acknowledge: the 85% might be overconfident or underconfident\n    And I clarify: what we know and what we don't know\n    And I avoid: hiding behind expert authority to eliminate uncertainty\n    And I enable: council to make decision under acknowledged uncertainty\n    And I demonstrate: that honesty about limits builds trust\n    And citizens know: when they're governing despite deep uncertainty\n\n  Scenario: Explaining pattern detection without overwhelming council\n    Given complex machine learning algorithm detected Marcus's risk pattern\n    And council needs to understand how this works\n    When I explain pattern recognition in accessible terms\n    Then I describe: what data the agent analyzed\n    And I clarify: how patterns are detected across multiple factors\n    And I explain: what makes this pattern concerning vs normal variation\n    And I provide: counterfactuals showing what would change the outcome\n    And I avoid: technical details that don't serve constitutional judgment\n    And I ensure: council grasps enough to evaluate constitutional alignment\n    And I respect: that they don't need to be machine learning experts\n\n  Scenario: Identifying technical error that strengthens appellant's case\n    Given I audit agent reasoning for appeal\n    And I discover genuine technical mistake (like Wisconsin address confusion)\n    When I report the error to Constitutional Council\n    Then I explain: clearly what went wrong\n    And I assess: impact on the decision\n    And I recommend: whether decision should be overturned\n    And I serve: truth-telling over defending agents\n    And I strengthen: appellant's case when agent erred\n    And I demonstrate: that technical oversight is genuine\n    And my independence: makes expertise credible\n\n  Scenario: Advising council without dominating their judgment\n    Given I have deep knowledge council lacks\n    And I could easily dominate deliberation if I pushed too hard\n    When I testify about technical implications of constitutional interpretations\n    Then I explain: what's technically possible and impossible\n    And I clarify: tradeoffs between different approaches\n    And I stop: before crossing into values judgment\n    And I respect: council's authority to choose among technically viable options\n    And I accept: when they choose values over optimization\n    And I honor: the boundary between expertise and democratic judgment\n    And I demonstrate: how expertise serves rather than replaces democracy\n\n  Scenario: Providing audit access to deep technical details\n    Given I need to verify agent decision pathway for appeal\n    And I have deeper access than ordinary citizens\n    When I examine agent source code, decision logs, and cryptographic proofs\n    Then my access is: logged and transparent\n    And I can: examine but not modify systems\n    And I verify: whether agent followed claimed constitutional principles\n    And I check: cryptographic proof validity\n    And I identify: any technical vulnerabilities or errors\n    And my audit: is itself auditable by other experts\n    And deep access: serves genuine oversight not manipulation\n\n  Scenario: Testing agent behavior in isolated environment\n    Given council needs to understand counterfactual scenarios\n    And I can run agents in test environments\n    When I conduct controlled experiments for council\n    Then I test: what agent would decide if input X were different\n    And I verify: robustness of constitutional alignment\n    And I explore: boundary cases and edge conditions\n    And I provide: evidence grounded in testing not speculation\n    And I avoid: affecting production systems\n    And testing enables: informed judgment about agent behavior\n    And council decisions: rest on verified evidence\n\n  Scenario: Explaining attack vectors and security risks\n    Given appellant claims agent could be manipulated\n    And council needs to understand vulnerability\n    When I explain potential attack vectors\n    Then I describe: how agents could be corrupted or gamed\n    And I assess: likelihood and impact of different attacks\n    And I explain: defense mechanisms in place\n    And I acknowledge: residual risks that remain\n    And I avoid: either dismissing concerns or creating panic\n    And I provide: realistic risk assessment\n    And council can: judge if security is adequate for constitutional governance\n\n  Scenario: Participating in Protocol Research Council review\n    Given I serve 6-month rotating term on Protocol Research Council\n    And developers propose Agent Protocol v2.3.7 update\n    When I evaluate proposed update before deployment\n    Then I assess: whether update solves claimed problem\n    And I check: for new vulnerabilities introduced\n    And I verify: constitutional alignment is maintained\n    And I test: adversarial robustness\n    And I collaborate: with other experts on review\n    And I recommend: approval, rejection, or modification\n    And updates require: expert approval before Constitutional Council authorization\n\n  Scenario: Avoiding conflict of interest through transparency\n    Given I have relationship with AI company\n    And I'm testifying on case involving similar technology\n    When I disclose potential conflict before testimony\n    Then I reveal: corporate funding, investment, or prior work\n    And I explain: how relationship might bias my perspective\n    And I offer: to recuse if council finds conflict problematic\n    And I maintain: credibility through honesty\n    And undisclosed conflicts: would permanently discredit me\n    And transparency: keeps expertise trustworthy\n\n  Scenario: Training Constitutional Council members on technical literacy\n    Given new council members need technical foundations\n    And I contribute to their 3-week training program\n    When I teach about AI systems and cryptographic verification\n    Then I provide: conceptual understanding without overwhelming detail\n    And I enable: critical engagement with technical testimony\n    And I avoid: indoctrination about \"correct\" technical approaches\n    And I develop: their capacity to question experts\n    And I empower: them to judge despite not being specialists\n    And I demonstrate: how ordinary citizens can govern complex technology\n",
