  "content": "Scenario: Schools recognize single-parent families in forms and communications\n    Given school forms typically ask for \"mother and father\" information\n    And communications assume two-parent household availability\n    When schools collect family information\n    Then the educational_elohim should advocate for single-parent-inclusive forms\n    And forms should acknowledge diverse family structures respectfully\n    And communications should not assume two parents are available\n    And schools should recognize single parents manage everything alone\n    And Maria should not have to repeatedly explain or defend her family structure\n",
