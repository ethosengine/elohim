"@epic:value_scanner\n@user_type:adult\n@governance_layer:workplace_organizational\n@related_users:worker,parent,caregiver,employer,colleague\n@related_layers:individual,household,family\n@elohim_agents:personal_agent,workplace_elohim\n\nFeature: Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Adult\n  As an adult worker with care responsibilities\n  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer\n  I want workplace policies to recognize workers' care economy participation\n  So that employment supports rather than undermines household and community care\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the adult user \"Sarah\" is registered in the system\n    And Sarah works full-time as a teacher\n    And Sarah has care responsibilities for children and aging parents\n    And the workplace/organizational governance context is active\n    And the workplace_elohim coordinates work-care integration\n    And Sarah's employer participates in care economy recognition\n\n  Scenario: Workplace recognizes employees' care responsibilities\n    Given Sarah balances full-time teaching with intensive parenting\n    And her care responsibilities affect her work capacity\n    When workplace policies are designed\n    Then the workplace_elohim should make employees' care work visible\n    And Sarah's care responsibilities should be recognized, not ignored\n    And workplace should acknowledge that workers have lives beyond employment\n    And policies should support work-care integration, not create conflict\n    And care economy should inform workplace culture\n\n  Scenario: Flexible scheduling accommodates care economy participation\n    Given Sarah needs to manage children's schedules, parent appointments, household tasks\n    And rigid work schedules create impossible conflicts\n    When Sarah's work schedule is determined\n    Then the workplace_elohim should coordinate with personal_agent\n    And flexible scheduling should accommodate care responsibilities\n    And Sarah should be able to handle family emergencies without job risk\n    And workplace should enable sustainable work-care balance\n    And flexibility should be policy, not personal favor\n\n  Scenario: Fair compensation reflects that care work requires time and energy\n    Given Sarah's care responsibilities are substantial\n    And she needs sufficient income to support household\n    When Sarah's compensation is determined\n    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for living wages\n    And compensation should enable household flourishing, not just survival\n    And Sarah should earn enough to afford care work time\n    And wages should reflect that workers have care responsibilities\n    And fair compensation should support care economy participation\n\n  Scenario: Family leave policies support care during critical periods\n    Given Sarah may need time for childbirth, child illness, parent care, family emergencies\n    And traditional leave policies are inadequate\n    When family care needs arise\n    Then workplace should provide adequate paid family leave\n    And leave should not require Sarah to sacrifice career advancement\n    And the workplace_elohim should coordinate leave with care needs\n    And family leave should be dignified and sufficient\n    And policies should recognize care emergencies are inevitable\n\n  Scenario: Workplace boundaries protect capacity for household care\n    Given Sarah's care responsibilities require substantial time and energy\n    And work can expand to consume all available capacity\n    When workplace demands are placed on Sarah\n    Then the workplace_elohim should monitor total demands\n    And it should alert Sarah when work threatens care capacity\n    And it should help her maintain boundaries\n    And workplace should respect that Sarah has legitimate care obligations\n    And boundaries should protect Sarah's sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Care economy data supports worker advocacy for policy changes\n    Given Sarah and colleagues want better workplace care policies\n    And employers may not understand workers' care burdens\n    When Sarah advocates for workplace policy changes\n    Then the workplace_elohim should provide aggregated care economy data\n    And advocacy should be strengthened by quantified evidence\n    And Sarah should show that care responsibilities are substantial\n    And policy discussions should be informed by actual care patterns\n    And workers should use care economy data to win policy improvements\n\n  Scenario: Preventing work-care conflict that causes burnout\n    Given Sarah faces constant conflict between work and care demands\n    And this conflict drives burnout in working parents\n    When the workplace_elohim monitors Sarah's situation\n    Then it should detect when work-care conflicts are unsustainable\n    And it should alert Sarah before burnout occurs\n    And it should suggest interventions (boundaries, policy advocacy, job changes)\n    And it should help Sarah maintain long-term career sustainability\n    And burnout prevention should be proactive, not reactive\n\n  Scenario: Professional care work valued in care economy framework\n    Given Sarah's teaching is professional care work\n    And care economy should recognize professional caregiving\n    When Sarah's care contributions are tracked\n    Then her professional teaching should count as care labor\n    And it should be valued alongside household care\n    And Sarah should see her career as care economy participation\n    And professional care workers should be recognized explicitly\n    And care economy should include paid care work, not just unpaid\n\n  Scenario: Workplace culture shift from extraction to care economy principles\n    Given Sarah's workplace could adopt care economy principles\n    And organizational culture shapes employee well-being\n    When Sarah advocates for cultural change\n    Then the workplace_elohim should support care economy adoption\n    And workplace culture should value employee well-being\n    And success should be measured by care, not just extraction\n    And organizational culture should recognize care creates value\n    And Sarah's workplace should demonstrate care economy in employment\n\n  Scenario: Workplace privacy protects care economy data from employer access\n    Given Sarah participates in care economy\n    And this generates data about her personal life\n    When workplace wants information about employees\n    Then Sarah's personal care economy data must be completely private\n    And employers should never access household care patterns\n    And the workplace_elohim should only see work-relevant information\n    And Sarah's privacy should be absolute in personal care matters\n    And workplace participation should not require personal data sacrifice\n\n  Scenario: Workplace care economy network provides peer support\n    Given Sarah and colleagues all balance work with care responsibilities\n    And peer support improves well-being and effectiveness\n    When workplace adopts care economy principles\n    Then the workplace_elohim should facilitate peer support networks\n    And workers should share care economy strategies\n    And Sarah should connect with others managing similar challenges\n    And workplace community should strengthen through care economy\n    And collective support should reduce individual burden\n\n  Scenario: Part-time and flexible work options support intensive care periods\n    Given Sarah may need reduced hours during intensive care periods\n    And full-time work may be unsustainable at some life stages\n    When Sarah's care responsibilities increase\n    Then workplace should offer part-time and flexible work options\n    And reduced hours should not mean career penalty\n    And the workplace_elohim should coordinate schedule adjustments\n    And Sarah should be able to modulate work commitment based on care needs\n    And career paths should accommodate care economy participation\n\n  Scenario: Workplace advocacy connects to broader care economy transformation\n    Given Sarah's workplace advocacy could influence other employers\n    And workplace policy changes could spread\n    When Sarah's workplace successfully implements care economy policies\n    Then the workplace_elohim should share success with other organizations\n    And effective policies should be documented and promoted\n    And Sarah's advocacy should contribute to broader transformation\n    And workplace care economy should grow from successful examples\n    And employment should shift toward care economy principles at scale\n",
