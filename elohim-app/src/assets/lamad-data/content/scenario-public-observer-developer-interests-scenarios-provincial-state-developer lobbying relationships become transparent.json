  "content": "Scenario: Developer lobbying relationships become transparent\n    Given a developer lobbies state legislature for favorable policy\n    And makes campaign donations to key committee members\n    When the Observer tracks lobbying and political relationships\n    Then constituents see: $250K in donations to housing committee members\n    And identify correlation between donations and votes on developer-friendly bills\n    And the developer faces accountability for political influence\n    And legislators face scrutiny about who they serve\n    And transparent relationships create pressure for merit-based policy\n",
