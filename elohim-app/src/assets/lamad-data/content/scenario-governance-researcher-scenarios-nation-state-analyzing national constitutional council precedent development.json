  "content": "Scenario: Analyzing national Constitutional Council precedent development\n    Given National Constitutional Council has created precedents affecting millions\n    And I have access to five years of national-level decisions\n    When I analyze how constitutional interpretation evolves over time\n    Then I examine: consistency of principles across diverse cases\n    And I track: precedent citation patterns and influence\n    And I identify: watershed decisions that reshaped interpretation\n    And I analyze: how dissenting opinions influence future majorities\n    And I assess: whether interpretation drifts from constitutional text\n    And I explore: emergence of constitutional \"common law\" through cases\n    And My research reveals: how citizen governance creates coherent jurisprudence\n",
