  "content": "Scenario: Participating in global constitutional convention as observer\n    Given Global Constitutional Convention convenes with 10,000 delegates\n    And I attend as policy maker observer not delegate\n    When I observe global deliberative democracy\n    Then I learn: from how diverse humanity deliberates together\n    And I see: what enables agreement despite profound disagreement\n    And I witness: ordinary citizens governing existential questions\n    And I prepare: to implement constitutional amendments in my nation\n    And I translate: global constitutional evolution into national law\n    And I am humbled: by wisdom of randomly-selected citizens\n    And I understand: my role as servant of democratic will\n",
