  "content": "Scenario: Comparative methodology testing different governance models\n    Given I want to compare sortition councils to alternative governance approaches\n    And some regions use elected representatives, others expert panels, others algorithms\n    When I conduct systematic comparison across governance models\n    Then I examine: decision quality (outcomes, constitutional alignment, legitimacy)\n    And I assess: participation (who governs, how accessible, how diverse)\n    And I measure: trust (public confidence in decisions)\n    And I analyze: adaptability (responding to new challenges)\n    And I compare: costs (resources required vs benefits delivered)\n    And I provide: evidence about relative strengths of different models\n    And My research serves: democratic choice among governance alternatives\n",
