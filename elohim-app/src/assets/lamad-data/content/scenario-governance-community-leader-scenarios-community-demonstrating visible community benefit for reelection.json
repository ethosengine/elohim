  "content": "Scenario: Demonstrating visible community benefit for reelection\n    Given I face reelection and need to show protocol serves Riverside\n    And residents judge me on outcomes not philosophy\n    When I present annual protocol review to community\n    Then I show: data on wellbeing improvements (loneliness down, satisfaction up)\n    And I report: crisis response effectiveness and economic resilience\n    And I acknowledge: failures and challenges honestly\n    And I demonstrate: transparent accountability\n    And I propose: continuing with recommended calibrations\n    And residents vote: 68% to continue (not consensus but democratic)\n    And I remain accountable: through normal democratic processes\n    And evidence matters: for sustaining political support\n",
