  "content": "Scenario: Providing evidence to Senator Ruiz for policy development\n    Given Senator Ruiz is drafting AI governance legislation\n    And she needs evidence about what regulatory approaches help vs harm\n    When I brief her committee on my regional research findings\n    Then I present: rigorous evaluation of protocol outcomes\n    And I explain: what factors predict successful adoption\n    And I provide: evidence about marginalized community access\n    And I offer: comparative findings about governance models\n    And I testify: honestly about limitations and uncertainties\n    And I maintain: independence by reporting truth not advocacy\n    And My research becomes: evidence base for democratic policy making\n",
