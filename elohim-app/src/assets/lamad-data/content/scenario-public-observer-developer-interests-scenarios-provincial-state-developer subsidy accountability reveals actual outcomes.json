  "content": "Scenario: Developer subsidy accountability reveals actual outcomes\n    Given a developer received $10M state tax credit for \"affordable housing\"\n    And claimed it would produce 200 affordable units\n    When the Observer tracks subsidy outcomes\n    Then analysis shows: only 35 units meet affordability criteria\n    And most units are market-rate generating developer profit\n    And state subsidy mostly subsidized luxury development\n    And taxpayers see poor return on public investment\n    And accountability creates pressure for subsidy reform\n",
