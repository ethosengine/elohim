Household Layer Dignity-Preserving Care Coordination for Elderly\n  As an elderly person living in my own home\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want to maintain my household with support while preserving my sense of home\n  So that I remain in control of my own living space despite needing assistance\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the elderly user \"Helen\" is registered in the system\n    And Helen lives in her own home\n    And Helen requires support for household maintenance\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And the household_elohim coordinates support services\n    And Helen's sense of home is critical to her identity\n\n  Scenario: Home maintenance coordinated with dignity preservation\n    Given Helen can no longer manage all household tasks independently\n    And she needs help with cleaning, repairs, and maintenance\n    When the household_elohim coordinates support services\n    Then Helen should remain the authority in her own home\n    And support workers should be coordinated around her preferences\n    And the household should feel like hers, not an institution\n    And her choices about how things are done should be respected\n    And assistance should enhance her ability to stay home\n    And she should not feel like a guest in her own space\n    And the protocol should preserve the dignity of \"this is my home\"\n\n  Scenario: Household safety modifications balance autonomy and protection\n    Given Helen has mobility limitations and fall risk\n    And safety modifications would reduce risk\n    When household safety needs are assessed\n    Then modifications should be proposed, not imposed\n    And Helen should decide what changes occur in her home\n    And options should be presented with dignity: \"Would grab bars help you feel safer?\"\n    And her preferences about aesthetics and comfort should matter\n    And safety should support her autonomy, not restrict it\n    And the goal should be enabling continued home living\n    And Helen's agency over her space should be preserved\n\n  Scenario: Home health aide coordination respects household authority\n    Given Helen receives visits from home health aides\n    And multiple aides may rotate through her schedule\n    When aides enter Helen's household\n    Then Helen should remain the authority in her space\n    And her household_elohim should communicate her preferences to aides\n    And aides should be briefed on Helen's routines and wishes\n    And consistency should be maintained across different workers\n    And Helen should not have to repeatedly assert her preferences\n    And care should be provided on her terms in her space\n    And the protocol should establish Helen's household sovereignty\n\n  Scenario: Household budget management with severe resource constraint\n    Given Helen's $24k/year income barely covers necessities\n    And household expenses are challenging on fixed income\n    When the household_elohim manages budget tracking\n    Then it should help Helen navigate financial limitations\n    And priority should be given to keeping her housed\n    And community resources for home maintenance should be surfaced\n    And no shame should attach to needing financial assistance\n    And the system should connect her to care economy support\n    And assistance should flow as reciprocity, not charity\n    And Helen's ability to remain in her home should be prioritized\n\n  Scenario: Household routines maintained for cognitive support\n    Given Helen's dementia makes routine important for functioning\n    And familiar patterns help her maintain independence\n    When the household_elohim supports daily routines\n    Then her established patterns should be preserved\n    And reminders should support her existing habits\n    And changes should be minimized to reduce confusion\n    And her personal_agent should say \"Time for your morning tea, like always\"\n    And routine should provide cognitive scaffolding\n    And household familiarity should support her capability\n    And the protocol should recognize that routine enables autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Household technology adapted for accessibility\n    Given Helen has difficulty with complex technology\n    And her home includes various devices and systems\n    When household technology is configured\n    Then all systems should be simplified for her access\n    And voice control should be available throughout\n    And large, simple controls should replace complex interfaces\n    And emergency systems should be easily accessible\n    And technology should serve her, not frustrate her\n    And assistive devices should integrate seamlessly\n    And the household should be adapted to her capabilities\n\n  Scenario: Shared living space decisions preserve elderly authority\n    Given Helen's daughter occasionally stays to provide care\n    And Helen's home is multigenerational at times\n    When household decisions need to be made\n    Then Helen's authority in her own home should be paramount\n    And family members should defer to her household preferences\n    And the household_elohim should mediate conflicting preferences\n    And Helen's long-standing patterns should have priority\n    And she should not feel like she's lost control of her space\n    And care recipients should not become subordinate in their own homes\n    And the protocol should preserve hierarchy: this is Helen's home\n\n  Scenario: Household care coordination prevents caregiver burnout\n    Given Helen's daughter provides substantial household support\n    And family caregiving risks burnout\n    When the household_elohim tracks care labor\n    Then it should identify when daughter's burden is unsustainable\n    And it should suggest respite care before crisis occurs\n    And it should coordinate additional support sources\n    And daughter's care work should be recognized and valued\n    And care tokens should accumulate for her labor\n    And the system should protect both Helen and her caregivers\n    And sustainable care networks should be built proactively\n\n  Scenario: Household accessibility increases with declining mobility\n    Given Helen's mobility is gradually declining\n    And her household needs ongoing adaptation\n    When accessibility needs change over time\n    Then the household_elohim should proactively suggest adaptations\n    And Helen should be consulted on all modifications\n    And her home should evolve to support her changing capabilities\n    And the goal should be maximum independence at home\n    And dignity should be preserved throughout adaptation\n    And the protocol should enable aging in place with grace\n    And her ability to remain home should be extended as long as possible\n\n  Scenario: Emergency response configured to Helen's advance directives\n    Given emergency situations may occur in Helen's household\n    And Helen has specific wishes about medical intervention\n    When emergency protocols are configured\n    Then her advance directives should guide emergency response\n    And emergency contacts should understand her wishes\n    And the household_elohim should communicate her preferences to responders\n    And her values should be respected even in crisis\n    And emergency systems should serve her autonomy, not override it\n    And her voice should remain authoritative about her own care\n    And the protocol should ensure her wishes guide all household emergency response\n\n  Scenario: Household privacy maintained despite care coordination needs\n    Given multiple people enter Helen's home to provide care\n    And care coordination requires information sharing\n    When household privacy is managed\n    Then Helen should control what information is shared with whom\n    And her personal spaces should remain private\n    And intimate care should be provided with maximum dignity\n    And she should have privacy in her own home\n    And surveillance should be minimized to necessity\n    And her home should not feel like an institution\n    And the protocol should preserve the privacy of home life\n\n  Scenario: Household contribution recognition for care reciprocity\n    Given Helen has lived in this home for 40 years\n    And she raised family and contributed to community from this household\n    When household care economy is tracked\n    Then her lifetime of household labor should be visible\n    And her decades of contribution should create legitimate claims\n    And current care receipt should be framed as reciprocity\n    And she should not feel like a burden in her own home\n    And the household_elohim should surface her contribution history\n    And care flowing to her should be recognized as earned through lifetime of giving\n",
