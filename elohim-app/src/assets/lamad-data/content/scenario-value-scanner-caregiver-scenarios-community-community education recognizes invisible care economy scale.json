  "content": "Scenario: Community education recognizes invisible care economy scale\n    Given community members don't understand family caregiver reality\n    And invisibility perpetuates lack of support\n    When the community_elohim demonstrates care economy scale\n    Then it should show family caregivers provide $470 billion/year nationally\n    And it should quantify caregiving in local community specifically\n    And community should recognize dependence on invisible care work\n    And education should transform attitudes toward family caregiving\n    And visibility should drive policy changes supporting caregivers\n",
