  "content": "Scenario: Identifying need for capability limits until problems solved\n    Given agents approach human comprehension limits\n    And National Council questions if oversight remains meaningful\n    When I assess whether democratic governance can continue\n    Then I honestly acknowledge: limits of our technical understanding\n    And I clarify: what can and cannot be verified currently\n    And I explore: research pathways to better explainability\n    And I may recommend: limiting agent capability until oversight works\n    And I accept: that this may slow AI development\n    And I prioritize: democratic governance over technical optimization\n    And I demonstrate: humility about technological limits\n",
