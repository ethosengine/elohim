  "content": "Scenario: Asserting parenting authority despite institutional scrutiny\n    Given institutions are monitoring my parenting during crisis\n    And I fear judgment or intervention\n    When I make parenting decisions based on my knowledge of my children\n    Then the Value Scanner validates my parental authority\n    And documents my sophisticated parenting labor\n    And helps me articulate my parenting reasoning to institutions\n    And recognizes that I am the expert on my children's needs\n    And supports me in resisting inappropriate institutional interference\n    And my personal_agent helps me present my parenting capability effectively\n    And the care token system makes visible my substantial parenting contributions\n    And my parenting is recognized as valuable work, not scrutinized as potential failure\n",
