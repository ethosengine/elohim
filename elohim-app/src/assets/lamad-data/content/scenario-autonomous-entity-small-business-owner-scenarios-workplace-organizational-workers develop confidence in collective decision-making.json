  "content": "Scenario: Workers develop confidence in collective decision-making\n    Given workers have never governed a business democratically\n    And they may doubt their capability initially\n    When early democratic decisions succeed\n    Then workers see their collective wisdom produces good outcomes\n    And small decisions (schedule adjustments, supply orders) build confidence\n    And larger decisions (pricing strategy, service expansion) follow as capacity grows\n    And workplace_elohim documents successful democratic decision patterns\n    And worker self-governance becomes normalized, not exceptional\n",
