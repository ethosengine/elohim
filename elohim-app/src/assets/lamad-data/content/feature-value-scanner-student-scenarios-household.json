Household Layer Value Recognition for Student\n  As a student living with roommates and learning household coordination\n  Operating at the household governance layer\n  I want fair distribution of household labor and recognition of care contributions\n  So that our shared living is sustainable and equitable for all\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the student user \"Kenji\" is registered in the system\n    And Kenji lives in shared apartment with three roommates\n    And Kenji is the primary cook for the household\n    And the household has four people total\n    And the household governance context is active\n    And the household_elohim could coordinate shared living\n    And roommates have different schedules, budgets, and capabilities\n\n  Scenario: Making invisible household care labor visible to roommates\n    Given Kenji cooks meals for all four roommates regularly\n    And he plans menus, shops for ingredients, and manages kitchen\n    When the household_elohim tracks Kenji's household contributions\n    Then it should quantify his cooking labor in care tokens\n    And it should make visible that he provides nutrition care for four people\n    And his roommates should see \"Kenji cooked 18 meals this week for household\"\n    And invisible care work should become undeniably visible\n    And the system should prevent resentment from invisible labor\n    And fair household coordination requires visibility\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating bulk buying to maximize household budget efficiency\n    Given Kenji and roommates each have limited grocery budgets\n    And bulk buying saves money but requires coordination\n    When Kenji proposes coordinated bulk purchase of rice, beans, and cooking oil\n    Then the household_elohim should facilitate group buying coordination\n    And it should track who pays what and how costs are divided\n    And it should calculate savings: \"Bulk rice saves each person $8/month\"\n    And it should help roommates see financial benefit of coordination\n    And the system should reduce friction in shared purchasing\n    And collective buying should be easy and fair\n\n  Scenario: Fair distribution of household labor among roommates\n    Given Kenji does most cooking but little cleaning\n    And roommates have different strengths and available time\n    When the household_elohim tracks all household labor\n    Then it should measure cooking, cleaning, shopping, maintenance, and organizing\n    And it should show each roommate's contribution: \"Kenji: 18hrs, Maya: 6hrs, Sam: 8hrs, Jordan: 4hrs\"\n    And it should surface imbalances explicitly\n    And it should facilitate conversation about fair redistribution\n    And the system should prevent exploitation through visibility\n    And household equity should be measurable and adjustable\n\n  Scenario: Roommate coordination for shared meals vs individual cooking\n    Given some meals are shared and some are individual\n    And coordination requires planning around different schedules\n    When the household_elohim manages meal coordination\n    Then it should track who's eating shared meals vs cooking separately\n    And it should help schedule shared dinners when roommates are available\n    And it should recognize Kenji's labor preparing shared meals\n    And it should calculate fair cost sharing for shared food\n    And the system should make coordination easy rather than burdensome\n    And shared meals should build household community\n\n  Scenario: Preventing roommate conflict through proactive visibility\n    Given household labor imbalances breed resentment\n    And students often avoid difficult conversations\n    When the household_elohim detects emerging conflict patterns\n    Then it should surface issues before they become conflicts\n    And it should show data: \"Jordan hasn't contributed household labor in 3 weeks\"\n    And it should facilitate constructive conversation with neutral framing\n    And it should help roommates renegotiate responsibilities\n    And preventive intervention should maintain household harmony\n    And the system should support healthy household dynamics\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing different resource contributions to household\n    Given Kenji contributes time and labor but limited money\n    And one roommate might contribute more financially but less labor\n    When the household_elohim tracks all forms of contribution\n    Then it should value both care labor and financial contributions\n    And it should recognize Kenji's cooking as economic contribution\n    And it should show equivalence: \"Kenji's cooking worth $X in meal prep time saved\"\n    And it should prevent assumption that money is only real contribution\n    And the system should value diverse contribution types\n    And household equity should include labor, time, and money\n\n  Scenario: Teaching household management as life skill\n    Given Kenji is learning to coordinate shared living\n    And household management is essential adult capability\n    When the personal_agent supports Kenji's household skill development\n    Then it should teach him to negotiate responsibilities fairly\n    And it should help him communicate needs and boundaries\n    And it should build his capability in conflict resolution\n    And it should recognize household coordination as professional-grade skill\n    And the agent should frame this as valuable life learning\n    And Kenji should develop skills that serve all future shared living\n\n  Scenario: Shared household inventory and waste reduction\n    Given four roommates buy food independently\n    And lack of coordination leads to duplicate purchases and waste\n    When the household_elohim manages shared inventory\n    Then it should track what's in shared pantry and refrigerator\n    And it should prevent duplicate buying: \"You already have pasta, Maya bought it Tuesday\"\n    And it should identify food about to expire\n    And it should suggest meals using existing ingredients\n    And the system should reduce household food waste\n    And coordination should save money and resources for all roommates\n\n  Scenario: Household emergency support and mutual aid\n    Given one roommate might face financial crisis or sudden need\n    And students often live very close to financial edge\n    When a household member experiences emergency\n    Then the household_elohim should facilitate mutual aid\n    And it should help coordinate support: \"Can roommates each contribute $20 to help Jordan?\"\n    And it should track emergency help as care tokens\n    And it should build culture of reciprocal support\n    And the system should recognize households as safety nets\n    And roommate mutual aid should be valued and visible\n\n  Scenario: Transition and turnover management in student households\n    Given student housing is temporary and roommates change\n    And Kenji might have different roommates each year\n    When roommates transition in and out of household\n    Then the household_elohim should document established patterns\n    And it should help new roommates integrate into household norms\n    And it should preserve institutional knowledge across transitions\n    And it should help negotiate new arrangements with new people\n    And the system should reduce friction from household turnover\n    And care economy patterns should transfer across roommate changes\n\n  Scenario: Privacy boundaries in shared living space\n    Given Kenji shares space but deserves privacy\n    And household coordination requires some information sharing\n    When the household_elohim manages household data\n    Then it should share only household-relevant information with roommates\n    And Kenji's personal data should remain private\n    And roommates should see his cooking contributions, not his financial struggles\n    And privacy boundaries should be clear and respected\n    And the system should balance coordination needs with personal privacy\n    And Kenji should control what household information is shared\n\n  Scenario: Building household community through shared care\n    Given Kenji and roommates are temporarily living together\n    And they could just be strangers sharing space\n    When the household_elohim fosters care economy culture\n    Then it should help them build genuine community\n    And it should recognize shared meals as community building\n    And it should value emotional support among roommates\n    And it should show how care contributions create belonging\n    And the system should help transform roommates into household family\n    And student households should be recognized as temporary but real communities\n",
