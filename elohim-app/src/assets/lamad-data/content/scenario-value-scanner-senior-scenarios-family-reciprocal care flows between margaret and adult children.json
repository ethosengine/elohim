  "content": "Scenario: Reciprocal care flows between Margaret and adult children\n    Given Margaret provides childcare for her daughter's family\n    And her daughter provides technology help and transportation\n    When the family_elohim coordinates these reciprocal care exchanges\n    Then all care flows should be tracked in both directions\n    And Margaret gives care (grandchildren); daughter gives care (support)\n    And reciprocity should be visible to prevent imbalance\n    And both generations' contributions should be valued\n    And the relationship should feel equitable, not one-sided\n    And multigenerational care patterns should be sustainable\n",
