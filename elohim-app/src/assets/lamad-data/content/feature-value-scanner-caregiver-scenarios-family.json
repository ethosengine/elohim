Family Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver\n  As a caregiver coordinating care across family relationships\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want family care complexity visible and supported across generations\n  So that family care economy sustains multiple care relationships simultaneously\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the caregiver user \"James\" is registered in the system\n    And James cares for husband David (52) with early-onset Alzheimer's\n    And James also coordinates care for his mother (76, recently widowed)\n    And James has relationships with David's parents and extended family\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy\n    And James navigates complex family dynamics amid intensive caregiving\n\n  Scenario: Sandwich generation care burden made visible across family\n    Given James cares simultaneously for spouse and aging parent\n    And he provides intensive care in both directions\n    When the family_elohim tracks James's care contributions\n    Then his care work for David should be quantified fully\n    And his care coordination for his mother should be visible\n    And extended family should see his dual care burden\n    And sandwich generation reality should be recognized explicitly\n    And family should understand the overwhelming scope of James's labor\n    And visibility should enable family support rather than more demands\n\n  Scenario: Spousal care recognized as professional-grade family contribution\n    Given James provides skilled nursing-level care for David\n    And this care is rendered invisible because they're married\n    When the family_elohim evaluates James's spousal care\n    Then it should be valued at professional care rates\n    And care tokens should reflect $50k+/year equivalent value\n    And \"caring for spouse out of love\" should not erase economic value\n    And family should recognize James is doing professional work\n    And spousal caregiving should be visible as enormous contribution\n    And marriage should not make care work economically invisible\n\n  Scenario: Family boundary management as care recipient's family intrudes\n    Given David's parents have opinions about his care\n    And they may question James's decisions\n    When family boundaries are negotiated\n    Then the family_elohim should support James's care authority\n    And it should recognize him as primary caregiver and spouse\n    And it should help James maintain appropriate boundaries\n    And David's family should provide support, not interference\n    And family governance should respect caregiving relationship\n    And boundaries should be clear when family dynamics become difficult\n\n  Scenario: Care coordination with James's mother while caring for David\n    Given James's mother (76) needs increasing support\n    And James is already overwhelmed caring for David\n    When James coordinates care for his mother\n    Then the family_elohim should help him manage both relationships\n    And it should recognize he cannot provide intensive care in both directions\n    And it should help coordinate additional support for his mother\n    And it should prevent James from collapsing under dual burden\n    And family care should be sustainable across multiple recipients\n\n  Scenario: Extended family contributions distributed equitably\n    Given James carries enormous family care burden\n    And other family members could provide some support\n    When the family_elohim analyzes family care distribution\n    Then it should identify who is doing what\n    And it should make visible that James is carrying most burden\n    And it should prevent care from falling entirely on one person\n    And it should enable equitable distribution negotiations\n    And family care should be shared fairly, not concentrated\n\n  Scenario: Family financial support recognition as care contribution\n    Given James's household income has plummeted due to caregiving\n    And family members may provide financial assistance\n    When family financial support is tracked\n    Then the family_elohim should recognize financial help as care contribution\n    And it should value financial support alongside direct care labor\n    And family members unable to provide direct care can contribute financially\n    And care economy should include multiple forms of contribution\n    And financial support should be recognized, not taken for granted\n\n  Scenario: Family grief support as David's condition progresses\n    Given entire family grieves David's decline\n    And James's grief is compounded by providing daily care\n    When the family_elohim recognizes collective family grief\n    Then it should connect family to grief support resources\n    And it should acknowledge progressive loss affects everyone\n    And it should coordinate family emotional support for each other\n    And James should receive family support, not just provide care\n    And family should process grief together while supporting James\n\n  Scenario: In-law family dynamics around David's care\n    Given David's parents struggle with their son's diagnosis\n    And they may have complicated feelings about James's caregiving\n    When the family_elohim navigates in-law relationships\n    Then it should recognize complex family dynamics\n    And it should support James's relationship with David's family\n    And it should help manage their grief without undermining James\n    And in-law relationships should be supportive of James's caregiving\n    And family care economy should include chosen family bonds\n\n  Scenario: Family care legacy planning as David's condition progresses\n    Given David's condition will continue to worsen\n    And James may eventually need institutional care support\n    When family plans for David's future care\n    Then the family_elohim should facilitate family care planning\n    And it should help family discuss difficult future scenarios\n    And it should coordinate family resources for potential needs\n    And family should plan together for multiple care scenarios\n    And care legacy planning should involve whole family\n\n  Scenario: Family respite coordination to prevent James's burnout\n    Given James needs regular respite or he will collapse\n    And family members could provide some respite care\n    When the family_elohim coordinates respite\n    Then it should identify family members who could help\n    And it should schedule regular respite periods\n    And it should ensure James gets breaks from intensive care\n    And family should actively provide respite, not just sympathy\n    And respite coordination should be systematic, not ad hoc\n\n  Scenario: Sibling coordination for mother's care to prevent overwhelming James\n    Given James's siblings also have responsibility for their mother\n    And James is already overwhelmed with David's care\n    When the family_elohim tracks sibling care contributions\n    Then it should ensure siblings share mother's care equitably\n    And it should prevent care from defaulting entirely to James\n    And it should coordinate among siblings for fair distribution\n    And James's dual burden should not excuse siblings from contributing\n    And family care should be distributed based on capacity\n\n  Scenario: Family cultural recognition of caregiving as sacred work\n    Given some cultural traditions honor caregiving as sacred\n    And family culture may recognize James's care work meaningfully\n    When the family_elohim tracks cultural care values\n    Then it should recognize cultural frameworks that honor caregiving\n    And it should support family cultural practices around care\n    And cultural recognition should supplement economic recognition\n    And diverse family cultures should be respected and valued\n    And care economy should align with family cultural values\n",
