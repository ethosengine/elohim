  "content": "@epic:value_scanner\n@user_type:teen\n@governance_layer:educational\n@related_users:preteen,young_adult,parent,student,worker\n@related_layers:individual,family,community\n@elohim_agents:personal_agent,educational_elohim\n\nFeature: Educational Layer Value Recognition for Teen\n  As a teen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want my formal education to integrate with care economy learning\n  So that I build comprehensive value literacy and understand education as care work\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teen user \"Jasmine\" is registered in the system\n    And Jasmine is 16 years old and in high school\n    And the educational governance context is active\n    And educational_elohim coordinates between formal education and care economy\n    And Jasmine's personal_agent integrates learning across contexts\n\n  Scenario: Teen learns comprehensive value literacy through integrated education\n    Given Jasmine is learning economics in school\n    And she practices care economy through Value Scanner daily\n    When her educational_elohim integrates these learning contexts\n    Then she should understand both market economics and care economics\n    And learn how care creates value beyond market exchange\n    And develop sophisticated analysis of invisible labor\n    And understand household economics, care work recognition, and community participation\n    And build foundation for adult economic capability\n    And recognize limitations of market-only economic thinking\n\n  Scenario: Applied learning through care economy translates to academic credit\n    Given Jasmine manages household budget and coordinates care work\n    And these activities involve mathematical reasoning, planning, and analysis\n    When educational_elohim analyzes her care economy participation\n    Then it should identify applicable learning in her care work\n    And surface opportunities for academic recognition\n    And connect to teachers: \"Jasmine's budget management demonstrates applied math skills\"\n    And support translation of care contributions into academic credit where appropriate\n    And recognize that learning happens across contexts, not just in classrooms\n    And validate that care work develops genuine capabilities\n\n  Scenario: Educational resources accessible based on care contributions\n    Given Jasmine has accumulated care tokens through contributions\n    And the community offers educational programs and tutoring\n    When she seeks additional educational support\n    Then her care tokens should be convertible to educational access\n    And she should be able to use care economy participation to access learning resources\n    And educational opportunities should not be limited to those who can pay market rates\n    And her demonstrated contribution should give her standing to access education\n    And care economy should support educational equity\n    And reduce barriers to educational access for contributing community members\n\n  Scenario: Teen understands education itself as care work\n    Given Jasmine invests time and effort in her education\n    And education develops capability to serve future flourishing\n    When educational_elohim frames her learning\n    Then education should be understood as care work for her future self\n    And investment in capability building should be recognized as care labor\n    And she should learn that education serves collective as well as individual good\n    And understand that her developing capabilities will serve community needs\n    And see education as part of care economy, not separate from it\n    And internalize that learning is valuable beyond market return\n\n  Scenario: Career planning integrated with care economy principles\n    Given Jasmine is exploring career pathways\n    And her personal_agent serves as career counselor\n    When she researches potential careers\n    Then the agent should help her analyze careers through care economy lens\n    And surface how different careers contribute to collective flourishing\n    And explore: \"How does this work serve others? What care does it provide?\"\n    And connect her care economy values to career choices\n    And help her identify careers aligned with her demonstrated care patterns\n    And support her finding work that is meaningful, not just remunerative\n\n  Scenario: Educational institutions recognize teen care contributions\n    Given Jasmine volunteers extensively while maintaining academic work\n    And educational institutions value \"well-rounded\" students\n    When her school evaluates her holistically\n    Then educational_elohim should make her care contributions visible\n    And provide comprehensive view of her capabilities beyond grades\n    And colleges should see her substantial care economy participation\n    And recognize leadership demonstrated through care work\n    And value care contributions alongside academic and extracurricular achievements\n    And support her access to educational opportunities based on comprehensive participation\n\n  Scenario: Peer collaboration framed as care economy practice\n    Given Jasmine collaborates with classmates on group projects\n    And peer learning is valuable educational practice\n    When educational_elohim tracks collaborative learning\n    Then it should frame peer collaboration as care economy\n    And recognize that students teaching each other is care work\n    And value collaborative learning as mutual care\n    And help students understand that knowledge sharing creates collective value\n    And build expectation that learning is community practice, not individual competition\n    And demonstrate care economy principles in educational contexts\n\n  Scenario: Financial literacy education grounded in real practice\n    Given Jasmine manages real budgets and makes real economic decisions\n    And school provides financial literacy education\n    When educational_elohim integrates school learning with lived experience\n    Then abstract financial concepts should connect to her real practice\n    And she should learn budgeting through managing actual household budget\n    And understand compound interest through her real college savings\n    And learn financial planning by making real financial plans\n    And develop sophisticated financial capability through practice, not just theory\n    And integrate formal education with applied learning\n\n  Scenario: Teen's educational needs supported by community care economy\n    Given Jasmine needs school supplies, technology access, and learning resources\n    And she has contributed to community care economy\n    When educational needs arise\n    Then community care tokens should be usable for educational resources\n    And community_elohim should coordinate support for her educational success\n    And her care contributions should connect to educational opportunity\n    And barriers to education should be reduced through care economy networks\n    And community investment in her education should reflect her community contribution\n    And mutual care should extend to supporting each other's learning\n\n  Scenario: Educational policy informed by teen care economy participation\n    Given aggregate data shows how teens balance education with care work\n    And many teens provide substantial household labor while in school\n    When educational_elohim analyzes patterns across student populations\n    Then it should surface insights about care work burden on students\n    And inform educational policy about homework loads and scheduling\n    And show how household responsibilities affect educational outcomes\n    And advocate for policies that recognize student care economy participation\n    And push schools to consider whole lives of students, not just academic performance\n    And support evidence-based educational policy grounded in student realities\n\n  Scenario: Learning across contexts builds coherent knowledge\n    Given Jasmine learns in school, at work, in family, and in community\n    And knowledge fragments across contexts\n    When her personal_agent integrates learning from all contexts\n    Then she should see connections: \"Your work customer service builds communication skills valuable in all contexts\"\n    And understand how different learning experiences reinforce each other\n    And develop coherent knowledge rather than fragmented skills\n    And learn to translate capabilities across contexts\n    And build sophisticated understanding through integrated experience\n    And maintain coherent identity while navigating multiple learning environments\n\n  Scenario: Educational aspirations supported through care economy networks\n    Given Jasmine aspires to attend college\n    And she has accumulated care tokens through years of contribution\n    When she applies to colleges and seeks financial support\n    Then her care contributions should support her educational transition\n    And care tokens should be convertible to educational resources\n    And community letters of support should reflect her demonstrated care work\n    And care economy network should provide mentorship and guidance\n    And her path to higher education should be supported by those she has served\n    And care economy should enable educational mobility based on contribution\n",
