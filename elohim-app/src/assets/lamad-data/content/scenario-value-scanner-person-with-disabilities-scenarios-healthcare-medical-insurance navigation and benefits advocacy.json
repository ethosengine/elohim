  "content": "Scenario: Insurance navigation and benefits advocacy\n    Given disability-related medical costs are substantial\n    And insurance systems are complex and often deny coverage\n    When Alex navigates insurance systems\n    Then the personal_agent should help Alex understand insurance benefits\n    And it should track what's covered and what's been denied\n    And it should support Alex in appeals processes\n    And it should document medical necessity for needed services\n    And Alex should have support in fighting insurance denials\n    And the protocol should reduce insurance navigation burden\n    And Alex should be able to access needed care despite insurance barriers\n",
