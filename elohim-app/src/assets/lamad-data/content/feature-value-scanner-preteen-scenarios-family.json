Family Layer Value Recognition for Preteen\n  As a preteen in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want my substantial care contributions to be visible to my family\n  So that I am recognized as a junior partner in family governance while preventing parentification damage\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the preteen user \"Marcus\" is registered in the system\n    And Marcus is part of a family with mother Sarah and sister Keisha (age 7)\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim is coordinating family care economy\n    And Marcus operates as junior partner in family governance\n    And Sarah works two jobs with limited availability\n\n  Scenario: Preteen's care work made visible with appropriate recognition\n    Given Marcus has completed weekly grocery shopping\n    And he has managed budget, nutrition, and meal planning\n    When the family_elohim processes Marcus's contributions\n    Then his care work should be visible on family dashboard\n    And Sarah should receive specific recognition prompts\n    And the prompt should detail \"Marcus managed $75 budget, maintained 92% nutrition, planned 21 meals\"\n    And care tokens should reflect genuine economic value of his work\n    And recognition should communicate that this is substantial labor\n    And Sarah should be prompted to acknowledge his capability\n    And Marcus should feel valued as major family contributor\n\n  Scenario: Operating as junior partner in family governance\n    Given Marcus makes real decisions about family resources\n    And Sarah maintains ultimate parental authority\n    When family governance decisions are made\n    Then Marcus should be treated as junior partner, not dependent\n    And his judgment should be increasingly trusted\n    And the family_elohim should coordinate their partnership\n    And Marcus's autonomy should grow with demonstrated capability\n    And Sarah should maintain oversight without micromanaging\n    And the balance should reflect his developmental stage\n    And partnership model should prevent both parentification and infantilization\n\n  Scenario: Mother's oversight calibrated to preteen's capability\n    Given Sarah works two jobs with limited time\n    And she needs to trust Marcus while maintaining responsibility\n    When Sarah monitors Marcus's scanner usage\n    Then she should have full visibility into his activities\n    And the family_elohim should alert her when Marcus needs support\n    And she should be informed of nutrition concerns or budget crises\n    And routine successes should be summarized to build her confidence\n    And the system should help her calibrate autonomy levels appropriately\n    And she should not experience constant anxiety about delegating responsibility\n    And trust should be built through visible competence\n\n  Scenario: Care for sibling recognized without enabling parentification\n    Given Marcus cares for Keisha age 7\n    And he manages her meals and nutritional needs\n    When Marcus makes care decisions for Keisha\n    Then his care work should be tracked by family_elohim\n    And the system should recognize legitimate care contributions\n    And it should also watch for parentification damage\n    And Keisha should be prompted to appreciate Marcus's work\n    And the protocol should prevent Keisha from taking Marcus for granted\n    And family_elohim should help maintain sibling dynamics alongside care reality\n    And Marcus should be supported, not exploited\n\n  Scenario: Tracking nutritional needs across family members\n    Given Marcus is responsible for feeding himself and Keisha\n    And Keisha has specific dietary needs and preferences\n    When Marcus plans meals and shops\n    Then the personal_agent should track both their nutritional requirements\n    And it should alert Marcus to Keisha's needs: \"Keisha needs more iron this week\"\n    And it should help him find affordable foods that meet her requirements\n    And age-appropriate nutrition for both should be maintained\n    And Marcus should have tools to ensure Keisha's healthy development\n    And nutritional tracking should prevent inadequate diet\n\n  Scenario: Family care tokens reflect preteen's substantial contributions\n    Given the family participates in care token economy\n    And Marcus performs significant household labor\n    When family care tokens are calculated\n    Then Marcus's contributions should be valued at realistic rates\n    And tokens should reflect that his work would be compensated if adult performed it\n    And family care token total should include his contributions\n    And tokens should qualify family for community resource access\n    And Marcus's demonstrated stewardship should be evidence of family capability\n    And care economy should channel support to families like Marcus's\n\n  Scenario: Preventing household stress from breaking family bonds\n    Given Sarah is stretched thin across two jobs\n    And Marcus carries substantial household responsibility\n    When family stress levels are high\n    Then the family_elohim should monitor for relationship strain\n    And it should facilitate communication between Marcus and Sarah\n    And it should prompt Sarah to recognize Marcus's work\n    And it should connect family to support resources before crisis\n    And the protocol should prevent stress from damaging their bond\n    And care visibility should make burden manageable\n    And support should flow to prevent family breakdown\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating care across limited parental availability\n    Given Sarah's work schedule limits her availability\n    And Marcus manages daily household operations\n    When coordination is needed between them\n    Then the family_elohim should facilitate asynchronous communication\n    And Sarah should be able to provide guidance during her available hours\n    And Marcus should be able to request help when needed\n    And the system should ensure Sarah stays informed despite time constraints\n    And coordination should happen efficiently without constant interruption\n    And their partnership should function despite scheduling challenges\n\n  Scenario: Budget crisis triggers appropriate intervention\n    Given Marcus manages $75 weekly budget\n    And unexpected expenses could create crisis\n    When budget becomes unsustainable\n    Then the family_elohim should alert Sarah immediately\n    And it should connect family to emergency resources\n    And crisis intervention should preserve Marcus's dignity\n    And the system should prevent budget failure from becoming catastrophic\n    And support should be framed through care economy, not charity\n    And Marcus should not feel responsible for systemic poverty\n\n  Scenario: Family decision making includes preteen's substantial input\n    Given Marcus has real knowledge of household needs and constraints\n    And he manages daily household operations\n    When family decisions about resources are made\n    Then Marcus's input should carry genuine weight\n    And his knowledge should inform family planning\n    And the family_elohim should surface his insights to Sarah\n    And his voice should be respected as informed perspective\n    And family governance should reflect that he has legitimate standing\n    And his participation should be meaningful, not token\n\n  Scenario: Preserving developmentally appropriate family structure\n    Given Marcus has adult-level responsibilities\n    And he is still a 12-year-old child\n    When family dynamics are shaped by care economy\n    Then the family_elohim should work to preserve appropriate boundaries\n    And Marcus should not become de facto parent\n    And Sarah should remain ultimate authority and protector\n    And age-appropriate childhood should be preserved where possible\n    And the protocol should prevent role reversal damage\n    And family structure should remain as healthy as circumstances allow\n\n  Scenario: Recognition prompts build mother-son relationship\n    Given Sarah has limited time with Marcus\n    And their relationship could be strained by her absence and his burden\n    When the family_elohim generates recognition prompts\n    Then prompts should facilitate positive connection moments\n    And Sarah should be given specific appreciations to express\n    And Marcus should receive recognition from Sarah, not just system\n    And their relationship should be strengthened by care visibility\n    And prompts should create opportunities for bonding\n    And love should be communicated despite difficult circumstances\n",
