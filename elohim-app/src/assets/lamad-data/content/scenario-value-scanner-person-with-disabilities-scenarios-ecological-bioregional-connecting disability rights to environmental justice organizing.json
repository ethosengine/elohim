  "content": "Scenario: Connecting disability rights to environmental justice organizing\n    Given both movements challenge systems that devalue certain lives\n    And both require recognizing interdependence and collective care\n    When Alex participates in environmental organizing\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should facilitate cross-movement solidarity\n    And it should help Alex build bridges between disability and environmental movements\n    And it should make visible shared principles and goals\n    And coalition-building should be supported and valued\n    And Alex's work connecting movements should accumulate care tokens\n    And the protocol should recognize that these justices are interconnected\n    And Alex's bridge-building strengthens both movements\n",
