  "content": "Scenario: Operator discovers solidarity with workers through shared recognition of exploitation\n    Given James and workers both resented each other due to structural positions\n    And conversion reveals corporate extracted from both operator and workers\n    When honest accounting shows parallel victimization\n    Then unexpected solidarity emerges from recognizing common enemy (corporate)\n    And workers learn James netted modest income after corporate extraction and debt service\n    And James learns workers created value he attributed to his management\n    And mutual antagonism transforms to mutual respect through honest accounting\n    And workplace_elohim facilitates shared recognition of dual exploitation\n",
