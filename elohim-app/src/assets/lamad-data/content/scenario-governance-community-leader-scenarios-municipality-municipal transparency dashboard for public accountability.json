  "content": "Scenario: Municipal transparency dashboard for public accountability\n    Given residents deserve visibility into city governance\n    And I am accountable through democratic elections\n    When we provide municipal transparency dashboard\n    Then residents see: resource flows across neighborhoods\n    And they access: appeal patterns and council decisions\n    And they view: city budget allocation and outcomes\n    And they compare: promised benefits with actual results\n    And they hold me accountable: with evidence not just rhetoric\n    And transparency strengthens: democratic governance\n    And I cannot hide: behind \"algorithm decided\" or \"trust me\"\n",
