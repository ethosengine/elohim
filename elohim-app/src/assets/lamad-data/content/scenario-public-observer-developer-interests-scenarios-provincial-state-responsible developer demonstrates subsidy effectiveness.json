  "content": "Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates subsidy effectiveness\n    Given a responsible developer builds genuinely affordable housing\n    And uses state subsidies to serve low-income residents\n    When the Observer tracks development outcomes against state investment\n    Then analysis shows: 180 units meet affordability criteria from $8M subsidy\n    And residents are actually low-income workforce families\n    And units remain affordable through long-term deed restrictions\n    And state investment created genuine community benefit\n    And responsible development gains advantage in subsidy allocation\n",
