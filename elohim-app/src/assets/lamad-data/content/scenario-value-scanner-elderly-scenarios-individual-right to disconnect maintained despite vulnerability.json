  "content": "Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained despite vulnerability\n    Given Helen is elderly and vulnerable\n    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers\n    When Helen or her designated advocate chooses to disconnect\n    Then the system must honor disconnection immediately\n    And no manipulative retention patterns should be employed\n    And her right to refuse participation must be absolute\n    And vulnerability does not diminish constitutional rights\n    And data deletion must occur per her instructions\n    And autonomy includes the right to reject the protocol entirely\n",
