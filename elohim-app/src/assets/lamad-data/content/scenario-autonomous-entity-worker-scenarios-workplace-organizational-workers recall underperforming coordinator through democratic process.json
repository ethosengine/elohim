  "content": "Scenario: Workers recall underperforming coordinator through democratic process\n    Given Marcus transitioned from manager to democratic coordinator\n    And workers have expressed concerns about his facilitation effectiveness\n    When workers initiate a recall process\n    Then workplace_elohim facilitates a fair evaluation process\n    And Marcus receives specific feedback on coordination failures\n    And workers vote on recall with 2/3 supermajority required\n    And if recalled, Marcus transitions gracefully with support for next role\n    And democratic accountability prevents hierarchical abuse\n",
