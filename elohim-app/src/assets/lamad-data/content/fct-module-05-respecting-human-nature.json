We have evolved heuristics\u2014or shortcuts\u2014for making decisions, for everything from the way we process information to the way we relate to others around us. These heuristics developed for an evolutionary purpose: usually to keep us alive, healthy, and reproducing.\n\nBut those heuristics don\u2019t always work in our favor. In situations where they lead us astray, the heuristics become cognitive biases, which can easily be manipulated and exploited.  \nEach and every human lives with a brain that is subject to these forces. So, technology that takes advantage of these heuristics affects everyone. This is why humane technology is so important. Instead of exploiting these biases for short-term profits, humane technology uses them as design constraints for wise choices. \n\nWhen we discuss risks tied to artificial intelligence we often fear the moment when machines become smarter than us: the moment when they overwhelm human strengths. But there is an earlier moment\u2014one we\u2019ve already passed\u2014when artificial intelligence overwhelms human weaknesses.\n\n### Bible Reference(s)\n\nDeuteronomy 11: \"lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. \"        \n\nRevelation 3:20, \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me\"\n\n\"Consider Jesus, focus your attention,\". Hebrews 3:1 ESV  \n\\[1\\] Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.\n\n\"Note what we set our sites on things above, but this is not just a mindset, but the embodiment of this in the world\". Colossians 3:1-3, 12-13 ESV  \n\\[1\\] If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. \\[2\\] Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. \\[3\\] For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.  \n\\[12\\] Put on then, as God\u2019s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, \\[13\\] bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.\n\n### Story \n\nBiblical Example of Sacred Attention: Mary and Martha  \nThe story of Mary and Martha, found in Luke 10:38-42, provides a powerful illustration of the importance of giving our attention to what truly matters:\n\nAs Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, \"Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me\\!\"  \n\"Martha, Martha,\" the Lord answered, \"you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed\u2014or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nFocused Attention: Mary demonstrates the value of giving undivided attention to what's most important. In this case, she focuses on Jesus' teachings, recognizing the rare opportunity to learn from him directly.  \nResisting Distractions: While Martha becomes \"distracted by all the preparations,\" Mary resists the pull of these seemingly important tasks to focus on something of greater value.  \nPrioritizing Spiritual Growth: Mary's choice to sit at Jesus' feet and listen shows her prioritization of spiritual growth and relationship over mundane tasks.  \nJesus' Affirmation: Jesus affirms Mary's choice, stating that she \"has chosen what is better.\" This divine endorsement underscores the importance of giving our attention to spiritual matters.  \nLong-term Perspective: Jesus notes that what Mary has chosen \"will not be taken away from her,\" highlighting the lasting value of attention given to spiritual truths.\n\nRelevance to Sacred Attention  \nThis story beautifully illustrates the concept of attention as sacred. In our modern context, we are constantly pulled in multiple directions by various tasks, notifications, and demands on our time \\- much like Martha was distracted by her many preparations. However, this story reminds us of the importance of intentionally directing our attention to what truly matters.  \nFor Christians working in technology, this story serves as a powerful reminder to design systems that respect the sacredness of human attention. It encourages us to create technologies that help users focus on what's truly important, rather than constantly distracting them with the digital equivalent of \"many preparations.\"\n\n### Discussion Question or Activity\n\nTry to map out an experience that you seek to create with technology, using the Humane Tech Design Guide. If you don\u2019t have a specific product to use in this exercise, pick an existing product from any company.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur Attention is Sacred  \nWe\u2019ll never be unencumbered by our biases in cognition and perception; it\u2019s part of being human.  \nMany of the challenges humans face are unprecedented in scope. Mitigating catastrophic risks requires increases in the capacity to collaborate and imagine viable solutions to wicked problems.  \nWe need technology that helps us be wiser as individuals and as a civilization.
