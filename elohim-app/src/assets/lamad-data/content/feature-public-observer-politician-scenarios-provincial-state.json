State Legislature Governance for Elected Representative\n  As a politician in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer\n  I want to understand statewide patterns and policy impacts\n  So that I can legislate effectively for millions of constituents despite lobbying pressure and complexity\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the politician user is registered in the system\n    And the provincial_state governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: State legislator surfaces constituent priorities across diverse district\n    Given the politician represents 200,000 residents across urban and rural areas\n    And hears disproportionately from organized lobbying campaigns\n    When the Observer aggregates constituent intelligence\n    Then they see healthcare affordability is top concern across demographics\n    And identify rural transportation barriers affecting economic opportunity\n    And learn working families struggle with childcare costs statewide\n    And understand constituent priorities beyond lobbying group demands\n    And align legislative agenda with actual community needs\n\n  Scenario: Legislator evaluates major bill with comprehensive impact analysis\n    Given education reform legislation has 200 pages\n    And supporters present optimistic outcomes while opponents predict disaster\n    When the Observer provides evidence-based impact analysis\n    Then they see how similar legislation performed in other states\n    And understand fiscal impacts on districts with different demographics\n    And identify which students benefit versus harmed by changes\n    And review educator and parent perspectives from constituent communities\n    And make informed vote beyond partisan talking points\n\n  Scenario: State legislator tracks accountability for legislative commitments\n    Given the politician co-sponsored criminal justice reform bill\n    And committed to reducing incarceration rates\n    When the Observer monitors policy implementation\n    Then they see whether state agencies implement legislative intent\n    And track incarceration trends after legislation passage\n    And identify bureaucratic resistance to reform\n    And receive alerts when outcomes diverge from expectations\n    And intervene to ensure legislation achieves intended impact\n\n  Scenario: Legislator distinguishes constituent calls from corporate astroturf\n    Given the politician's office receives 500 calls opposing regulation\n    And callers claim to be concerned constituents\n    When the Observer analyzes campaign origins\n    Then they see calls coordinated by corporate lobbying firm\n    And identify script language and coordinated timing\n    And distinguish 12 genuine constituent concerns from 488 manufactured contacts\n    And understand industry opposition versus authentic community sentiment\n    And vote based on constituent interests not manufactured pressure\n\n  Scenario: State legislator builds coalition for statewide healthcare reform\n    Given the politician champions Medicaid expansion\n    And needs bipartisan support for passage\n    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities\n    Then they see rural hospitals support expansion for financial survival\n    And identify business groups concerned about employee healthcare costs\n    And connect with faith organizations serving uninsured populations\n    And map which legislators have constituent pressure for expansion\n    And build diverse coalition across partisan and geographic divides\n\n  Scenario: Legislator exposes statewide funding formula creating district inequities\n    Given education funding formula creates disparities\n    When the Observer analyzes statewide funding patterns\n    Then they see low-income districts receive $3,000 less per student\n    And identify property tax base driving inequitable outcomes\n    And connect families in underfunded districts across state\n    And compare state formula to more equitable models in other states\n    And champion funding reform with comprehensive evidence\n\n  Scenario: State legislator verifies industry claims about regulation impacts\n    Given business lobbyists claim environmental regulation will destroy jobs\n    And present alarming economic analysis\n    When the Observer fact-checks industry projections\n    Then they see similar regulations in other states\n    And review actual employment impacts versus predicted job losses\n    And identify which industries comply without job losses\n    And understand costs of inaction (health impacts, environmental damage)\n    And resist fear-mongering with evidence-based policy analysis\n\n  Scenario: Legislator monitors state agency implementation across departments\n    Given the politician passed legislation affecting multiple agencies\n    When the Observer tracks implementation statewide\n    Then they see which agencies comply with legislative intent\n    And identify bureaucratic resistance to policy changes\n    And understand regional variation in policy implementation\n    And learn where additional legislative oversight is needed\n    And ensure legislative authority translates to executive action\n\n  Scenario: State legislator understands local impacts of statewide policy\n    Given the politician represents specific legislative district\n    And considers statewide legislation\n    When the Observer analyzes district-specific impacts\n    Then they see how legislation affects their constituents specifically\n    And identify trade-offs between district and statewide interests\n    And understand which constituent communities benefit versus harmed\n    And explain vote to constituents with local impact data\n    And balance representation of district versus state interests\n\n  Scenario: Legislator faces donor pressure with transparency and accountability\n    Given the politician received campaign contributions from industry\n    And industry lobbyists seek favorable vote on regulation\n    When the Observer documents relationship and voting patterns\n    Then they see campaign finance connections made publicly visible\n    And understand constituents track alignment of votes with donors\n    And face accountability for voting with industry versus constituents\n    And explain votes with policy rationale not donor influence\n    And navigate pressure with transparent evidence-based decision-making\n",
