Municipal Economic Development Through Democratic Business Conversion\n  As a small_business_owner in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the municipality governance layer\n  I want my business conversion to contribute to citywide economic democracy\n  So that municipal policy supports democratic ownership and other owners can follow\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And Rosa's Auto Repair conversion is part of emerging municipal democratic economy\n    And the municipality governance context is active\n    And municipal government is beginning to recognize worker ownership benefits\n\n  Scenario: Successful conversion demonstrates viability to municipal economic development officials\n    Given city economic development typically subsidizes corporate expansion\n    And officials are skeptical of alternative ownership models\n    When Rosa's conversion proves successful with documented outcomes\n    Then municipality sees concrete evidence: workers earning living wages without subsidies\n    And job quality improves (higher wages, benefits, ownership) without tax breaks\n    And community institution is preserved, not destroyed by corporate acquisition\n    And municipal economic development data shows democratic ownership creates better outcomes\n    And municipality_elohim provides officials with impact documentation\n\n  Scenario: Municipal business licensing and regulation adapt to democratic ownership\n    Given regulations were designed for traditional hierarchical businesses\n    And democratic governance may not fit standard regulatory categories\n    When Rosa's Auto navigates municipal licensing as democratic enterprise\n    Then business license accurately reflects worker-owned cooperative structure\n    And regulatory compliance is streamlined for democratic businesses\n    And municipal officials learn how to support rather than obstruct conversions\n    And regulatory framework evolves to accommodate democratic governance\n    And municipality_elohim coordinates with officials to develop supportive policies\n\n  Scenario: City procurement policies begin prioritizing democratic businesses\n    Given municipality purchases vehicles and services from private vendors\n    And public procurement can support democratic economy development\n    When Rosa's Auto bids for city fleet maintenance contracts\n    Then municipal procurement gives preference to worker-owned businesses\n    And democratic enterprises compete successfully for public contracts\n    And taxpayer money supports living wages and community wealth, not corporate extraction\n    And procurement policy changes demonstrate municipal commitment to economic democracy\n    And municipality_elohim tracks procurement impacts on democratic business viability\n\n  Scenario: Municipal tax revenue stability increases through worker ownership\n    Given small business failure drains municipal tax base\n    And worker-owned businesses show higher survival rates and stability\n    When Rosa's conversion demonstrates enhanced business sustainability\n    Then municipality experiences more stable tax revenue from democratic businesses\n    And higher worker wages generate increased income tax revenue\n    And business continuity maintains property tax base\n    And city fiscal planners recognize democratic ownership reduces revenue volatility\n    And municipality_elohim documents tax revenue benefits for policy advocacy\n\n  Scenario: Owner advocates for municipal policies supporting exit-to-community conversions\n    Given Rosa's successful transition positions her as credible advocate\n    And municipal policy could support or obstruct future conversions\n    When Rosa testifies to city council about conversion benefits\n    Then her personal story demonstrates exit-to-community is dignified and viable\n    And she advocates for: business conversion support programs and community investment tax credits\n    And city council hears directly from small business owner who chose democratic path\n    And her advocacy influences municipal economic development strategy\n    And municipality_elohim coordinates advocate network across converted owners\n\n  Scenario: Municipal small business support programs incorporate democratic conversion pathways\n    Given city offers small business loans, technical assistance, and development support\n    And these programs could facilitate democratic conversions\n    When municipality recognizes conversion potential for struggling businesses\n    Then small business support programs add worker ownership conversion option\n    And struggling owners learn they can exit with dignity while protecting workers\n    And municipal economic development staff are trained in democratic transition support\n    And public resources help overcome conversion barriers (legal costs, financing, technical assistance)\n    And municipality_elohim provides conversion expertise to municipal programs\n\n  Scenario: Citywide democratic business network emerges from successful conversions\n    Given Rosa's conversion inspires other small business owners\n    And isolated democratic businesses are vulnerable\n    When multiple conversions create critical mass across municipality\n    Then democratic business network provides mutual support and coordination\n    And owners considering conversion can learn from Rosa and others\n    And network advocates collectively for supportive municipal policies\n    And citywide democratic economy infrastructure develops (shared services, coordination, advocacy)\n    And municipality_elohim facilitates network development and coordination\n\n  Scenario: Municipal economic development metrics expand beyond job quantity to job quality\n    Given cities typically measure economic development by jobs created\n    And job quality (wages, benefits, dignity, ownership) is often ignored\n    When Rosa's conversion demonstrates high-quality job creation\n    Then municipality tracks worker ownership, living wages, and benefits in economic development data\n    And democratic conversions score highly on job quality metrics\n    And city economic development strategy prioritizes quality over quantity\n    And officials recognize one living-wage worker-owner job exceeds three poverty-wage positions\n    And municipality_elohim provides quality-focused metrics and documentation\n\n  Scenario: Local financial institutions develop lending products for democratic conversions\n    Given banks lack experience financing worker ownership transitions\n    And conversion financing barriers limit democratic economy growth\n    When Rosa's successful conversion demonstrates creditworthiness of democratic model\n    Then local banks and credit unions develop conversion lending products\n    And community development financial institutions (CDFIs) prioritize democratic business\n    And municipal policy supports conversion lending through guarantees or partnerships\n    And financial infrastructure emerges for scaling democratic conversions citywide\n    And municipality_elohim coordinates with financial institutions on product development\n\n  Scenario: Municipal land use and zoning protect community businesses from displacement\n    Given commercial real estate speculation threatens community institutions\n    And Rosa's Auto could face displacement through rising rents or property sale\n    When democratic ownership is recognized as community benefit\n    Then zoning policies prioritize long-term community business tenancy\n    And city explores community land trusts for commercial space\n    And democratic businesses receive preference in publicly-owned commercial properties\n    And land use policy protects against speculation displacing community institutions\n    And municipality_elohim advocates for commercial anti-displacement policies\n\n  Scenario: City celebrates democratic conversions as municipal economic development success\n    Given economic development announcements typically celebrate corporate recruitment\n    And democratic conversions deserve equal municipal recognition\n    When Rosa's conversion and others reach significant milestones\n    Then mayor and city council publicly celebrate worker ownership transitions\n    And municipal communications highlight democratic economy as development strategy\n    And public celebration builds community awareness and political support\n    And recognition encourages other small business owners to consider conversion\n    And municipality_elohim coordinates celebration events amplifying democratic economy visibility\n\n  Scenario: Municipal workforce development integrates democratic business training\n    Given city workforce programs train workers for traditional employment\n    And democratic governance requires different skills (facilitation, collaboration, shared decision-making)\n    When municipality recognizes democratic businesses need prepared workers\n    Then workforce development programs include cooperative business training\n    And workers learn democratic governance skills alongside technical skills\n    And community colleges offer worker ownership and democratic management courses\n    And municipal investment in workforce development supports democratic economy growth\n    And municipality_elohim develops democratic business curriculum for workforce programs\n",
