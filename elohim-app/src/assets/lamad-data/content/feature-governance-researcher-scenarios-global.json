Global-Level Governance Research for Researcher\n  As a researcher in the governance system\n  Operating at the global governance layer\n  I want to study protocol adoption and governance across all humanity\n  So that I can understand universal patterns and cultural variations in democratic AI\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the researcher user is registered in the system\n    And the global governance context is active\n    And Dr. James Chen participates in global research networks\n\n  Scenario: Global research network coordinating cross-cultural studies\n    Given protocol has been adopted in diverse nations worldwide\n    And I am part of international research consortium\n    When we coordinate parallel studies across continents\n    Then we examine: how cultural context shapes constitutional interpretation\n    And we compare: collectivist vs individualist societies' implementations\n    And we analyze: different political systems' integration patterns\n    And we identify: universal patterns vs cultural adaptations\n    And we share: methodologies and data (with appropriate protection)\n    And we test: whether democratic AI governance is Western innovation or universal possibility\n    And Our global collaboration reveals: humanity's shared and diverse governance approaches\n\n  Scenario: Analyzing Global Constitutional Convention deliberations\n    Given 10,000 randomly-selected global citizens convene every 7 years\n    And this is unprecedented experiment in planetary democracy\n    When I study the Global Constitutional Convention process\n    Then I examine: how citizens from radically different contexts deliberate together\n    And I analyze: what enables agreement despite profound disagreement\n    And I assess: quality of translation and cross-cultural understanding\n    And I explore: how amendments emerge from global collective wisdom\n    And I identify: power dynamics (Global North vs South, wealthy vs poor)\n    And I investigate: whether global sortition can produce legitimate law\n    And My research reveals: possibilities and limits of planetary democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Comparative analysis of protocol adoption across 100+ nations\n    Given protocol has different adoption rates and outcomes globally\n    And I want to understand what predicts success across contexts\n    When I analyze adoption patterns and outcomes worldwide\n    Then I examine: economic factors (wealth, inequality, development stage)\n    And I assess: political factors (democracy, authoritarianism, stability)\n    And I explore: cultural factors (individualism, trust, religious tradition)\n    And I identify: historical factors (colonialism, technology access, institutional quality)\n    And I analyze: which factors are necessary, sufficient, or contingent\n    And My comparative research identifies: pathways to democratic AI governance\n    And Findings inform: international development and adoption strategies\n\n  Scenario: Studying global inequality in protocol access and benefits\n    Given I hypothesize protocol might exacerbate global inequality\n    And wealthy nations can afford infrastructure poor nations cannot\n    When I analyze distributional effects at global scale\n    Then I examine: adoption rates by national income and infrastructure\n    And I assess: whether benefits flow primarily to Global North\n    And I measure: whether protocol reduces or increases global inequality\n    And I explore: mechanisms of digital colonialism or democratic leveling\n    And I identify: barriers preventing equitable global adoption\n    And I advocate: for international funding and technology transfer\n    And My research serves: global justice by revealing inequities\n\n  Scenario: Historical and comparative analysis contextualizing protocol\n    Given I want to understand what's genuinely novel vs reinventing wheels\n    And I study governance history and comparative political theory\n    When I contextualize Elohim Protocol in historical perspective\n    Then I compare: to Athenian democracy's sortition practices\n    And I examine: medieval communes' participatory governance\n    And I analyze: modern citizens' assemblies and deliberative innovations\n    And I explore: attempts to govern non-human powerful systems (corporations, markets)\n    And I identify: what ancient wisdom applies and what's unprecedented\n    And I assess: whether humanity has governed comparable complexity before\n    And My historical analysis reveals: patterns and lessons across millennia\n\n  Scenario: Global data infrastructure with privacy and sovereignty protection\n    Given I need access to data across nations for research\n    And I must respect privacy, sovereignty, and data justice\n    When global research infrastructure is designed\n    Then I work with: federated data systems respecting national sovereignty\n    And I use: differential privacy protecting individual anonymity\n    And I ensure: community data ownership and benefit sharing\n    And I implement: ethical review and consent protocols\n    And I advocate: for open access to research findings\n    And I practice: data justice not data colonialism\n    And My methodology demonstrates: how to study globally while respecting locally\n\n  Scenario: Research on protocol as global existential risk mitigation\n    Given superintelligent AI poses existential risk to humanity\n    And I study whether democratic governance can address this risk\n    When I analyze protocol as existential risk mitigation strategy\n    Then I examine: whether constitutional accountability reduces AI risk\n    And I assess: whether sortition prevents elite capture of superintelligence\n    And I explore: whether transparency enables democratic oversight at scale\n    And I analyze: whether recourse mechanisms provide adaptation to unknown risks\n    And I investigate: whether protocol's distributed architecture increases resilience\n    And I conclude: honestly about uncertainties and limitations\n    And My research informs: humanity's response to its most important challenge\n\n  Scenario: Global research ethics and decolonizing methodology\n    Given historical research often extracted from Global South for Global North benefit\n    And I want to practice ethical global research\n    When I design my research methodology and partnerships\n    Then I ensure: local researchers lead studies in their contexts\n    And I practice: equitable benefit sharing and co-authorship\n    And I support: capacity building in Global South institutions\n    And I challenge: Western-centric theories and methods\n    And I listen: to diverse epistemologies and knowledge systems\n    And I acknowledge: positionality and power in research relationships\n    And My practice embodies: research ethics aligned with protocol's dignity principles\n\n  Scenario: Contributing to global public discourse on AI governance\n    Given public understanding shapes political will for democratic AI\n    And I have findings that matter for global deliberation\n    When I engage in global public education and discourse\n    Then I write: accessible articles for general audiences\n    And I give: public lectures explaining research findings\n    And I participate: in media discussions with honesty about uncertainties\n    And I contribute: to democratic deliberation about governance alternatives\n    And I explain: what's at stake, what options exist, what evidence shows\n    And I avoid: false certainty or ideological advocacy\n    And My public engagement serves: informed democratic choice about AI governance\n\n  Scenario: Longitudinal global study tracking generational transformation\n    Given I study whether protocol transforms civic culture across generations\n    And Tommy's generation is growing up with democratic AI governance\n    When I track generational cohorts over 20-30 years\n    Then I examine: civic capacities (constitutional literacy, deliberation skills)\n    And I assess: political participation and democratic engagement\n    And I measure: relationship to AI and technology\n    And I explore: whether growing up with protocol creates different citizenship\n    And I analyze: intergenerational transmission of democratic culture\n    And I investigate: whether protocol's effects compound across generations\n    And My research captures: civilizational transformation over human timescales\n\n  Scenario: Global meta-analysis synthesizing all protocol research\n    Given hundreds of researchers have studied protocol worldwide\n    And I want to synthesize cumulative knowledge\n    When I conduct systematic review and meta-analysis\n    Then I identify: all rigorous studies meeting quality criteria\n    And I synthesize: findings across diverse contexts and methods\n    And I assess: overall evidence about effectiveness and limitations\n    And I examine: publication bias and selective reporting\n    And I identify: gaps in knowledge requiring further research\n    And I provide: comprehensive evidence base for global policy\n    And My meta-analysis serves: evidence-based democratic deliberation at planetary scale\n\n  Scenario: Research on cultural values and constitutional universality\n    Given protocol claims universal minimums while allowing cultural diversity\n    And I question whether \"universal\" reflects Western bias\n    When I study constitutional interpretation across radically different cultures\n    Then I examine: how different traditions understand dignity, care, autonomy\n    And I analyze: whether constitutional principles translate across worldviews\n    And I explore: legitimate cultural variation vs cultural relativism about harm\n    And I identify: truly universal minimums vs culturally specific instantiations\n    And I assess: whether protocol enables pluralism or imposes uniformity\n    And My research informs: global constitutional evolution that honors diversity\n    And Findings shape: how humanity governs together while respecting difference\n\n  Scenario: Presenting research at Global Constitutional Convention\n    Given convention delegates need evidence to inform constitutional decisions\n    And I am invited to present research on sortition effectiveness\n    When I address 10,000 randomly-selected citizens from around the world\n    Then I summarize: what research shows about democratic AI governance\n    And I present: honestly about successes, failures, and uncertainties\n    And I explain: the superintelligence governance legitimacy question\n    And I acknowledge: the limits of my knowledge and research\n    And I clarify: that delegates must make values choices research cannot resolve\n    And I serve: democracy by informing not replacing citizen judgment\n    And My scholarship demonstrates: how expertise serves rather than dominates democracy\n",
