Family Layer Value Recognition for Senior\n  As a senior in early retirement in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want my multigenerational care contributions to be visible and valued\n  So that family care economy operates on reciprocity and recognition, not invisibility\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the senior user \"Margaret\" is registered in the system\n    And Margaret participates in multigenerational family care\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim coordinates family care economy\n    And Margaret has adult children, grandchildren, and an aging mother\n\n  Scenario: Grandchild care contributions made visible to family\n    Given Margaret provides 15 hours/week of grandchild care\n    And this care has market value of approximately $15k/year\n    When the family_elohim tracks Margaret's care contributions\n    Then the care labor should be quantified and visible\n    And her daughter should see specific care contributions\n    And the data should show \"Margaret provided 60 hours of childcare this month\"\n    And the economic value should be calculated and displayed\n    And Margaret's care work should be recognized, not taken for granted\n    And family care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions\n    And genuine appreciation should be enabled through visibility\n\n  Scenario: Reciprocal care flows between Margaret and adult children\n    Given Margaret provides childcare for her daughter's family\n    And her daughter provides technology help and transportation\n    When the family_elohim coordinates these reciprocal care exchanges\n    Then all care flows should be tracked in both directions\n    And Margaret gives care (grandchildren); daughter gives care (support)\n    And reciprocity should be visible to prevent imbalance\n    And both generations' contributions should be valued\n    And the relationship should feel equitable, not one-sided\n    And multigenerational care patterns should be sustainable\n\n  Scenario: Elder care for Margaret's mother made visible and valued\n    Given Margaret provides 8 hours/week care coordination for her mother\n    And Margaret's nursing background makes her care highly skilled\n    When Margaret's elder care contributions are tracked\n    Then the sophisticated care labor should be recognized\n    And the time, skill, and emotional labor should be quantified\n    And Margaret's siblings should see her care contributions\n    And family resource allocation should reflect her caregiving\n    And elder care should be valued as the skilled work it is\n    And Margaret's contributions should give her voice in mother's care decisions\n\n  Scenario: Family care burden monitoring prevents Margaret's burnout\n    Given Margaret provides care across three generations\n    And she has limited time and energy\n    When the family_elohim monitors total care burden\n    Then it should track cumulative care hours across all relationships\n    And it should flag when burden becomes unsustainable\n    And it should surface need for family conversation about distribution\n    And Margaret's own needs should be protected\n    And the system should prevent exploitation disguised as family care\n    And burnout prevention should be built into family coordination\n\n  Scenario: Family decision-making includes Margaret's voice\n    Given Margaret makes substantial contributions to family flourishing\n    And family decisions affect her care capacity\n    When family decisions are being made\n    Then Margaret's care contributions should give her legitimate standing\n    And her voice should carry weight in family governance\n    And decisions should consider impact on her care capacity\n    And Margaret should be respected as autonomous adult contributor\n    And family governance should be multigenerational and equitable\n    And her retirement doesn't diminish her authority in family\n\n  Scenario: Teaching and mentoring grandchildren as valued care work\n    Given Margaret provides not just childcare but teaching and mentoring\n    And she's passing on knowledge, values, and skills\n    When the family_elohim tracks educational care contributions\n    Then it should recognize teaching as distinct care category\n    And it should track skill-building and mentoring activities\n    And the long-term value of grandparent teaching should be recognized\n    And Margaret's role in grandchildren's development should be visible\n    And intergenerational knowledge transmission should be valued\n    And cultural/family traditions taught by Margaret should be tracked\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating Margaret's mother's care among siblings\n    Given Margaret has siblings who also have responsibilities to their mother\n    And Margaret currently does most hands-on care\n    When the family_elohim coordinates elder care among siblings\n    Then all siblings' contributions should be visible\n    And disparities in care burden should be evident\n    And fair distribution conversations should be supported by data\n    And Margaret should not bear disproportionate burden invisibly\n    And sibling care economy should operate on transparency\n    And family equity should be maintained across distance and circumstance\n\n  Scenario: Family food sharing and meal provision as care contribution\n    Given Margaret sometimes cooks meals for her daughter's family\n    And she hosts family dinners and holiday meals\n    When Margaret's food provision is tracked as care\n    Then meal preparation and hosting should be recognized as labor\n    And the economic value of meals provided should be calculated\n    And family food sharing should be visible care contribution\n    And Margaret's cooking and hospitality should be valued\n    And food as care should be part of family care economy\n    And invisible domestic labor should become visible\n\n  Scenario: Supporting adult children through financial constraints\n    Given Margaret has very limited resources herself\n    And her adult children sometimes face financial challenges\n    When Margaret provides non-financial support\n    Then her care contributions should be recognized as valuable\n    And the family_elohim should show how her labor saves money\n    And childcare provided prevents need for paid care\n    And her contributions have real economic impact\n    And Margaret's value to family doesn't require financial resources\n    And care economy should be visible alongside financial economy\n\n  Scenario: Planning for Margaret's own future care needs\n    Given Margaret is providing care now but will need care eventually\n    And she's watching her mother's care requirements\n    When the family_elohim facilitates future care planning\n    Then Margaret's current care contributions should build future care security\n    And family should understand reciprocal care obligations\n    And Margaret's care tokens should represent future care resources\n    And conversations about her eventual needs should be normalized\n    And family should prepare for role reversal\n    And Margaret should have agency in planning her own future care\n\n  Scenario: Protecting Margaret's time for self-care and personal life\n    Given Margaret's family depends on her care contributions\n    And she needs time for her own health and well-being\n    When the family_elohim monitors Margaret's time allocation\n    Then it should protect her time for personal needs\n    And it should flag when family demands encroach on self-care\n    And Margaret should be supported in setting boundaries\n    And family should understand that her care capacity requires self-care\n    And she should be encouraged to maintain her own friendships and interests\n    And the system should prevent family from consuming all her time\n\n  Scenario: Multigenerational family gatherings coordinated with care recognition\n    Given Margaret often hosts or coordinates family gatherings\n    And these gatherings require significant labor\n    When Margaret organizes family events\n    Then the planning, preparation, and hosting labor should be tracked\n    And other family members should see the work involved\n    And equitable distribution of hosting burden should be encouraged\n    And Margaret's contributions should be recognized and appreciated\n    And family gatherings should not depend on her invisible labor\n    And care work that makes family connection possible should be valued\n",
