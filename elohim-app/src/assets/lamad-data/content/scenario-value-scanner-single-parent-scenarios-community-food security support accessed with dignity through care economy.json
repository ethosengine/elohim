  "content": "Scenario: Food security support accessed with dignity through care economy\n    Given Maria's $175/week grocery budget for four people is severely constrained\n    And food security is essential for family well-being\n    When Maria's economic status qualifies her for food support\n    Then the community_elohim should connect her to food assistance programs\n    And support should be framed as care economy reciprocity, not charity\n    And Maria should access help without stigmatizing means-testing processes\n    And her massive care contributions should be recognized as qualifying her for support\n    And food assistance should be dignified and adequate for family needs\n",
