  "content": "Scenario: Building international coalition resisting corporate capture\n    Given corporations lobby internationally for favorable regulation\n    And they use different nations to triangulate pressure\n    When I coordinate with international policy maker allies\n    Then we share: intelligence about lobbying tactics\n    And we coordinate: resistance to capture attempts\n    And we establish: transparency requirements for global lobbying\n    And we support: each other under corporate pressure\n    And we create: race-to-top rather than race-to-bottom\n    And we demonstrate: democratic solidarity across nations\n    And we protect: protocol sovereignty through collective action\n",
