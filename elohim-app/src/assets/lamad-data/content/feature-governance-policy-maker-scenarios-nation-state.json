National-Level Policy Making for AI Governance\n  As a policy_maker in the governance system\n  Operating at the nation_state governance layer\n  I want to establish national framework for democratic AI governance\n  So that protocol can flourish while integrating with national law and institutions\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the policy_maker user is registered in the system\n    And the nation_state governance context is active\n    And Senator Elena Ruiz works on national AI governance legislation\n\n  Scenario: Drafting Community AI Infrastructure Act for national funding\n    Given poor communities nationwide need infrastructure support\n    And I want equitable protocol access\n    When I draft national funding legislation\n    Then I provide: grants for community nodes and maintenance\n    And I fund: research evaluating protocol outcomes\n    And I support: technical assistance for poor communities\n    And I establish: sliding scale and cross-subsidization\n    And I treat: democratic AI governance as public infrastructure\n    And I defend: against claims of \"picking winners\"\n    And I argue: this enables democracy not market manipulation\n\n  Scenario: Defending legislation against corporate capture testimony\n    Given corporate lobbyists testify against my legislation\n    And they claim it \"stifles innovation\"\n    When I respond in committee hearing\n    Then I present: evidence from Riverside and research\n    And I show: protocol improves community outcomes\n    And I demonstrate: constitutional oversight working\n    And I compare: to corporate AI failures (surveillance, discrimination, no recourse)\n    And I argue: we're stifling extraction, enabling flourishing\n    And I maintain: that democracy deserves support\n    And committee votes: 8-5 in favor despite lobbying\n\n  Scenario: Creating Digital Constitutional Rights Amendment\n    Given protocol creates new forms of governance and rights\n    And constitutional recognition would strengthen legitimacy\n    When I propose national constitutional amendment\n    Then I recognize: sortition governance as legitimate democratic form\n    And I establish: right to appeal agent decisions\n    And I protect: community sovereignty over protocol adoption\n    And I enshrine: privacy protections and dignity guarantees\n    And amendment goes through: lengthy deliberative process\n    And if passed: transforms national constitutional framework\n    And protocol gains: highest legal recognition\n\n  Scenario: Establishing federal-state coordination framework\n    Given protocol operates at multiple layers\n    And coordination is needed without centralization\n    When I create federal-state cooperation legislation\n    Then I establish: funding programs respecting state sovereignty\n    And I create: interstate coordination mechanisms\n    And I specify: federal role as support not control\n    And I protect: community and state autonomy\n    And I enable: national coherence with local diversity\n    And I demonstrate: federalism working for AI governance\n\n  Scenario: Integrating protocol with national court system\n    Given judicial system must work with protocol governance\n    And judges need training and procedural guidance\n    When I work with judicial branch on integration\n    Then I support: judicial education about agent reasoning\n    And I establish: evidentiary standards for agent testimony\n    And I create: appeal pathways for council-court conflicts\n    And I ensure: due process protections maintained\n    And I respect: judicial independence\n    And I enable: protocol to function within legal framework\n\n  Scenario: Addressing protocol implications for labor and employment law\n    Given protocol affects work and value recognition\n    And care work generates care tokens\n    When I update labor law for protocol economy\n    Then I clarify: status of care tokens vs traditional wages\n    And I address: worker protections in protocol-mediated work\n    And I ensure: fair labor standards apply\n    And I update: social insurance for protocol participants\n    And I protect: workers while enabling innovation\n    And law adapts: to new forms of value creation\n\n  Scenario: Creating national crisis reserve funds for protocol resilience\n    Given crises may threaten protocol infrastructure\n    And rapid response funding is needed\n    When I establish emergency reserves\n    Then I fund: rapid scaling for refugee crises\n    And I support: attack response against corporate or authoritarian threats\n    And I provide: disaster recovery for damaged infrastructure\n    And reserves ensure: protocol survives shocks\n    And resilience: is built into national support\n    And democratic governance: can weather emergencies\n\n  Scenario: Testifying to National Constitutional Council on policy needs\n    Given National Council reviewing case with policy implications\n    And they request my perspective as policy maker\n    When I testify about legislative context\n    Then I explain: existing law and its limitations\n    And I describe: policy challenges protocol helps address\n    And I clarify: how council precedent would affect legislation\n    And I don't advocate: for particular constitutional interpretation\n    And I inform: their deliberation with policy expertise\n    And I demonstrate: collaboration between sortition and representative democracy\n\n  Scenario: Commissioning independent research on protocol effectiveness\n    Given I need evidence for policy evaluation\n    And research must be independent to be credible\n    When I establish national research program\n    Then I fund: rigorous evaluation by independent researchers\n    And I require: open access publication\n    And I support: longitudinal studies tracking long-term outcomes\n    And I enable: replication and peer review\n    And I demand: honest reporting including null results\n    And evidence base: supports informed democratic choice\n    And public funding: serves public knowledge\n\n  Scenario: Responding to national security agencies' concerns\n    Given intelligence agencies claim protocol creates vulnerabilities\n    And they request backdoors or monitoring capabilities\n    When I evaluate security claims critically\n    Then I consult: cryptographers about technical impossibility\n    And I examine: whether concerns are legitimate or pretext\n    And I compare: risks of backdoors vs risks they claim to address\n    And I consider: historical abuse of security exceptions\n    And I establish: oversight mechanisms if special provisions needed\n    And I resist: security becoming excuse for unaccountable power\n    And I protect: democracy even under security claims\n\n  Scenario: Creating sunset provisions and mandatory review\n    Given laws should be evaluated not permanent\n    And I want to prevent ossification\n    When I include sunset clauses in legislation\n    Then laws expire: after 5-7 years unless renewed\n    And I force: regular review of whether laws serve purpose\n    And I create: opportunities to correct mistakes\n    And I prevent: captured legislation persisting forever\n    And democratic accountability: includes ability to reverse decisions\n\n  Scenario: Participating in national media discourse on AI governance\n    Given public understanding shapes political will\n    And my voice carries weight as committee chair\n    When I engage in public education\n    Then I explain: why democratic AI governance matters\n    And I describe: how protocol works and what's at stake\n    And I acknowledge: uncertainties and limitations\n    And I present: alternatives honestly (corporate control, heavy regulation, protocol)\n    And I make: case for democratic choice\n    And I avoid: partisan framing or ideological advocacy\n    And I serve: informed democratic deliberation\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating with international counterparts on AI governance\n    Given AI governance is global challenge\n    And national policies affect each other\n    When I work with international policy makers\n    Then we share: legislative approaches and evidence\n    And we coordinate: to resist regulatory arbitrage\n    And we establish: democratic governance norms\n    And we resist: race-to-bottom dynamics\n    And we protect: protocol sovereignty internationally\n    And we support: global democratic AI development\n",
