  "content": "Scenario: State development policy outcomes versus promises\n    Given state legislature passed developer-backed \"affordable housing\" law\n    And promised it would increase affordable housing supply\n    When the Observer tracks actual outcomes three years later\n    Then analysis shows: luxury housing increased 40%\n    And affordable housing decreased 8%\n    And displacement accelerated in gentrifying neighborhoods\n    And policy delivered opposite of promised outcomes\n    And evidence supports policy reform not developer rhetoric\n",
