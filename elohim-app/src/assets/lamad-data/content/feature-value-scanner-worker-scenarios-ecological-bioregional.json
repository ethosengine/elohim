  "content": "Feature: Ecological and Bioregional Care Work for Workers in Food Systems\n  As a worker in food preparation and service\n  I need to understand and participate in ecological care within food systems\n  So that my labor contributes to bioregional food sovereignty and environmental flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given I work in food preparation and see food systems directly\n    And I understand the care labor embedded in growing and preparing food\n    And the bioregion has food production and distribution systems\n    And the protocol recognizes ecological care as part of care economy\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing food systems care work from field to table\n    Given my restaurant work is one link in food systems care chain\n    And farmers, distributors, and preparers all contribute care labor\n    When I view food systems through care economy lens\n    Then the protocol should make visible the care work in entire food chain\n    And help me understand my connection to farmers and food producers\n    And recognize that all food work is care labor serving human nourishment\n    And build consciousness about care economy in food systems\n\n  Scenario: Witnessing food waste and understanding ecological cost\n    Given I see significant food waste in restaurant operations\n    And food waste represents wasted care labor and ecological resources\n    When I observe food system inefficiencies\n    Then the protocol should help me understand ecological and care economy costs\n    And support me in advocating for waste reduction\n    And connect me to food rescue or composting initiatives\n    And recognize that reducing waste is care work for ecology\n\n  Scenario: Understanding ingredient sourcing and bioregional food\n    Given my restaurant uses ingredients from various sources\n    And some may be local/seasonal while others are industrial/imported\n    When I want to understand food sourcing\n    Then the protocol should provide information about ingredient origins\n    And help me understand bioregional vs. industrial food systems\n    And recognize that bioregional food supports local ecology and economy\n    And build consciousness about care economy implications of sourcing\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for sustainable food practices at work\n    Given my workplace makes decisions about sourcing and operations\n    When I want to advocate for more sustainable and care-aligned practices\n    Then the protocol should help me propose sustainable improvements\n    Such as local sourcing, waste reduction, composting, sustainable packaging\n    And provide evidence for ecological and economic benefits\n    And support me in advocating for care-economy-aligned food operations\n\n  Scenario: Connecting with local food producers and farmers\n    Given local farmers are doing care work to grow food\n    And I am doing care work to prepare food\n    When I want to connect with bioregional food producers\n    Then the protocol should facilitate connections between workers and farmers\n    And support relationships that strengthen local food systems\n    And help me understand farming as care labor deserving dignity and fair compensation\n    And build solidarity between farm workers and food service workers\n\n  Scenario: Participating in food sovereignty initiatives\n    Given corporate food systems extract from workers and communities\n    And alternative food systems can support local care economy\n    When I want to participate in food sovereignty organizing\n    Then the protocol should connect me to food justice initiatives\n    And support participation in food co-ops, community agriculture, or food policy\n    And recognize my expertise as food worker in food systems transformation\n    And build bioregional food systems aligned with care economy\n\n  Scenario: Understanding ecological impact of food systems work\n    Given food systems have significant ecological footprint\n    And my work is embedded in these systems\n    When I want to understand ecological implications\n    Then the protocol should provide information about food systems ecology\n    And help me see connections between my work and environmental impact\n    And support me in making choices that reduce ecological harm\n    And recognize that ecological care is part of my care economy participation\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for worker and environmental justice together\n    Given worker exploitation and environmental exploitation are connected\n    When I organize for worker dignity and fair compensation\n    Then the protocol should help me connect labor justice to ecological justice\n    And recognize that care economy serves both human and ecological flourishing\n    And support advocacy that addresses both worker conditions and environmental sustainability\n    And build movements connecting labor rights and environmental protection\n\n  Scenario: Learning about regenerative food systems\n    Given current industrial food systems are extractive\n    And regenerative agriculture can restore ecological health\n    When I want to understand alternatives to industrial food\n    Then the protocol should provide education about regenerative food systems\n    And connect me to regenerative food initiatives in bioregion\n    And help me envision food work that contributes to ecological restoration\n    And support transformation toward care-economy-aligned food systems\n\n  Scenario: Participating in composting and food waste reduction\n    Given restaurants generate significant compostable waste\n    And composting returns nutrients to soil and supports local ecology\n    When I want to participate in composting initiatives\n    Then the protocol should connect me to composting programs\n    And recognize participation in waste reduction as care work\n    And support workplace implementation of composting\n    And contribute to bioregional nutrient cycling and soil health\n\n  Scenario: Supporting bioregional food security and resilience\n    Given bioregions need resilient local food systems\n    And my food preparation skills contribute to food security\n    When I want to support bioregional food resilience\n    Then the protocol should connect me to community food security initiatives\n    And help me contribute skills to mutual aid food programs\n    And recognize that local food systems support community and ecological resilience\n    And build bioregional capacity for food sovereignty\n\n  Scenario: Making visible that food work is care for people and planet\n    Given all food work serves human nourishment and ecological cycles\n    And food workers are caring for people and participating in bioregional systems\n    When the broader culture treats food work as low-value service\n    Then the protocol should make visible that food work is essential care labor\n    And reframe food service as care work for human and ecological flourishing\n    And advocate that food workers deserve dignity, fair compensation, and care-aligned conditions\n    And build consciousness that care economy includes ecological care and all food work serves life\n",
