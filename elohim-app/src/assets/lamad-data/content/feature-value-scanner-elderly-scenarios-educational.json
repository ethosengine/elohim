Educational Layer Lifelong Learning and Wisdom Sharing for Elderly\n  As an elderly person in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want to continue learning and sharing knowledge throughout my life\n  So that I experience ongoing growth and contribute accumulated wisdom\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the elderly user \"Helen\" is registered in the system\n    And Helen has 82 years of lived experience\n    And Helen manages early-stage dementia but retains substantial knowledge\n    And the educational governance context is active\n    And learning and contribution continue throughout life\n\n  Scenario: Senior learning programs adapted for cognitive accessibility\n    Given Helen participates in senior learning programs\n    And her cognitive and physical capabilities require accommodation\n    When Helen engages with educational content\n    Then programs should be paced for senior learners\n    And materials should use large fonts and high contrast\n    And voice content should be available alongside visual\n    And no time pressure should be imposed\n    And learning should be meaningful, not make-work\n    And the protocol should ensure education remains accessible at all ages\n    And Helen should experience genuine learning, not patronizing activities\n\n  Scenario: Accumulated wisdom recognized as valuable knowledge\n    Given Helen has 82 years of lived experience\n    And this accumulated wisdom has educational value\n    When Helen shares her knowledge with others\n    Then her contributions should be recognized as teaching\n    And care tokens should reflect her educational labor\n    And wisdom sharing should be valued alongside formal education\n    And the protocol should make visible that elders are teachers\n    And Helen should experience herself as knowledge contributor\n    And educational systems should recognize experiential learning\n    And lifetime of experience should be treated as legitimate expertise\n\n  Scenario: Intergenerational knowledge transfer through elder mentoring\n    Given younger generations lack knowledge Helen possesses\n    And intergenerational learning benefits all participants\n    When Helen mentors grandchildren or community youth\n    Then her teaching should be facilitated by educational systems\n    And younger learners should be connected to elder mentors\n    And Helen should be recognized as educator, not just \"nice grandma\"\n    And care tokens should reflect her teaching work\n    And the protocol should coordinate intergenerational learning\n    And educational value should flow in both directions\n    And youth should learn to value elder wisdom\n\n  Scenario: Memory preservation as educational contribution\n    Given Helen holds family and community history\n    And dementia threatens loss of collective memory\n    When Helen participates in memory preservation projects\n    Then her storytelling should be captured for educational archives\n    And oral history should be treated as legitimate historical knowledge\n    And her participation should be recognized as educational contribution\n    And the protocol should prioritize preservation while Helen can still share\n    And cultural heritage should be maintained through elder participation\n    And Helen's memory keeping should be valued as community education\n    And historical knowledge should be preserved before it's lost\n\n  Scenario: Technology literacy education adapted for elderly learners\n    Given Helen needs technology skills for daily functioning\n    And technology education often ignores elderly learners\n    When Helen learns to use new technologies\n    Then instruction should be adapted to her learning pace\n    And age-appropriate pedagogy should be employed\n    And no assumption of prior tech knowledge should be made\n    And patient repetition should be available\n    And learning should serve her actual needs, not abstract skills\n    And the protocol should ensure elderly inclusion in digital literacy\n    And Helen should be empowered, not left behind by technology\n\n  Scenario: Teaching traditional skills and practices to younger generations\n    Given Helen knows traditional household management, cooking, and crafts\n    And younger generations often lack these practical skills\n    When Helen teaches traditional knowledge\n    Then her expertise should be recognized and valued\n    And teaching opportunities should be coordinated\n    And her knowledge should be preserved through transmission\n    And care tokens should reflect her educational contributions\n    And the protocol should facilitate skills transfer from elders\n    And traditional knowledge should be valued in educational systems\n    And Helen should experience being needed for what she knows\n\n  Scenario: Learning that personhood and growth continue until death\n    Given culture often treats elderly as finished developing\n    And Helen continues to learn and grow at 82\n    When Helen engages with educational opportunities\n    Then the protocol should affirm that learning never ends\n    And growth should be supported at all ages\n    And Helen should experience ongoing development\n    And new capabilities should be acknowledged and celebrated\n    And education should reject notion that personhood ends with productivity decline\n    And the protocol should model that humans grow throughout life\n    And Helen should learn that she remains person until death\n\n  Scenario: Cognitive support enables continued learning despite limitations\n    Given Helen's dementia affects learning and memory\n    And cognitive support can enable continued engagement\n    When Helen participates in educational activities\n    Then her personal_agent should provide cognitive scaffolding\n    And material should be adapted to her cognitive capabilities\n    And she should experience success, not frustration\n    And limitations should be accommodated, not treated as disqualification\n    And the protocol should enable learning despite cognitive changes\n    And Helen should remain engaged with intellectual life\n    And dementia should not end her identity as learner\n\n  Scenario: Value literacy education through lived experience at advanced age\n    Given Helen uses Value Scanner with assistance\n    And she's learning care economy principles through practice\n    When Helen makes care-based decisions\n    Then she should be learning that her contributions still matter\n    And value literacy should be accessible at all ages\n    And care economy principles should be demonstrated through her experience\n    And she should understand that care has value regardless of age\n    And the protocol should teach through experience, not explanation\n    And Helen should internalize that she has worth beyond productivity\n    And care economy education should include all ages\n\n  Scenario: Teaching about aging and mortality to younger generations\n    Given Helen faces mortality consciously\n    And younger generations need education about aging and death\n    When Helen shares her experience of aging\n    Then this should be recognized as valuable teaching\n    And younger people should learn from her direct experience\n    And education about mortality should come from those facing it\n    And Helen should be recognized as expert on her own aging\n    And the protocol should facilitate difficult but necessary conversations\n    And death education should be normalized through elder participation\n    And Helen's voice should teach community about aging with dignity\n\n  Scenario: Ecological wisdom from lifetime of experience\n    Given Helen has observed environmental changes over 82 years\n    And her generation has knowledge of pre-industrial practices\n    When Helen shares ecological knowledge\n    Then her observations should inform environmental education\n    And traditional sustainable practices should be preserved\n    And her lifetime of data should be valued in climate education\n    And care tokens should reflect her contribution to ecological stewardship\n    And the protocol should recognize elders as environmental historians\n    And ecological education should include elder perspectives\n    And Helen's knowledge should contribute to community sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Continued intellectual engagement prevents cognitive decline\n    Given cognitive engagement supports brain health in aging\n    And intellectual isolation accelerates decline\n    When Helen participates in learning and teaching\n    Then educational engagement should be recognized as health intervention\n    And community should support elder intellectual life\n    And learning opportunities should be accessible and meaningful\n    And the protocol should demonstrate that education serves health in aging\n    And Helen should remain intellectually engaged\n    And cognitive health should be supported through educational participation\n    And investment in elder learning should be justified by health outcomes\n",
