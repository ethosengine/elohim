  "content": "Scenario: Reconciling conflicting regional constitutional interpretations\n    Given different regions interpreted same principle differently\n    And inconsistency creates confusion and injustice\n    When we provide definitive national interpretation\n    Then we honor: legitimate regional diversity where appropriate\n    And we establish: national minimums all regions must respect\n    And we explain: which variation is constitutional and which violates\n    And we create: coherence without imposing uniformity\n    And we guide: regional councils with clear framework\n    And we enable: coordinated governance across diverse communities\n    And we demonstrate: how subsidiarity and consistency coexist\n",
