  "content": "Scenario: Manager receives liberation from moral injury of implementing exploitation\n    Given Marcus previously enforced corporate extraction policies\n    And he experienced stress from implementing exploitation he knew was harmful\n    When ChickenMax converts to EAE democratic ownership\n    Then Marcus is offered choice to transition or exit with dignified severance\n    And if he chooses to stay, his role shifts from enforcing extraction to facilitating coordination\n    And he no longer implements policies harming workers he knows\n    And his stress levels decrease measurably (lower cortisol, better sleep)\n    And workplace_elohim documents his transition from extraction to service\n",
