  "content": "Scenario: Fair distribution of household labor among roommates\n    Given Kenji does most cooking but little cleaning\n    And roommates have different strengths and available time\n    When the household_elohim tracks all household labor\n    Then it should measure cooking, cleaning, shopping, maintenance, and organizing\n    And it should show each roommate's contribution: \"Kenji: 18hrs, Maya: 6hrs, Sam: 8hrs, Jordan: 4hrs\"\n    And it should surface imbalances explicitly\n    And it should facilitate conversation about fair redistribution\n    And the system should prevent exploitation through visibility\n    And household equity should be measurable and adjustable\n",
