  "content": "Scenario: Part-time employment with full benefits for caregivers\n    Given James can only work part-time due to caregiving\n    And loss of benefits creates devastating vulnerability\n    When the workplace_elohim advocates for benefits policy\n    Then part-time caregiver employees should access benefits\n    And healthcare coverage should not require full-time employment\n    And benefits should recognize caregiving as legitimate constraint\n    And workplace should not force caregivers to choose between care and benefits\n    And employment protection should include part-time caregivers\n",
