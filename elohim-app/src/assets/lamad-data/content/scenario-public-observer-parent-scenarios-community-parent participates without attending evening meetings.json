  "content": "Scenario: Parent participates without attending evening meetings\n    Given the parent has evening work shifts and bedtime routines\n    And cannot attend 7 PM community meetings in person\n    When decisions about afterschool programs are being made\n    Then the parent reviews 5-minute summaries during lunch break\n    And submits questions and positions via mobile app\n    And receives alerts if live intervention would be high-impact\n    And gets post-meeting summary with next action steps\n    And democracy respects that raising children is the priority job\n",
