  "content": "Scenario: Politician exposes corporate wage theft patterns requiring enforcement\n    Given worker advocates report systematic wage theft\n    And enforcement resources are limited\n    When the Observer analyzes wage and hour violations\n    Then they see violation patterns by industry and employer\n    And identify employers with repeated wage theft violations\n    And understand which worker populations most affected\n    And calculate economic impact of wage theft on working families\n    And demand enforcement resources targeting systematic violators\n",
