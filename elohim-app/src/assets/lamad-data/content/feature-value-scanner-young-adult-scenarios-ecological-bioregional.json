Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Young Adult\n  As a young adult making independent consumption decisions\n  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer\n  I want to understand environmental impacts and make sustainable choices\n  So that I balance ecological responsibility with budget constraints\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the young_adult user \"Aisha\" is registered in the system\n    And Aisha is an independent consumer\n    And her choices directly affect ecological systems\n    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active\n    And the bioregional_elohim coordinates environmental stewardship\n    And Aisha wants to be environmentally responsible within her means\n\n  Scenario: Understanding ecological impact of consumption choices\n    Given Aisha's food choices affect environmental systems\n    And she wants to minimize negative impacts\n    When Aisha selects items in the Value Scanner\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should show environmental impact\n    And it should explain ecological consequences of different options\n    And it should make invisible environmental costs visible\n    And she should understand how consumption affects ecosystems\n    And ecological literacy should inform decision-making\n    And environmental impact should be transparent\n\n  Scenario: Balancing environmental responsibility with budget constraints\n    Given Aisha has limited financial resources\n    And sustainable options often cost more\n    When Aisha makes purchasing decisions\n    Then the personal_agent should help navigate trade-offs\n    And it should identify affordable sustainable choices\n    And it should explain when spending more reduces environmental impact\n    And it should validate doing her best within constraints\n    And the system should never shame financial limitations\n    And environmental responsibility should be accessible at all income levels\n\n  Scenario: Learning about local and seasonal food choices\n    Given local and seasonal food has lower environmental impact\n    And Aisha is learning about bioregional food systems\n    When Aisha shops for produce\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should highlight local options\n    And it should explain seasonal availability\n    And it should teach about her bioregion's food production\n    And local food choices should be encouraged when affordable\n    And she should learn her region's agricultural patterns\n    And bioregional food literacy should develop\n\n  Scenario: Reducing food waste to minimize environmental impact\n    Given food waste has significant ecological costs\n    And Aisha sometimes buys more than she can use\n    When the personal_agent tracks waste patterns\n    Then it should identify environmental impact of waste\n    And it should suggest waste reduction strategies\n    And it should help her buy appropriate quantities\n    And waste reduction should be framed as environmental care\n    And the system should help her minimize ecological harm\n    And practical waste reduction should be taught\n\n  Scenario: Understanding transportation impact on food choices\n    Given transportation contributes to food's environmental footprint\n    And Aisha lives in an urban area\n    When the bioregional_elohim analyzes her shopping patterns\n    Then it should consider transportation in environmental impact\n    And it should suggest efficient shopping routes\n    And it should help her minimize transportation emissions\n    And the full ecological cost including transport should be visible\n    And bioregional analysis should inform sustainable choices\n\n  Scenario: Participating in bioregional food systems\n    Given bioregional food systems reduce environmental impact\n    And Aisha could access local food networks\n    When the bioregional_elohim surfaces opportunities\n    Then it should connect her to farmers markets, CSAs, or food hubs\n    And it should explain benefits of bioregional food systems\n    And it should help her participate within budget constraints\n    And local food networks should be accessible and affordable\n    And bioregional participation should support environmental sustainability\n\n  Scenario: Learning about ecological carrying capacity and limits\n    Given ecosystems have finite carrying capacity\n    And consumption must stay within ecological limits\n    When the personal_agent teaches environmental concepts\n    Then it should explain ecological limits and boundaries\n    And it should help her understand planetary boundaries\n    And it should frame consumption within ecological context\n    And she should learn that infinite growth is impossible\n    And ecological literacy should include limits and constraints\n\n  Scenario: Sustainable protein choices within budget\n    Given protein production has varied environmental impact\n    And Aisha wants to make sustainable choices\n    When Aisha selects protein sources\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should show environmental impact differences\n    And it should highlight lower-impact protein options\n    And it should help her access affordable sustainable proteins\n    And plant-based options should be presented when cheaper\n    And environmental impact should inform protein decisions\n    And sustainable nutrition should be achievable on her budget\n\n  Scenario: Understanding water usage in food production\n    Given food production uses significant water resources\n    And water scarcity is increasing\n    When the bioregional_elohim displays environmental data\n    Then it should include water usage in impact assessment\n    And it should explain water costs of different foods\n    And it should help her choose lower water-impact options\n    And bioregional water context should inform recommendations\n    And she should understand food-water connections\n\n  Scenario: Packaging waste reduction and recycling\n    Given packaging creates environmental waste\n    And Aisha wants to reduce packaging impact\n    When Aisha makes purchasing decisions\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should highlight packaging differences\n    And it should suggest lower-packaging alternatives\n    And it should provide local recycling and composting information\n    And waste management should connect to bioregional systems\n    And she should learn to minimize packaging waste\n    And circular economy principles should be taught\n\n  Scenario: Climate impact of dietary choices\n    Given food production contributes to climate change\n    And individual choices aggregate to systemic impact\n    When Aisha evaluates food options\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should show carbon footprint\n    And it should explain climate impact of different choices\n    And it should help her make lower-impact selections\n    And climate literacy should inform dietary decisions\n    And she should understand individual contribution to climate crisis\n    And climate-conscious choices should be supported\n\n  Scenario: Connecting to bioregional ecological restoration efforts\n    Given her bioregion needs ecological restoration\n    And young adults can contribute to environmental healing\n    When Aisha explores environmental participation\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should surface restoration opportunities\n    And it should connect her to local environmental projects\n    And her ecological care work should be recognized\n    And environmental stewardship should extend beyond consumption\n    And she should participate in active ecological healing\n    And care tokens should value environmental restoration work\n\n  Scenario: Learning about industrial agriculture impacts\n    Given industrial agriculture has severe environmental costs\n    And Aisha consumes products of agricultural systems\n    When the personal_agent teaches about food systems\n    Then it should explain industrial agriculture's impacts\n    And it should highlight alternatives like regenerative agriculture\n    And it should help her support better food systems\n    And agricultural literacy should inform purchasing\n    And she should understand systemic environmental issues\n    And food system education should enable values-aligned choices\n\n  Scenario: Balancing nutritional needs with environmental impact\n    Given Aisha needs adequate nutrition\n    And environmental sustainability is also important\n    When she makes food decisions\n    Then the personal_agent should help balance priorities\n    And it should optimize for both nutrition and environmental impact\n    And it should never compromise her health for environmental goals\n    And human flourishing and ecological health should both matter\n    And the system should find win-win solutions when possible\n    And trade-offs should be explained transparently\n\n  Scenario: Building lifelong environmental stewardship practices\n    Given Aisha's consumption patterns will span decades\n    And early adult habits shape lifelong practices\n    When Aisha develops consumption patterns\n    Then the bioregional_elohim should support sustainable habits\n    And it should help her establish environmentally responsible practices\n    And patterns developed now should serve her throughout life\n    And environmental stewardship should become second nature\n    And her generation should normalize ecological responsibility\n    And sustainable consumption should be her baseline expectation\n",
