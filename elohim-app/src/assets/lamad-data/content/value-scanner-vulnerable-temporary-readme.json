Three months ago she was a partnered parent in a seemingly stable household; now she's navigating domestic violence shelter systems, legal proceedings, employment search, childcare crisis, housing uncertainty, trauma recovery, and the overwhelming task of rebuilding life from pieces. She uses the Value Scanner to manage an extremely constrained budget (temporary assistance, child support that doesn't arrive reliably, no employment yet), coordinate children's needs amid chaos, access community resources without drowning in stigma, and maintain some nutrition and stability for her family. Her care token accumulation reflects her substantial parenting labor and her beginning participation in shelter community mutual aid\u2014she's contributing even while in crisis.\n\nTanya represents people experiencing temporary vulnerability\u2014those navigating life crises, transitions, or circumstances that create acute need for support. This category includes people escaping domestic violence, newly homeless, recovering from medical crisis, navigating job loss, experiencing mental health crisis, in addiction recovery, recently incarcerated and reentering community, refugees/newly arrived immigrants, or facing other situations of acute vulnerability. What makes this category distinct is temporariness\u2014these aren't permanent conditions (like aging or developmental disability) but rather crises or transitions that could resolve with appropriate support.\n\nThe Value Scanner serves Tanya by making her care contributions visible even in crisis (she's still parenting, still caring for her children, still contributing to community), connecting her to support networks that recognize her humanity and agency, coordinating the overwhelming complexity of crisis navigation, and treating her as a person experiencing difficult circumstances\u2014not as a problem, a failure, or a charity case. The protocol embodies care economy principle that everyone deserves support during vulnerability, and that temporary crisis doesn't erase personhood, capability, or worth.\n\n## Core Needs\n\n- **Immediate Crisis Support with Dignity**: Tanya needs rapid access to resources that enable basic survival\u2014food assistance, housing support, childcare coordination, legal help, medical care, trauma services\u2014but provided with dignity, not degradation. Traditional social services often require proving you're needy enough (means testing), exposing private trauma, navigating Kafkaesque bureaucracy, accepting stigma and surveillance, and losing agency. The Value Scanner should coordinate crisis support differently: based on care economy participation (Tanya's parenting is care work that creates standing for support), with respect for her privacy and autonomy, through community networks rather than institutional gatekeeping, framed as reciprocal care rather than charity. She's not a failure\u2014she's a person in crisis who deserves support.\n\n- **Coordinating Overwhelming Complexity**: Tanya is navigating impossible complexity\u2014legal system (protective orders, custody, divorce), social services (TANF, SNAP, housing assistance), employment search (with gaps in resume and childcare constraints), children's needs (trauma responses, school stability, emotional support), her own trauma recovery, and daily survival logistics. Her personal_agent needs to function as genuine cognitive partner\u2014tracking appointments and deadlines, coordinating across systems, surfacing important information, providing decision support, and preventing things from falling through cracks. Without sophisticated coordination support, crisis complexity can become overwhelming and retraumatizing.\n\n- **Maintaining Parenting Capability Amid Crisis**: Tanya needs tools that help her continue providing good care to her children despite overwhelming circumstances. The Value Scanner helps her manage children's nutrition on catastrophically tight budget, coordinate their school and childcare, track their trauma responses and needs, maintain some stability and routine, and preserve her capacity to be emotionally present. Her parenting labor is made visible through care token accumulation\u2014she's not \"just surviving,\" she's providing sophisticated care work under extreme constraint. Recognition matters\u2014both for her self-understanding and for potential future opportunities (employment, housing, community standing).\n\n- **Building Toward Stability and Independence**: Tanya needs support that enables movement toward stability, not permanent dependency. The protocol should help her build toward independent household: employment search and skill development, stable housing pathway, community connections that will endure beyond crisis, accumulating care economy standing that will serve her future, and trauma recovery that restores her capability for thriving. Support should be scaffolding that gradually releases as she rebuilds capability, not control that perpetuates dependence.\n\n- **Connection to Peer Support and Solidarity**: Tanya needs connection to other people who've experienced similar crises\u2014domestic violence survivors, people navigating housing instability, single parents rebuilding lives, others who understand without judgment. The Value Scanner should facilitate peer support networks where Tanya can find understanding, practical advice, mutual aid, and solidarity. These connections reduce isolation, provide emotional support, share survival strategies, and build community among people society often stigmatizes and isolates.\n\n## Key Relationships\n\n**To Children**: Tanya's relationship with her children is her primary focus and motivation\u2014she's navigating crisis primarily to build safe, stable life for them. The Value Scanner helps her maintain good parenting despite overwhelming circumstances\u2014managing their nutrition, coordinating their care and schooling, tracking their trauma responses, and providing emotional support. The protocol makes visible that she's performing sophisticated parenting labor under extreme duress\u2014this is care work deserving recognition and support.\n\n**To Shelter/Transitional Housing Staff**: Tanya interfaces with shelter systems that often fail to balance support with dignity. Staff might provide essential resources while also imposing rules, surveillance, and stigma. The protocol can't change institutional dynamics, but could help Tanya navigate them\u2014understanding her rights, advocating for her needs, documenting problems, and maintaining her agency within constrained circumstances.\n\n**To Legal System**: Tanya navigates family court (custody, protective orders, divorce), possibly criminal justice (if her abuser is prosecuted), and complex legal bureaucracy. These systems are often retraumatizing for domestic violence survivors. Her personal_agent could help her track legal requirements, prepare for hearings, understand her rights, and coordinate with legal aid services. The protocol makes visible that navigating legal systems is labor\u2014sophisticated, stressful work that Tanya is managing while caring for children and surviving crisis.\n\n**To Social Services**: Tanya depends on benefits and services (TANF, SNAP, housing assistance, childcare subsidies), each with separate application processes, documentation requirements, eligibility rules, and bureaucratic demands. Her personal_agent helps her navigate this overwhelming complexity\u2014tracking deadlines, managing documentation, coordinating across programs, and preventing loss of benefits due to administrative burden.\n\n**To Potential Employers**: Tanya is seeking employment but faces challenges\u2014resume gaps, childcare constraints, trauma affecting her capacity, employer discrimination against domestic violence survivors or housing-unstable people. The workplace_elohim could help her present her capabilities effectively, understand her rights, negotiate for flexibility, and recognize when employment opportunities are genuine versus exploitative.\n\n**To Community Support Networks**: Tanya needs community care economy\u2014mutual aid networks, peer support, resource sharing, practical assistance, and social connection. The Value Scanner connects her to these networks based on care economy principles: her parenting labor creates standing for support, assistance flows reciprocally (she contributes as she's able, receives when she needs), and community treats her as member deserving support, not charity case.\n\n**To Family**: Tanya's family relationships might be complicated\u2014some family members supportive, others aligned with abuser, still others unavailable or toxic. The family_elohim could help her coordinate support from safe family connections while maintaining boundaries with harmful family dynamics.\n\n**To Personal Agent**: Tanya's personal_agent is absolutely essential\u2014it's cognitive support for navigating crisis complexity while traumatized and resource-depleted. The agent helps her track everything, coordinate across contexts, surface important information, provide decision support, and prevent her from being overwhelmed. It watches for signs of increasing crisis and proactively connects her to support.\n\n## Relevant Governance Layers\n\n### Geographic/Political\n\n**Individual Layer**\nTanya maintains individual autonomy even amid crisis and institutional involvement\u2014she's making decisions about her life and her children's lives, rebuilding according to her values, and exercising agency despite constraint. The protocol protects her sovereignty.\n\n**Household Layer**\nTanya is rebuilding household governance as single parent\u2014making all decisions, managing resources alone, coordinating children's lives, creating new household norms and stability after trauma.\n\n**Family Layer**\nTanya participates in family governance across her immediate household (children), potentially supportive extended family, and legal negotiations with her abuser around custody and support. The family_elohim helps coordinate these complex, often fraught relationships.\n\n**Neighborhood Layer**\nTanya is building neighborhood connections in her temporary housing location\u2014learning local resources, meeting neighbors, participating in community life as she's able. These connections might continue if she stays in the area or provide model for building community in her next location.\n\n**Community Layer**\nTanya engages community care economy primarily as someone needing support right now, but her parenting labor and beginning mutual aid participation are community contributions. The community_elohim coordinates support while recognizing her continuing contributions.\n\n### Functional\n\n**Educational Layer**\nTanya coordinates her children's educational needs amid housing instability and trauma\u2014the protocol could help her navigate school systems, access educational support services, and maintain children's educational continuity despite chaos.\n\n**Workplace/Organizational Layer**\nTanya is seeking employment\u2014the protocol should support her employment search while helping her recognize and avoid exploitative opportunities that would harm her recovery and stability building.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- **Technical**: Interface must work for someone under extreme stress, possibly traumatized, certainly overwhelmed. Absolute minimum cognitive load. Critical tasks surfaced automatically. Crisis support immediately accessible. Complexity coordination that genuinely reduces rather than increases burden. Personal_agent needs sophisticated AI to provide real cognitive partnership amid chaos. Integration with social services, legal systems, shelter resources, employment services, childcare coordination, peer support networks. Mobile-first (Tanya's circumstances are unstable, her phone might be her only reliable technology). Offline capability (she might lose internet access during crisis transitions).\n\n- **Privacy**: CRITICAL\u2014Tanya's safety might depend on privacy. Information about her location, children, legal situation, abuse history must be protected absolutely. She controls what data exists and who can access it. Default should be maximum privacy. Integration with services should never expose her to abuser or create digital trails that could endanger her. The protocol must never become surveillance or control tool used against her by institutions, family, or abuser.\n\n- **Interface**: Design for traumatized, stressed, exhausted person navigating crisis. Calming aesthetic (not adding to stress), clear information (reducing confusion), simple interactions (minimizing cognitive demand), lots of reassurance and support (countering stigma and self-blame), celebration of small victories (maintaining motivation). Recognition of care contributions should feel genuine\u2014she's doing extraordinary work under impossible circumstances. Interface should communicate: \"You are capable, you are strong, you deserve support, you will get through this.\"\n\n- **Constraints**: Crisis monitoring absolutely essential\u2014if Tanya's safety is at risk (domestic violence escalation, housing crisis, severe resource depletion, trauma crisis, children's safety compromised), protocol must surface emergency support immediately. The system should watch for danger signs and proactively connect to crisis resources. But intervention must preserve Tanya's autonomy\u2014she's the expert on her own safety, and forced interventions often make domestic violence situations more dangerous.\n\n- **Opportunities**: Millions of people experience temporary vulnerability\u2014domestic violence survivors, newly homeless, medical crisis, job loss, mental health crisis, addiction recovery, reentry from incarceration, refugee/immigration transitions. Most navigate these crises through inadequate, degrading, fragmented support systems that treat them as problems rather than people. If the Value Scanner serves people in temporary crisis with dignity\u2014making their continued contributions visible, coordinating support efficiently, connecting to peer networks, preserving autonomy, and building toward stability\u2014it demonstrates care economy can handle society's most acute challenges. Tanya's parenting labor visible during crisis proves that care contributions continue even amid vulnerability\u2014that human worth isn't conditional on stability or capability. Support that enables people to move through crisis toward stability (rather than managing them in permanent dependency) demonstrates care economy's commitment to human flourishing, not just institutional control. This population's recovery and rebuilding could prove that community care economy enables resilience that institutional charity cannot\u2014that dignity, agency, and reciprocal care create pathways out of crisis that means-tested charity and surveillance never can. Success with temporarily vulnerable populations would demonstrate the protocol's deepest values: every person deserves support when they need it, vulnerability is temporary and universal (we all experience it at some point), and care economy exists to ensure everyone can flourish, especially during their hardest times.\n",
