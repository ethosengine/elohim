  "content": "Scenario: Food waste reduction as ecological care work\n    Given Kenji cannot afford to waste food\n    And food waste has significant ecological cost\n    When the bioregional_elohim tracks food waste reduction\n    Then it should recognize Kenji's waste prevention as ecological care\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for using all ingredients\n    And it should value creative cooking with leftovers\n    And it should show \"Zero food waste this week = ecological contribution\"\n    And waste reduction should be recognized as care economy work\n    And Kenji's efficient resource use should be valued ecologically\n",
