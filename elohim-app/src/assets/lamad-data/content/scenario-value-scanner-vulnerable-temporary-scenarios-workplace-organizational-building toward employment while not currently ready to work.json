  "content": "Scenario: Building toward employment while not currently ready to work\n    Given I am still in acute crisis or early trauma recovery\n    And employment right now would overwhelm my capacity\n    When I plan for future employment while not currently seeking work\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me identify skill-building opportunities\n    And surfaces training, education, or credential programs I could pursue\n    And validates that not being employment-ready yet is appropriate\n    And helps me build toward future employment at my pace\n    And tracks my skill development and preparation\n    And my personal_agent identifies low-pressure ways to build employment readiness\n    And recognizes that recovery before employment is often necessary\n    And supports my timeline for employment readiness\n",
