  "content": "Scenario: Grappling with universal dignity across cultural differences\n    Given appeal involves tension between cultural practice and constitutional principle\n    And I must judge what's universal versus culturally specific\n    When we deliberate on cultural relativism versus human dignity\n    Then we engage: deeply with different cultural perspectives\n    And we distinguish: genuine diversity from rights violations\n    And we examine: if constitutional framework has cultural bias\n    And we consider: if subsidiarity allows variation in this domain\n    And we establish: precedent protecting pluralism within dignity bounds\n    And we avoid: both cultural imperialism and harmful relativism\n    And we demonstrate: wisdom citizens bring to profound questions\n",
