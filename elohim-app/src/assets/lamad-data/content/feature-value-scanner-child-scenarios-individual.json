Individual Layer Value Recognition for Child\n  As a child (ages 8-10) in guided autonomy\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want to make real choices with real consequences\n  So that I develop agency and learn that I am a capable steward of resources\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the child user \"Emma\" is registered in the system\n    And Emma is 8 years old\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Emma's personal_agent is configured for guided learning through inquiry\n    And Emma has demonstrated capacity for age-appropriate autonomy\n    And parental oversight is enabled with expanded boundaries\n\n  Scenario: Child makes genuine autonomous decision with real consequences\n    Given Emma is selecting cereal in the store aisle\n    And she is using the Value Scanner independently\n    And her family will actually eat the cereal she chooses\n    When Emma compares store brand and name brand cereals\n    Then her personal_agent should present factual information\n    And the agent should say \"The store brand has the same protein as the name brand, and it's $2 less\"\n    And Emma should make the final choice herself\n    And her choice should be what the family purchases\n    And the consequences should be real but age-appropriate\n    And Emma should experience the weight of genuine decision-making\n\n  Scenario: Learning value beyond price through multi-dimensional comparison\n    Given Emma is evaluating fair-trade chocolate\n    And she has capacity for understanding multiple value dimensions\n    When Emma scans the chocolate product\n    Then her personal_agent should show nutritional value\n    And the agent should show environmental impact\n    And the agent should explain care labor: \"The farmers who grew this were paid fairly for their care work\"\n    And the agent should show community benefit\n    And price should be one factor among many\n    And Emma should learn to read the world's complexity, not just price tags\n    And value literacy should extend beyond simple cost comparison\n\n  Scenario: Recognition as capable contributor not just cute helper\n    Given Emma has made a budget-conscious choice\n    And she selected store brand cereal to save money\n    When the transaction is complete\n    Then the recognition should be specific and substantive\n    And her personal_agent should say \"Your choice saved $2, which helped the family stay within budget\"\n    And the feedback should acknowledge real impact\n    And Emma should not receive patronizing praise\n    And her contribution should be valued as genuine stewardship\n    And she should build identity as capable resource manager\n    And recognition should reflect that her work actually matters\n\n  Scenario: Guided learning through Socratic questioning not instruction\n    Given Emma is comparing two products\n    And her personal_agent uses inquiry-based teaching\n    When Emma asks for help deciding\n    Then the agent should ask \"What do you notice about these two options?\"\n    And the agent should not say \"Choose this one\"\n    And the agent should prompt critical thinking\n    And the agent should ask follow-up questions based on Emma's observations\n    And Emma should develop her own reasoning capacity\n    And she should learn to think, not just follow rules\n    And the pedagogical approach should respect her as a thinker\n\n  Scenario: Safe practice environment with age-appropriate mistakes\n    Given Emma makes a choice that doesn't align with family needs\n    And she selected a more expensive option without considering budget\n    When the family experiences the consequence\n    Then her personal_agent should guide gentle reflection\n    And the agent should ask \"How did that work out?\"\n    And Emma should learn from the mistake without shame\n    And consequences should be educational, not punitive\n    And she should build judgment through safe practice\n    And mistakes should be treated as learning opportunities\n    And the stakes should be appropriately low for her age\n\n  Scenario: Individual autonomy expanding based on demonstrated capability\n    Given Emma has shown good stewardship decisions over time\n    And parents can adjust autonomy levels in the system\n    When Emma's decision-making patterns are reviewed\n    Then her boundaries should expand to reflect capability\n    And she should earn more freedom through demonstrated judgment\n    And the system should track maturity indicators\n    And Emma should understand that autonomy grows with responsibility\n    And her increasing capability should be recognized\n    And freedom should be matched to demonstrated stewardship\n\n  Scenario: Personal values forming through conscious choice-making\n    Given Emma is making repeated value-based decisions\n    And she is old enough to articulate reasons for choices\n    When Emma reflects on why she makes certain choices\n    Then her personal_agent should help her identify her values\n    And the agent should ask \"What matters to you about this choice?\"\n    And Emma should begin to consciously understand her value framework\n    And her values should be forming through reflection, not imposition\n    And she should develop moral reasoning capacity\n    And individual value formation should be supported\n\n  Scenario: Privacy protection with emerging concept of data awareness\n    Given Emma's choices and decision patterns are being tracked\n    And she is beginning to understand privacy concepts\n    When Emma's data is collected\n    Then all data must stay encrypted on family devices\n    And no commercial exploitation should occur\n    And Emma should receive age-appropriate education about privacy\n    And she should learn why data protection matters\n    And the agent should explain \"Your information is private and protected\"\n    And Emma should begin understanding data as something to steward\n    And consent education should begin at this developmental stage\n\n  Scenario: Transparent boundaries that Emma can understand and learn from\n    Given Emma operates within parental boundaries\n    And she is old enough to understand limits\n    When Emma encounters a boundary (allergen, budget, nutrition)\n    Then the boundary should be explained transparently\n    And the agent should say \"This exceeds the family budget we're working within\"\n    And Emma should see and understand the limits\n    And boundaries should be teaching tools, not just restrictions\n    And she should learn that all autonomy operates within contexts\n    And transparency should build understanding of constraint reasoning\n\n  Scenario: Building neural pathways for care-based economic thinking\n    Given Emma's brain is highly plastic during ages 8-10\n    And repeated patterns shape lifelong thinking\n    When Emma makes value decisions consistently\n    Then she should internalize that resources are for stewardship\n    And she should learn that choices affect others' flourishing\n    And she should understand that care creates value\n    And neural pathways around care economy thinking should form\n    And these patterns should serve her entire life\n    And she should develop alternative to extraction-based economics\n\n  Scenario: Right to genuine autonomy within developmentally appropriate scope\n    Given Emma deserves real agency not simulated choice\n    And she is capable of meaningful decision-making at age 8\n    When Emma uses the Value Scanner\n    Then her choices must be genuinely honored\n    And she must have actual decision-making power\n    And the autonomy must be real within appropriate boundaries\n    And she must experience that her agency matters\n    And constitutional protections apply to her dignity\n    And her humanity requires genuine respect for her capability\n\n  Scenario: Interface designed for developing literacy and numeracy\n    Given Emma is building reading and math skills\n    And she can handle more complexity than younger children\n    When Emma uses the Value Scanner interface\n    Then text should be at appropriate reading level for ages 8-10\n    And comparison tools should support decision-making\n    And basic math support should help with calculating savings\n    And visual aids should supplement text\n    And the interface should feel helpful, not game-like\n    And design should support skill development without frustration\n",
