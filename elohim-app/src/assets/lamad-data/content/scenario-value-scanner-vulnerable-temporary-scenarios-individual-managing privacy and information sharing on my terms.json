  "content": "Scenario: Managing privacy and information sharing on my terms\n    Given I have sensitive information about my situation\n    And multiple institutions are requesting access to my data\n    When I decide what to share and with whom\n    Then the Value Scanner gives me granular control over all data sharing\n    And defaults to maximum privacy protection\n    And clearly explains consequences of sharing vs. not sharing\n    And never shares information without my explicit consent\n    And helps me understand my rights regarding privacy\n    And protects me from institutional coercion to over-share\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to privacy risks\n    And my safety-critical information remains absolutely protected\n",
