  "content": "Scenario: Municipal governance evolution through protocol learning\n    Given Riverside has three years implementing protocol\n    And we have learned what works and what doesn't\n    When I reflect on governance transformation\n    Then I see: city council making better-informed decisions\n    And I notice: residents more engaged through transparency\n    And I observe: faster crisis response with better coordination\n    And I acknowledge: challenges with accessibility and occasional controversy\n    And I understand: protocol enhanced but didn't replace democratic governance\n    And I know: community remains in control through sovereignty and calibration\n    And I have become: leader facilitating partnership with AI not commanding it\n",
