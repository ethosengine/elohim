  "content": "Scenario: Neighborhood watch and safety network for single-parent families\n    Given Maria worries about household and child safety as solo parent\n    And she cannot be everywhere at once\n    When neighborhood safety networks operate\n    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate neighborhood watch efforts\n    And neighbors should look out for each other's children and properties\n    And Maria should feel enhanced security through community vigilance\n    And single-parent households should benefit from neighborhood collective care\n    And safety should be community responsibility, not solo parent burden\n",
