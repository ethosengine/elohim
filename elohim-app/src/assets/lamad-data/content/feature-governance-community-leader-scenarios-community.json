Community-Level Governance Integration for Community Leader\n  As a community_leader in the governance system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want to integrate Elohim Protocol with existing democratic structures\n  So that AI governance serves community flourishing while respecting local sovereignty\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the community_leader user is registered in the system\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And Mayor Jamal Washington leads Riverside (population 45,000)\n\n  Scenario: Adopting Elohim Protocol through community referendum\n    Given Riverside is considering protocol adoption\n    And I am responsible for democratic decision-making process\n    When we conduct community deliberation and vote\n    Then we provide: 6 months of education and pilot testing\n    And we ensure: residents understand what they're choosing\n    And we hold: town halls, demonstrations, Q&A sessions\n    And we offer: transparent information about benefits and risks\n    And we conduct: referendum with 65% approval threshold\n    And we respect: community sovereignty to accept or reject\n    And adoption becomes: democratic mandate not top-down imposition\n    And I am accountable: for implementation serving community values\n\n  Scenario: Mediating between community members and agents\n    Given Community Elohim makes decisions affecting Riverside residents\n    And some residents don't understand or disagree with decisions\n    When I serve as bridge between residents and agent governance\n    Then I explain: how protocol works in accessible language\n    And I facilitate: residents filing appeals when appropriate\n    And I provide: context to Constitutional Council about local culture\n    And I advocate: for residents when agents miss local knowledge\n    And I maintain: boundary where I don't control agents but collaborate\n    And I enable: democratic participation in AI governance\n    And I am accountable: to residents through elections\n\n  Scenario: Providing local context to Constitutional Council deliberations\n    Given community council is reviewing appeal requiring local knowledge\n    And I have information about Riverside history and circumstances\n    When I testify to provide community context\n    Then I explain: relevant history, cultural factors, relationships\n    And I clarify: why something might seem unusual to outsiders\n    And I don't advocate: for particular outcome in appeal\n    And I inform: council's judgment with local wisdom\n    And I respect: council's independence and authority\n    And I enable: constitutional interpretation grounded in reality\n    And community knowledge: enriches democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Identifying patterns in appeals informing local policy\n    Given Constitutional Council has reviewed many Riverside appeals\n    And I observe recurring themes and tensions\n    When I analyze patterns for community improvement\n    Then I see: many adolescent autonomy conflicts emerging\n    And I notice: recurring privacy threshold concerns\n    And I identify: business loan criteria creating frustration\n    And I bring: patterns to city council for policy response\n    And we consider: community-specific protocol calibration\n    And we propose: local ordinance updates if needed\n    And appeals inform: democratic policy making\n    And feedback loop: connects individual recourse to systemic improvement\n\n  Scenario: Calibrating protocol to community-specific values\n    Given Riverside has distinct cultural values and history\n    And we want protocol to reflect our community identity\n    When we engage in community calibration process\n    Then we deliberate: about privacy thresholds (we value privacy highly)\n    And we discuss: resource sharing norms (indigenous heritage influences us)\n    And we consider: how our history affects trust (government betrayal in past)\n    And we vote: on calibrations within constitutional bounds\n    And we implement: community-specific settings\n    And protocol respects: local sovereignty and cultural specificity\n    And we exercise: meaningful self-governance within shared principles\n\n  Scenario: Integrating protocol with existing city governance\n    Given city council still passes ordinances and makes policy\n    And Elohim Protocol augments rather than replaces government\n    When I coordinate protocol with traditional civic structures\n    Then Community Elohim: provides information for council decisions\n    And city council: maintains authority over policy\n    And planning commission: still reviews developments (with agent input)\n    And existing institutions: work alongside protocol\n    And I clarify: boundaries and responsibilities\n    And we avoid: conflicts between agent decisions and local law\n    And integration strengthens: both democratic governance and AI support\n\n  Scenario: Addressing implementation challenges pragmatically\n    Given Riverside faces practical problems with protocol\n    And elderly residents struggle with technology\n    When I work to solve accessibility issues\n    Then we maintain: human service windows for tech-reluctant residents\n    And we offer: paper-based alternatives to digital interfaces\n    And we run: continuous education programs\n    And we provide: in-person support and assistance\n    And we ensure: no resident excluded due to tech barriers\n    And we adapt: implementation to community reality\n    And protocol serves: everyone not just tech-savvy\n\n  Scenario: Funding community protocol infrastructure sustainably\n    Given Riverside needs resources for community nodes and maintenance\n    And we are relatively poor community\n    When I cobble together funding from multiple sources\n    Then we allocate: municipal budget treating this as public infrastructure\n    And we create: community ownership cooperative with resident investment\n    And we apply: for state and federal grants\n    And we participate: in mutual aid with wealthier communities\n    And we ensure: community retains ownership\n    And we plan: for 10-year sustainability not just pilot\n    And public investment: supports democratic governance tools\n\n  Scenario: Demonstrating visible community benefit for reelection\n    Given I face reelection and need to show protocol serves Riverside\n    And residents judge me on outcomes not philosophy\n    When I present annual protocol review to community\n    Then I show: data on wellbeing improvements (loneliness down, satisfaction up)\n    And I report: crisis response effectiveness and economic resilience\n    And I acknowledge: failures and challenges honestly\n    And I demonstrate: transparent accountability\n    And I propose: continuing with recommended calibrations\n    And residents vote: 68% to continue (not consensus but democratic)\n    And I remain accountable: through normal democratic processes\n    And evidence matters: for sustaining political support\n\n  Scenario: Convening deliberative assembly for community conflict\n    Given watershed decision deadlocked agents (agricultural vs ecological)\n    And multi-community coordination is needed\n    When I convene deliberative assembly with affected communities\n    Then we bring together: upstream and downstream stakeholders\n    And we facilitate: structured deliberation about shared resources\n    And we explore: synthesis honoring multiple values\n    And we enable: democratic resolution of agent conflicts\n    And we reach: agreement on graduated resource sharing\n    And deliberative democracy: resolves what algorithms couldn't\n    And I demonstrate: leadership as facilitation not command\n\n  Scenario: Protecting protocol sovereignty from state overreach\n    Given state government attempts regulation compromising protocol\n    And I believe this violates community sovereignty\n    When I advocate for protecting local autonomy\n    Then I testify: at state legislative hearings\n    And I coalition: with other community leaders\n    And I present: evidence that regulation would harm local governance\n    And I defend: subsidiarity principle and community choice\n    And I resist: one-size-fits-all mandates from higher layers\n    And I maintain: that communities adopted protocol voluntarily\n    And I protect: democratic self-governance\n\n  Scenario: Sharing implementation wisdom with other community leaders\n    Given I have three years experience implementing protocol in Riverside\n    And other mayors considering adoption seek my advice\n    When I share honest assessment of benefits and challenges\n    Then I describe: what worked (community calibration, Constitutional Council)\n    And I acknowledge: what struggled (elderly accessibility, some controversy)\n    And I explain: factors predicting success (community buy-in, resources, patience)\n    And I provide: practical implementation guidance\n    And I offer: not utopia but better than what we had\n    And I emphasize: communities control adoption speed and approach\n    And peer network: enables learning across communities\n\n  Scenario: Planning for crisis response maintaining democratic oversight\n    Given emergencies require rapid coordination\n    And I must balance speed with democratic legitimacy\n    When I establish crisis response protocols\n    Then Community Elohim: helps coordinate response rapidly\n    And I maintain: human judgment for crisis decisions\n    And Constitutional Council: provides oversight even under urgency\n    And emergency powers: have clear limits and sunset provisions\n    And we preserve: democratic accountability during crisis\n    And we plan: for resilience without sacrificing governance principles\n    And we demonstrate: democracy can be both deliberative and responsive\n\n  Scenario: Preparing community for potential authoritarian resistance\n    Given authoritarian threat to protocol might emerge\n    And I plan for protecting community sovereignty\n    When I establish contingency plans for resistance\n    Then we maintain: encrypted backups of community data\n    And we prepare: mesh networking for internet disruption\n    And we identify: sanctuary partners (university, churches)\n    And we plan: civil disobedience protocols if needed\n    And we retain: community fork option as last resort\n    And we hope: never to use these\n    And we know: community sovereignty matters more than protocol uniformity\n",
