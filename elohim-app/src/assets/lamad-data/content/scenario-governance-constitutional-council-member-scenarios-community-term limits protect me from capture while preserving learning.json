  "content": "Scenario: Term limits protect me from capture while preserving learning\n    Given I have served my 3-month community council term\n    And I have developed constitutional literacy and deliberation skills\n    When my term ends and I return to nursing work\n    Then I cannot: serve consecutive terms or be reappointed\n    And I cannot: build career in council governance\n    And I am protected: from lobbying, corruption, or capture\n    And I carry forward: constitutional understanding into community life\n    And I remain: engaged citizen with enhanced democratic capacity\n    And my institutional knowledge: is preserved through documentation\n    And fresh perspectives: replace mine to prevent ossification\n",
