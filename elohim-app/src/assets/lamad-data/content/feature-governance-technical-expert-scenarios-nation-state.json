National-Level Technical Expertise for Constitutional Governance\n  As a technical_expert in the governance system\n  Operating at the nation_state governance layer\n  I want to advise on national constitutional questions involving technical complexity\n  So that democratic governance of AI is informed by technical reality\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the technical_expert user is registered in the system\n    And the nation_state governance context is active\n    And Dr. Amara Okonkwo advises National Constitutional Council\n\n  Scenario: Advising National Council on fundamental constitutional tension\n    Given National Council deliberates care vs privacy at constitutional level\n    And technical capabilities shape what's constitutionally possible\n    When I testify about technical constraints and possibilities\n    Then I explain: what surveillance capabilities would enable better care\n    And I clarify: technical limits on achieving privacy while providing protection\n    And I present: tradeoff between optimization and dignity\n    And I stop: before dictating which values should prevail\n    And I inform: constitutional interpretation with technical reality\n    And I respect: that council must choose values not just optimize outcomes\n    And I demonstrate: expertise serving democratic judgment\n\n  Scenario: Explaining cryptographic impossibility of backdoor mandates\n    Given policy makers consider requiring backdoors for law enforcement\n    And this would break constitutional verification\n    When I testify to National Council about technical implications\n    Then I explain: backdoors make cryptographic alignment proof impossible\n    And I clarify: cannot have both backdoors and constitutional verification\n    And I demonstrate: this is mathematical fact not implementation choice\n    And I present: security vulnerabilities backdoors create\n    And I acknowledge: this constrains what governance can mandate\n    And I provide: evidence policy makers need for informed choice\n    And I maintain: that I'm explaining constraints not dictating values\n\n  Scenario: Assessing whether national protocol standard violates constitution\n    Given appellant challenges nationwide implementation standard\n    And National Council must evaluate technical conformance\n    When I audit national protocol against constitutional principles\n    Then I examine: whether implementation drifted from constitutional alignment\n    And I verify: cryptographic proofs across national deployment\n    And I identify: systematic technical issues affecting millions\n    And I assess: whether correction is feasible\n    And I provide: honest evaluation even if unflattering to protocol\n    And I serve: truth-telling and constitutional accountability\n    And my independence: enables genuine oversight\n\n  Scenario: Advising on national security vs constitutional rights tension\n    Given appeal involves claimed national security justification\n    And technical assessment is needed of security claims\n    When I evaluate security-rights tradeoff technically\n    Then I assess: whether claimed vulnerability is technically legitimate\n    And I explore: whether less rights-violating technical alternatives exist\n    And I examine: whether proposed security measure would actually work\n    And I clarify: technical reality vs security theater\n    And I avoid: dismissing security needs or exaggerating threats\n    And I provide: honest technical assessment\n    And I let: council judge values tradeoff given technical facts\n\n  Scenario: Participating in national technical standards development\n    Given national protocol standards need technical specification\n    And I serve on standards development committee\n    When I help craft technical requirements\n    Then I ensure: standards serve constitutional principles\n    And I verify: specifications are implementable\n    And I check: for security vulnerabilities in standards\n    And I collaborate: with diverse technical experts\n    And I submit: standards to National Constitutional Council for approval\n    And I demonstrate: technical development serving democratic governance\n    And citizens authorize: technical changes through council oversight\n\n  Scenario: Explaining limitations of explainability for complex reasoning\n    Given National Council considers requiring perfect explainability\n    And I must clarify technical feasibility\n    When I testify about explainability tradeoffs\n    Then I explain: perfect explainability may be impossible for superintelligent reasoning\n    And I clarify: tradeoff between transparency and capability\n    And I present: current state of explainability research\n    And I acknowledge: we don't know if problem is solvable\n    And I avoid: either dismissing explainability importance or promising impossibility\n    And I enable: council to make informed choice despite uncertainty\n    And delegates decide: values given technical constraints\n\n  Scenario: Testifying to congressional committee on protocol security\n    Given Congress considers legislation affecting protocol\n    And technical security assessment is needed\n    When I testify to legislative committee\n    Then I explain: cryptographic foundations and their robustness\n    And I assess: attack vectors and defense mechanisms\n    And I clarify: what regulation would help vs harm security\n    And I present: evidence from adversarial testing\n    And I maintain: independence from political pressure\n    And I avoid: either advocacy or false neutrality\n    And I serve: informed democratic policy making\n\n  Scenario: Collaborating with national research on protocol effectiveness\n    Given Dr. Chen studies national sortition governance patterns\n    And my technical expertise complements his social science\n    When we collaborate on research\n    Then I explain: technical mechanisms enabling democratic oversight\n    And I help: interpret technical aspects of council decisions\n    And I provide: data on agent behavior patterns\n    And I respect: his expertise on social and political dynamics\n    And we integrate: technical and democratic perspectives\n    And collaboration produces: richer understanding than either alone\n    And research serves: evidence-based governance improvement\n\n  Scenario: Identifying need for capability limits until problems solved\n    Given agents approach human comprehension limits\n    And National Council questions if oversight remains meaningful\n    When I assess whether democratic governance can continue\n    Then I honestly acknowledge: limits of our technical understanding\n    And I clarify: what can and cannot be verified currently\n    And I explore: research pathways to better explainability\n    And I may recommend: limiting agent capability until oversight works\n    And I accept: that this may slow AI development\n    And I prioritize: democratic governance over technical optimization\n    And I demonstrate: humility about technological limits\n\n  Scenario: Advising on national constitutional amendment technical implications\n    Given adolescent autonomy amendment is proposed\n    And technical implementation is uncertain\n    When I explain implementation possibilities to National Council\n    Then I clarify: how agents would operationalize new constitutional principle\n    And I assess: technical challenges in implementation\n    And I identify: what research or development would be needed\n    And I avoid: either blocking amendment due to difficulty or ignoring challenges\n    And I enable: informed democratic choice about constitutional evolution\n    And I serve: constitutional amendment process with technical honesty\n\n  Scenario: Peer reviewing other expert testimony for quality assurance\n    Given multiple experts advise National Council\n    And peer review prevents individual capture or error\n    When I review fellow expert's testimony\n    Then I assess: technical accuracy and completeness\n    And I identify: bias or conflicts of interest\n    And I check: if alternative interpretations exist\n    And I verify: adherence to testimony guidelines\n    And I provide: constructive critique\n    And I accept: critique of my own testimony\n    And peer review: maintains expertise quality and independence\n\n  Scenario: Contributing to national appellant bill of rights implementation\n    Given National Council established detailed appellant rights\n    And technical implementation is needed\n    When I help design systems supporting these rights\n    Then I specify: technical requirements for appeal interfaces\n    And I design: precedent search and tracking systems\n    And I ensure: accessibility for users with disabilities\n    And I implement: privacy protections for sensitive appeals\n    And I test: that systems actually serve appellant rights\n    And I demonstrate: technical development implementing constitutional values\n\n  Scenario: Grappling with my influence on decisions affecting millions\n    Given my testimony shapes National Council decisions\n    And those decisions affect millions of people\n    When I reflect on the weight of my responsibility\n    Then I feel: burden of expertise influencing democratic governance\n    And I worry: about errors in my analysis causing harm\n    And I accept: that I must act under uncertainty\n    And I commit: to honesty about my limitations\n    And I trust: democratic process to weigh my input appropriately\n    And I practice: epistemic humility while still providing expertise\n    And I demonstrate: expertise serving democracy despite uncertainty\n",
