  "content": "Scenario: Traditional sustainable practices preserved through elder teaching\n    Given Helen learned pre-consumer household management\n    And she knows seasonal food preservation, waste reduction, and resource conservation\n    When Helen teaches traditional sustainable practices\n    Then her knowledge should be recognized as environmental education\n    And younger generations should learn low-impact living from her experience\n    And traditional practices should inform modern sustainability efforts\n    And Helen should be valued as expert in sustainable living\n    And the protocol should facilitate skills transfer from pre-disposable era\n    And ecological wisdom should be preserved through intergenerational teaching\n    And Helen's knowledge should contribute to reduced environmental impact\n",
