  "content": "Scenario: Studying trust building through transparent governance\n    Given trust in institutions is central question for democratic AI\n    And Riverside provides natural experiment in transparency effects\n    When I measure trust over time and mechanisms that build it\n    Then I examine: whether seeing agent reasoning increases confidence\n    And I explore: if meaningful recourse builds trust more than perfect decisions\n    And I analyze: role of local Constitutional Council in legitimacy\n    And I investigate: whether transparency enables manipulation or builds confidence\n    And I track: how trust relationships between residents and agents evolve\n    And My research tests: whether democratic governance of AI creates sustainable trust\n    And Evidence informs: design of governance systems elsewhere\n",
