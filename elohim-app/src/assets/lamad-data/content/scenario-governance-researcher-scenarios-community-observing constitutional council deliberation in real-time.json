  "content": "Scenario: Observing Constitutional Council deliberation in real-time\n    Given Community Constitutional Council is reviewing Marcus's mental health appeal\n    And I have permission to observe their deliberation\n    When I document how the council works through the case\n    Then I capture: argument patterns, member interactions, uncertainty navigation\n    And I analyze: how expertise influences judgment, how dissent gets resolved\n    And I examine: quality of deliberation, constitutional reasoning depth\n    And I observe: what enables effective citizen governance\n    And I document: dynamics that retrospective analysis would miss\n    And My research reveals how sortition democracy actually works\n    And Findings feed back to improve council support and training\n",
