  "content": "Scenario: Ruling against agent decision when constitutional bounds exceeded\n    Given I am reviewing an appeal where agent clearly overstepped\n    And the facts show the decision violated constitutional principles\n    When our council rules the agent decision unconstitutional\n    Then the decision is: immediately overturned\n    And appellant's preferences are: automatically restored\n    And the incident is: documented as error in agent's record\n    And similar interventions: require higher thresholds going forward\n    And protocol improvements are: proposed and implemented\n    And agent learns: from legitimate critique without being punished\n    And accountability works: without compromising agent autonomy\n",
