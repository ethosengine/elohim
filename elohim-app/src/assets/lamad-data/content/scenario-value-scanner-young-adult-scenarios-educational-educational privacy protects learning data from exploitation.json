  "content": "Scenario: Educational privacy protects learning data from exploitation\n    Given Aisha's learning patterns generate valuable data\n    And educational data is often exploited commercially\n    When educational data is collected\n    Then it must be used only to improve educational outcomes\n    And Aisha's privacy must be absolutely protected\n    And no commercial exploitation of learning data should occur\n    And data should serve her learning, not surveillance capitalism\n    And educational privacy must be maintained\n    And learning should never be monetized\n",
