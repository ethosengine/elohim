Community Layer Value Recognition for Retired Person\n  As a retired person in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want my volunteer labor and community leadership recognized as valuable contribution\n  So that retired people are understood as community builders, not economic dependents\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the retired user \"Frank\" is registered in the system\n    And Frank is 70 years old, retired from construction\n    And Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates community care economy\n    And Frank's construction skills serve community housing needs\n\n  Scenario: Skilled volunteer labor valued at market rates for community contribution\n    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week with Habitat for Humanity\n    And he provides skilled construction labor\n    And this work has clear market value (~$40/hour for skilled trades)\n    When the community_elohim tracks volunteer contributions\n    Then Frank's volunteer labor should be quantified specifically\n    And market value should be calculated (~$20k/year contribution)\n    And his skilled labor should be recognized as substantial community asset\n    And community care tokens should accumulate from volunteer work\n    And Frank should see quantified value of his contribution\n    And the narrative of retired as \"not contributing\" should be countered\n    And community should recognize his volunteer work as real economic value\n\n  Scenario: Habitat for Humanity work recognized as housing care economy contribution\n    Given Frank's volunteer work builds housing for families in need\n    And his construction expertise enables affordable housing\n    When the community_elohim tracks housing care economy\n    Then Frank's work should be recognized as addressing housing crisis\n    And building homes should be valued as community care contribution\n    And his labor should be connected to housing outcomes (families housed)\n    And community should see that Frank's work creates housing that policy fails to provide\n    And volunteer construction should be understood as care economy infrastructure\n    And Frank should experience his work as meaningful community contribution\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating volunteer participation with other life commitments\n    Given Frank volunteers 20 hours/week\n    And he also provides family care and participates in neighborhood governance\n    When the community_elohim coordinates his participation\n    Then it should integrate volunteer work with other commitments\n    And help Frank maintain sustainable participation level\n    And prevent volunteer burnout through overcommitment\n    And coordinate scheduling across community, family, and neighborhood\n    And support Frank in balancing diverse care contributions\n    And enable long-term sustainable volunteer engagement\n\n  Scenario: Retired residents as experienced community leaders and organizers\n    Given Frank has decades of community experience\n    And he understands community dynamics and history\n    When the community_elohim facilitates leadership\n    Then Frank's accumulated experience should position him for leadership\n    And his knowledge should inform community organizing and policy\n    And community should actively seek his participation in decision-making\n    And decades of community investment should confer legitimate authority\n    And elder leadership should be welcomed and valued\n    And Frank should experience himself as community leader, not marginal participant\n\n  Scenario: Mentoring younger volunteers in construction and community work\n    Given Frank has both construction expertise and volunteering experience\n    And younger volunteers need skill development and guidance\n    When the community_elohim coordinates mentoring\n    Then it should connect Frank to volunteers seeking construction skills\n    And facilitate teaching and skill transmission\n    And recognize mentoring as multiplying Frank's contribution\n    And value teaching labor as care contribution\n    And build community capacity through intergenerational skill sharing\n    And Frank should experience meaningful role as mentor and teacher\n\n  Scenario: Community care tokens accumulate from sustained volunteer participation\n    Given Frank has volunteered consistently over years\n    And his contributions are substantial and ongoing\n    When the community_elohim calculates care tokens\n    Then tokens should accumulate from Frank's volunteer hours\n    And skill level should affect token value (skilled trades valued highly)\n    And sustained participation should be recognized over time\n    And accumulated tokens should represent Frank's community standing\n    And tokens should create claims on community resources and support\n    And his years of contribution should be visible and valued\n\n  Scenario: Connecting retired residents to volunteer opportunities matching their skills\n    Given Frank has construction expertise\n    And community has diverse volunteer needs\n    When the community_elohim matches volunteers to opportunities\n    Then it should identify opportunities utilizing Frank's specific skills\n    And surface construction-related needs beyond Habitat\n    And coordinate with organizations seeking skilled volunteers\n    And help Frank find meaningful work aligned with expertise\n    And maximize community benefit from his particular capabilities\n    And enable Frank to contribute at highest skill level\n\n  Scenario: Volunteer work accessibility for aging participants\n    Given Frank is 70 and managing age-related physical changes\n    And he wants to continue contributing through volunteer work\n    When the community_elohim coordinates accessibility\n    Then it should match Frank to work appropriate for his capabilities\n    And surface modifications that enable continued participation\n    And recognize when physical limitations require adaptation\n    And help transition to less physically demanding roles if needed\n    And protect Frank's safety while maximizing contribution\n    And enable continued meaningful participation throughout aging\n\n  Scenario: Community governance includes retired residents as active participants\n    Given Frank and other retired residents have time for civic engagement\n    And they have accumulated community knowledge and experience\n    When the community_elohim facilitates governance\n    Then it should actively include retired residents in decision-making\n    And their time availability should enable substantial governance participation\n    And their experience should inform community policy and planning\n    And community decisions should benefit from elder wisdom\n    And retired residents should be understood as governance resources, not dependents\n    And Frank should participate in shaping community direction\n\n  Scenario: Retired residents build care economy infrastructure through organizing\n    Given Frank and other retired residents have time for organizing\n    And care economy requires coordination and infrastructure\n    When the community_elohim supports infrastructure building\n    Then it should enable retired residents to organize care economy systems\n    And coordinate tool libraries, skill shares, mutual aid networks\n    And facilitate care coordination that benefits all community members\n    And recognize organizing labor as valuable care contribution\n    And retired residents should be understood as infrastructure builders\n    And Frank should help establish care economy as normal community practice\n\n  Scenario: Community education and skill-sharing led by retired residents\n    Given Frank has decades of construction knowledge\n    And community members need practical skills\n    When the community_elohim coordinates education\n    Then it should facilitate Frank teaching construction workshops\n    And coordinate skill-sharing sessions utilizing retired residents' expertise\n    And recognize teaching as valuable community care contribution\n    And enable knowledge transmission from experienced to learning members\n    And build community capacity through elder knowledge sharing\n    And Frank should experience meaningful teaching role\n\n  Scenario: Community resource allocation recognizes volunteer contributions\n    Given Frank provides substantial volunteer labor\n    And community resources are limited\n    When the community_elohim influences resource allocation\n    Then Frank's contributions should be visible in allocation decisions\n    And his care tokens should provide access to community resources\n    And volunteers should not face additional burden from low income\n    And community resources should flow to contributors equitably\n    And Frank's volunteer work should be recognized through material support\n    And care economy should function as mutual aid, not charity\n\n  Scenario: Visibility of aggregate retired resident contributions transforms perception\n    Given Frank is one of many retired residents contributing substantial volunteer labor\n    And aggregate impact is significant but invisible in traditional metrics\n    When the community_elohim surfaces aggregate data\n    Then it should quantify total volunteer labor from retired residents\n    And calculate combined market value (potentially millions annually)\n    And demonstrate that retired residents are massive community asset\n    And counter narrative of elders as economic burden\n    And transform community understanding of retirement contributions\n    And support policy that recognizes and values retired resident participation\n    And Frank should see himself as part of powerful community infrastructure\n",
