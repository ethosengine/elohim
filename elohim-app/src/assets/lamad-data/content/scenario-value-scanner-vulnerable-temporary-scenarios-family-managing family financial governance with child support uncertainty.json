  "content": "Scenario: Managing family financial governance with child support uncertainty\n    Given I am supposed to receive child support but it's unreliable\n    And family finances are therefore unpredictable\n    When I manage family financial planning with uncertain child support\n    Then the family_elohim helps me plan for multiple scenarios\n    And tracks child support payments and non-payments\n    And documents non-payment for legal enforcement if needed\n    And helps me make financial decisions despite uncertainty\n    And connects me to legal resources for child support enforcement\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to missing payments\n    And recognizes management of financial uncertainty as cognitive labor\n    And validates that unreliable support makes everything harder\n",
