Community Wealth Reclamation Through Franchise Conversion\n  As a franchise_operator in the autonomous_entity system\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want franchise locations to transform from extraction sites to community institutions\n  So that neighborhood wealth circulates locally instead of extracting to distant corporation\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And James's three ChickenMax franchises were extracting wealth from neighborhoods\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And conversion enables reclaiming locations as community institutions\n\n  Scenario: Franchise extraction to distant shareholders is replaced by local wealth circulation\n    Given franchise locations extracted $120K annually to corporate (fees and markups across three locations)\n    And profits beyond operator's modest take also left community\n    When conversion eliminates corporate extraction and distributes value locally\n    Then $120K annually circulates in neighborhood economies instead of extracting\n    And workers earning higher wages spend locally, multiplying community benefit\n    And community programs receive funding from value previously extracted\n    And wealth circulation is documented showing dramatic shift from extraction to community benefit\n    And community_elohim tracks neighborhood economic impact of conversion\n\n  Scenario: Anonymous franchise locations become known community institutions\n    Given ChickenMax #247, #248, #249 were corporate outposts without local identity\n    And community members saw them as extractive chains, not neighborhood businesses\n    When conversion makes locations democratically-governed community institutions\n    Then neighborhoods learn their franchise locations chose democratic ownership\n    And locations develop distinct community identities (possibly rebranding with local names)\n    And community members recognize workers as co-owners, not exploited employees\n    And institutions become sources of neighborhood pride instead of corporate extraction symbols\n    And community_elohim communicates conversion story building community ownership\n\n  Scenario: Franchise operator's community standing transforms through conversion choice\n    Given James was invisible behind ChickenMax brand despite owning locations\n    And community saw franchise locations as corporate, didn't know operator existed\n    When James's conversion choice becomes visible to neighborhoods\n    Then community learns he chose democratic ownership over continuing corporate extraction\n    And neighbors respect decision to prioritize workers and community wealth\n    And his standing shifts from anonymous franchise operator to community member who chose well\n    And conversion demonstrates operators can be allies in community wealth-building\n    And community_elohim helps communicate operator's conversion choice and values\n\n  Scenario: Community investment enables conversion while building local ownership stake\n    Given conversion requires $750K acquisition capital for three locations\n    And community members want to support democratic ownership but lacked pathway\n    When community investment pools fund significant portion of acquisition\n    Then neighbors invest modest amounts ($2K-$20K each) in conversion\n    And investors receive fair return (5% annually) plus social benefit\n    And community gains financial stake in democratically-operated local institutions\n    And investment connects neighbors to democratic economy building in their community\n    And community_elohim manages community investment relationships transparently\n\n  Scenario: Franchise locations become community gathering spaces beyond commercial function\n    Given corporate franchise design optimized for transaction speed, not community connection\n    And neighborhoods lacked accessible gathering spaces for organizing\n    When democratic governance considers community space usage\n    Then locations offer meeting space for neighborhood organizing after business hours\n    And community bulletin boards share local information and mutual aid opportunities\n    And youth employment programs connect young people to food service work with dignity\n    And spaces become community hubs serving social needs beyond food service\n    And community_elohim facilitates community programming in democratic business spaces\n\n  Scenario: Community accountability ensures democratic locations serve neighborhood needs\n    Given franchise corporate ignored community needs in pursuit of profit maximization\n    And locations had no mechanism for community input on operations\n    When democratic governance includes community stakeholder participation\n    Then neighborhood residents can attend stakeholder meetings and provide input\n    And community concerns about impacts (environmental, traffic, employment) are heard\n    And workers consider community feedback in democratic decision-making\n    And accountability flows both ways (community and workers mutually accountable)\n    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation protecting worker autonomy\n\n  Scenario: Neighborhood youth gain employment pathways with dignity and ownership potential\n    Given franchise locations offered poverty-wage jobs with no advancement or ownership\n    And youth employment was exploitative, not developmental\n    When democratic governance creates dignified youth employment programs\n    Then neighborhood youth earn living wages ($18/hour) with training and support\n    And employment includes path to worker ownership for committed participants\n    And youth experience democratic governance, not hierarchical exploitation\n    And community youth economic opportunity improves dramatically through local democratic businesses\n    And community_elohim documents youth employment outcomes and advancement pathways\n\n  Scenario: Local supplier relationships strengthen through franchise purchasing liberation\n    Given franchise mandatory purchasing prevented supporting local suppliers\n    And community wealth extracted through corporate supply chain\n    When purchasing autonomy enables local sourcing decisions\n    Then democratic locations source from Johnson Farm and neighborhood suppliers\n    And supply chain spending circulates in community, not extracting to national distributors\n    And supplier relationships become partnerships benefiting both parties\n    And transparent supply chain shows community members how their spending supports local economy\n    And community_elohim coordinates local supply relationships for maximum community benefit\n\n  Scenario: Community resilience increases through democratic business network\n    Given isolated franchise locations were vulnerable to corporate closure decisions\n    And closures destroyed community institutions based on distant profit calculations\n    When converted locations join EAE network of mutual support\n    Then businesses survive economic downturns through network coordination\n    And community institutions are protected from arbitrary corporate closure\n    And democratic businesses support each other rather than competing for corporate favor\n    And neighborhood economic stability improves through resilient democratic business network\n    And community_elohim coordinates network support for community economic resilience\n\n  Scenario: Franchise conversion sparks community organizing and economic democracy awareness\n    Given successful conversion demonstrates economic democracy is possible locally\n    And community members didn't know democratic alternatives to corporate extraction existed\n    When neighborhoods celebrate successful conversion and its benefits\n    Then community organizing emerges advocating for more democratic conversions\n    And residents learn they can influence local economy through supporting democratic businesses\n    And economic democracy becomes part of neighborhood political consciousness\n    And conversion inspires broader community action for economic justice\n    And community_elohim supports emerging community organizing around economic democracy\n\n  Scenario: Environmental impacts improve through community-accountable governance\n    Given franchise corporate externalized environmental costs for profit maximization\n    And community bore environmental impacts (waste, pollution, resource depletion)\n    When democratic governance includes environmental stewardship accountability\n    Then waste reduction and recycling programs are implemented\n    And sustainable sourcing (local, organic, regenerative) is prioritized\n    And environmental practices are transparent to community\n    And community can hold democratic businesses accountable for environmental impacts\n    And community_elohim tracks environmental improvements from democratic governance\n\n  Scenario: Community celebrates conversion success as neighborhood economic development\n    Given economic development announcements typically celebrate corporate recruitment\n    And franchise conversions deserve equal celebration as community wealth-building\n    When conversions demonstrate success through measurable community benefits\n    Then neighborhood organizations and local media celebrate democratic ownership\n    And community events honor workers' ownership and James's conversion choice\n    And public celebration builds awareness and political support for democratic economy\n    And success story encourages other franchise operators and business owners to consider conversion\n    And community_elohim coordinates celebration events amplifying democratic economy visibility\n",
