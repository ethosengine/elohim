  "content": "Scenario: Manager participates in democratic ownership as worker-peer\n    Given Marcus's coordinator role doesn't exclude him from worker-ownership\n    And his governance weight reflects his facilitation contribution\n    When major strategic decisions are made (profit distribution, reinvestment, etc.)\n    Then Marcus participates as worker-owner with weighted voice\n    And his coordination role is valued but doesn't grant special ownership privilege\n    And his tokens accumulate based on witnessed contribution like all workers\n    And he benefits from collective success he helps facilitate\n    And workplace_elohim prevents coordinator role from becoming ownership concentration\n",
