Community Layer Value Recognition for Student\n  As a student building care networks in temporary community\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want to participate in student mutual aid and broader community care economy\n  So that I develop reciprocal relationships that provide support and teach community building\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the student user \"Kenji\" is registered in the system\n    And Kenji participates in student community at his college\n    And Kenji is geographically separated from family care networks\n    And Kenji needs to build community support in temporary college setting\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim could coordinate care economy networks\n    And student community includes formal organizations and informal mutual aid\n\n  Scenario: Student mutual aid networks as care economy foundation\n    Given Kenji participates in student mutual aid group\n    And students share resources, knowledge, and support\n    When the community_elohim tracks mutual aid participation\n    Then it should recognize meal sharing as care contribution\n    And it should value textbook lending, note sharing, and skill exchange\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for helping other students\n    And mutual aid should be understood as care economy practice\n    And the system should make reciprocal support visible\n    And student mutual aid should be recognized as community building\n\n  Scenario: Emergency support through student community networks\n    Given Kenji faces unexpected crisis (medical emergency, financial shortfall, housing instability)\n    And formal institutions often respond too slowly\n    When student community provides emergency support\n    Then the community_elohim should coordinate rapid mutual aid\n    And it should help students pool resources for peer emergency\n    And it should recognize emergency care as high-value contribution\n    And it should track \"Maya loaned Kenji $100 for urgent medical cost\"\n    And community should function as immediate safety net\n    And student mutual aid should provide crisis intervention\n\n  Scenario: Knowledge and skill sharing in student community\n    Given Kenji has environmental science knowledge\n    And other students have different expertise\n    When students share knowledge freely\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize teaching as care work\n    And it should value Kenji explaining organic chemistry to struggling peer\n    And it should track peer tutoring as community contribution\n    And knowledge sharing should accumulate care tokens\n    And the system should foster culture of generous knowledge exchange\n    And intellectual support should be recognized as care labor\n\n  Scenario: Food sharing and collective cooking in student community\n    Given many students face food insecurity\n    And collective meals reduce individual costs\n    When Kenji participates in community meal sharing\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize communal feeding as care work\n    And it should value both cooking for others and hosting shared meals\n    And it should track \"Kenji cooked dinner for 8 people in study group\"\n    And food sharing should be core care economy practice\n    And the system should make nutrition care visible and valued\n    And collective eating should build community bonds\n\n  Scenario: Mental health and emotional support in student community\n    Given students face high stress, anxiety, and mental health challenges\n    And formal mental health services are often inadequate\n    When students provide emotional support to peers\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize emotional labor as care work\n    And it should value listening, validating, and supporting peers in crisis\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for emotional care work\n    And mental health support should be understood as community care\n    And the system should validate peer emotional support as real work\n    And student community should be recognized as mental health resource\n\n  Scenario: Collective advocacy for student needs and rights\n    Given students face systemic challenges (inadequate financial aid, housing costs, food insecurity)\n    And collective action can create change\n    When Kenji participates in student organizing\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize advocacy as care contribution\n    And it should value organizing work, protest participation, and policy advocacy\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for working toward collective flourishing\n    And advocacy labor should be recognized as community care work\n    And the system should support student collective action\n    And organizing for justice should be valued as care economy participation\n\n  Scenario: Building community across identity and affinity groups\n    Given student community includes diverse identity groups\n    And Kenji might participate in environmental student org, cultural groups, academic communities\n    When Kenji bridges across different student communities\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize bridge-building as care work\n    And it should value work connecting different student networks\n    And it should show how diverse relationships strengthen overall community\n    And coalition building should accumulate care tokens\n    And the system should foster inclusive, interconnected community\n    And students should learn to build community across difference\n\n  Scenario: Temporary community building as lifelong skill\n    Given Kenji's college community is temporary\n    And he will leave after graduation\n    When the personal_agent reflects on community participation\n    Then it should help Kenji see community building as transferable skill\n    And it should validate that temporary communities are still real\n    And it should teach him that community is built through care relationships\n    And the agent should help him understand he'll build community wherever he goes\n    And the system should frame student community as practice for lifelong participation\n    And Kenji should learn that community is created, not just inherited\n\n  Scenario: Access to community resources during extreme scarcity\n    Given Kenji lives on $180/week and might face emergencies\n    And community food banks, clothing closets, and support services exist\n    When Kenji needs community resources\n    Then the community_elohim should connect him to available support\n    And it should reduce shame and barriers to access\n    And it should frame receiving support as participating in care economy\n    And it should recognize that receiving care is part of reciprocity\n    And the system should normalize community resource sharing\n    And students should access community support with dignity\n\n  Scenario: Community care during academic pressure peaks\n    Given exam periods create intense stress across student community\n    And everyone is struggling simultaneously\n    When student community provides collective support during finals\n    Then the community_elohim should coordinate mutual care\n    And it should recognize study space hosting, meal provision, emotional support\n    And it should value care work that helps community through crisis period\n    And collective survival should be recognized as care economy\n    And the system should support community resilience\n    And students should learn that community carries each other through hard times\n\n  Scenario: Student community as political and cultural force\n    Given students are networked, idealistic, and trend-setting\n    And student movements have historically created cultural change\n    When student community adopts care economy practices\n    Then the community_elohim should recognize students as change agents\n    And it should support spread of care economy culture among students\n    And it should help students see themselves as building alternative economy\n    And student community should be recognized as site for cultural transformation\n    And the system should empower students as care economy pioneers\n    And student adoption could spread care economy to broader generation\n\n  Scenario: Documenting community care contributions for future recognition\n    Given Kenji's community care work is currently invisible to traditional economy\n    And his care tokens accumulate throughout college\n    When Kenji graduates and enters workforce\n    Then his care token history should document community leadership and care skills\n    And it should translate community organizing to \"proven leadership capability\"\n    And it should show mutual aid coordination as \"project management expertise\"\n    And community care work should be valuable on employment terms\n    And the system should help Kenji articulate care economy participation professionally\n    And student community work should be recognized as career-relevant experience\n\n  Scenario: Privacy and consent in community data sharing\n    Given community coordination requires some information sharing\n    And Kenji has full privacy rights\n    When the community_elohim manages community information\n    Then Kenji must control what community data is shared\n    And his participation should be visible only with his consent\n    And community care should not require surveillance\n    And privacy should be protected while enabling coordination\n    And the system should balance community connection with individual privacy\n    And Kenji should participate in community on his own terms\n",
