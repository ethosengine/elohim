  "content": "Scenario: Peer reviewing global expert testimony across cultures\n    Given experts from diverse technical traditions advise convention\n    And peer review must work across different epistemologies\n    When I review testimony from non-Western technical expert\n    Then I respect: different approaches to technical knowledge\n    And I identify: complementary insights from diverse perspectives\n    And I avoid: dismissing unfamiliar technical traditions\n    And I learn: from different ways of understanding AI systems\n    And I strengthen: testimony through cross-cultural dialogue\n    And I demonstrate: epistemic humility and global collaboration\n",
