Community Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent\n  As a single parent participating in community care economy\n  Operating at the community governance layer\n  I want to access community resources based on care contributions, not charity\n  So that I receive dignified support for my superhuman care work without stigma\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the single parent user \"Maria\" is registered in the system\n    And Maria performs extraordinary care labor as sole parent of three children\n    And she earns $42k/year supporting household of four\n    And the community governance context is active\n    And the community_elohim coordinates community-level care economy\n    And community includes mutual aid networks, support organizations, and resources\n\n  Scenario: Care token standing qualifies Maria for community support without means-testing\n    Given Maria has accumulated substantial care tokens from solo parenting work\n    And she needs access to community resources due to resource constraints\n    When Maria seeks community support\n    Then her care contributions should qualify her for support with dignity\n    And support should be based on demonstrated care work, not proving neediness\n    And Maria should access resources as care economy participant, not charity recipient\n    And community support should recognize her contributions, not pity her circumstances\n    And care economy should frame assistance as reciprocity, not welfare\n\n  Scenario: Single parent mutual aid network provides peer support and resources\n    Given Maria shares specific challenges with other single parents\n    And they can support each other in ways non-single-parents cannot\n    When Maria connects to community single parent networks\n    Then the community_elohim should facilitate single parent mutual aid\n    And it should coordinate resource sharing specific to solo parenting needs\n    And it should enable peer support among those with lived experience\n    And single parent network should provide understanding and practical help\n    And Maria should have community that truly comprehends solo parenting reality\n\n  Scenario: Food security support accessed with dignity through care economy\n    Given Maria's $175/week grocery budget for four people is severely constrained\n    And food security is essential for family well-being\n    When Maria's economic status qualifies her for food support\n    Then the community_elohim should connect her to food assistance programs\n    And support should be framed as care economy reciprocity, not charity\n    And Maria should access help without stigmatizing means-testing processes\n    And her massive care contributions should be recognized as qualifying her for support\n    And food assistance should be dignified and adequate for family needs\n\n  Scenario: Emergency financial assistance during crisis without bureaucratic humiliation\n    Given single parents face financial emergencies without partner backup\n    And traditional assistance requires invasive documentation and waiting\n    When Maria faces financial crisis\u2014medical bill, car repair, unexpected expense\n    Then the community_elohim should coordinate rapid emergency assistance\n    And help should be available quickly based on care economy standing\n    And Maria should not have to prove desperation through bureaucratic gauntlet\n    And emergency support should preserve dignity while providing real help\n    And care economy should function as community safety net for crisis\n\n  Scenario: Childcare assistance coordination without formal program barriers\n    Given Maria cannot afford formal childcare for three children\n    And she needs flexible care support for work, emergencies, and sustainability\n    When Maria needs childcare assistance\n    Then the community_elohim should coordinate community childcare support\n    And it should connect her to subsidized programs without bureaucratic barriers\n    And it should facilitate informal care networks for flexible needs\n    And childcare support should be adequate and appropriate for her family\n    And Maria should access care help needed for solo parent survival\n\n  Scenario: School supply and activity assistance for children's participation\n    Given Maria struggles to afford school supplies, field trips, and activities\n    And she wants her children to participate fully despite budget constraints\n    When school-related expenses arise\n    Then the community_elohim should connect Maria to school assistance programs\n    And support should enable her children's full educational participation\n    And assistance should be provided without stigmatizing her family\n    And children should not be excluded from opportunities due to single-parent economics\n    And Maria should be able to provide for her children's education with community support\n\n  Scenario: Community advocacy elevates single parent issues to policy level\n    Given single parents face systemic barriers and lack political visibility\n    And policy changes could dramatically improve their circumstances\n    When Maria participates in community advocacy\n    Then the community_elohim should amplify single parent voices\n    And it should provide care economy data showing scale of solo parent contributions\n    And it should help Maria advocate for single-parent-friendly policies\n    And community should recognize single parents as care economy heroes, not broken families\n    And advocacy should push for systemic changes in housing, childcare, wages, and support\n\n  Scenario: Preventing single parent burnout through community monitoring\n    Given Maria operates at unsustainable intensity with no co-parent relief\n    And burnout is extremely common among solo parents\n    When the community_elohim monitors Maria's well-being\n    Then it should detect warning signs of approaching burnout\n    And it should proactively offer respite care and support\n    And it should coordinate community intervention before crisis occurs\n    And burnout prevention should be community responsibility\n    And Maria should have community safety net watching for her well-being\n\n  Scenario: Community resource directory tailored to single parent needs\n    Given Maria needs to know about available resources but has no time to research\n    And single parents have specific resource needs different from partnered families\n    When Maria seeks community resources\n    Then the community_elohim should provide tailored resource directory\n    And it should highlight programs specifically supporting single parents\n    And it should filter for her family size, income level, and location\n    And resource discovery should be efficient, not an exhausting research project\n    And Maria should easily find help available to her without extensive searching\n\n  Scenario: Skill-building and education support for economic advancement\n    Given Maria is stuck in low-wage medical assistant work\n    And she wants to advance economically but has no time or resources for education\n    When Maria seeks opportunities for economic advancement\n    Then the community_elohim should connect her to education and training programs\n    And it should identify programs compatible with single parent constraints\n    And it should help her access support for education costs and childcare during training\n    And skill-building should be realistic pathway to better wages\n    And Maria should have community support for economic mobility despite solo parent limitations\n\n  Scenario: Single parent household recognized in community leadership\n    Given Maria's care contributions are extraordinary\n    And she deserves voice in community governance despite time constraints\n    When community leadership positions are filled\n    Then Maria's quantified care work should be visible qualification\n    And her solo parenting should be recognized as demonstrated community commitment\n    And community should make leadership accessible to time-constrained parents\n    And single parents should have governance voice proportionate to care contributions\n    And Maria should be valued as community leader, not marginalized as struggling victim\n\n  Scenario: Community challenges single-parent stigma through visibility\n    Given society often views single-parent families as deficient or problematic\n    And this stigma harms Maria and her children\n    When community care economy makes single parents' work visible\n    Then it should demonstrate that solo parents provide extraordinary care value\n    And it should challenge deficit narratives about single-parent families\n    And it should reframe single parents as care economy heroes deserving support\n    And community should actively combat stigma through recognition and respect\n    And Maria should experience community validation, not judgment\n\n  Scenario: Community privacy protects Maria's dignity while enabling support\n    Given Maria needs community support but also privacy protection\n    And some aspects of her situation are sensitive and personal\n    When Maria participates in community care economy\n    Then the community_elohim should only share what Maria consents to\n    And her household details should remain private unless she chooses to disclose\n    And support access should not require invasive disclosure\n    And privacy should be protected even while receiving community assistance\n    And Maria should maintain dignity and control over personal information\n",
