  "content": "Scenario: Coordinating household operations while navigating legal system\n    Given I have family court hearings, protective order renewals, and legal appointments\n    And household operations must continue despite legal demands\n    When I manage competing priorities of legal navigation and household needs\n    Then the Value Scanner coordinates across both domains\n    And ensures children's needs don't fall through cracks during legal crisis\n    And tracks legal deadlines without letting household management suffer\n    And helps me prepare for legal events while maintaining household stability\n    And my personal_agent balances urgent legal tasks with ongoing household care\n    And surfaces support for children during particularly stressful legal periods\n    And recognizes that managing both is extraordinary organizational labor\n    And prevents either domain from overwhelming the other\n",
