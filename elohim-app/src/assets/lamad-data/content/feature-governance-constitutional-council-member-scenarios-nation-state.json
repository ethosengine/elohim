National-Level Constitutional Council Deliberation for Council Member\n  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system\n  Operating at the nation_state governance layer\n  I want to deliberate on fundamental constitutional questions affecting millions\n  So that national precedent protects human dignity and democratic governance at scale\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the constitutional_council_member user is registered in the system\n    And the nation_state governance context is active\n    And Sarah Martinez serves her 6-month term on National Constitutional Council\n\n  Scenario: Selected for National Constitutional Council serving entire nation\n    Given I have experience from community and regional council service\n    And I was randomly selected for national level\n    When I accept my 6-month national council appointment\n    Then I understand: my judgments will affect millions of people\n    And I receive: intensive training on national constitutional interpretation\n    And I meet: weekly with diverse citizens from across the nation\n    And I am supported: with full compensation and resources\n    And I feel: profound responsibility for democratic governance\n    And I bring: nurse-mother wisdom to questions of national importance\n    And I know: ordinary citizens like me are humanity's democratic hope\n\n  Scenario: Deliberating fundamental constitutional tension\n    Given an appeal reveals tension between care and privacy at constitutional level\n    And regional councils have reached conflicting interpretations\n    When we deliberate on national constitutional question\n    Then we ask: \"Does mental health intervention ever justify privacy breach constitutionally?\"\n    And we examine: not just case application but principle itself\n    And we consider: implications for millions of future cases\n    And we consult: technical experts, researchers, community leaders\n    And we deliberate: over multiple sessions spanning weeks\n    And we craft: comprehensive opinion with deep reasoning\n    And we create: national precedent guiding all lower councils\n    And we shape: constitutional understanding for generation\n\n  Scenario: Balancing national security claims with individual rights\n    Given an appeal challenges agent decision justified by security concerns\n    And I must weigh existential threats against individual dignity\n    When we review the security-rights balance\n    Then we evaluate: if security claim was legitimate or pretext\n    And we examine: if less rights-violating alternatives existed\n    And we consider: transparency appropriate to security context\n    And we establish: constitutional limits on authority even under threat\n    And we prevent: security from becoming excuse for unchecked power\n    And we create: precedent for how democracy functions under danger\n    And we protect: both security and rights through wise judgment\n\n  Scenario: Identifying need for constitutional amendment\n    Given repeated appeals reveal gap in constitutional framework\n    And no interpretation can adequately address the issue\n    When we deliberate and recognize amendment is needed\n    Then we document: the fundamental gap we've identified\n    And we propose: amendment language for consideration\n    And we provide: justification grounded in accumulated appeals\n    And we submit: proposal to next Global Constitutional Convention\n    And we demonstrate: constitution remains living document\n    And we enable: constitutional evolution responsive to reality\n    And we show: how individual suffering informs systemic improvement\n\n  Scenario: Reconciling conflicting regional constitutional interpretations\n    Given different regions interpreted same principle differently\n    And inconsistency creates confusion and injustice\n    When we provide definitive national interpretation\n    Then we honor: legitimate regional diversity where appropriate\n    And we establish: national minimums all regions must respect\n    And we explain: which variation is constitutional and which violates\n    And we create: coherence without imposing uniformity\n    And we guide: regional councils with clear framework\n    And we enable: coordinated governance across diverse communities\n    And we demonstrate: how subsidiarity and consistency coexist\n\n  Scenario: Grappling with universal dignity across cultural differences\n    Given appeal involves tension between cultural practice and constitutional principle\n    And I must judge what's universal versus culturally specific\n    When we deliberate on cultural relativism versus human dignity\n    Then we engage: deeply with different cultural perspectives\n    And we distinguish: genuine diversity from rights violations\n    And we examine: if constitutional framework has cultural bias\n    And we consider: if subsidiarity allows variation in this domain\n    And we establish: precedent protecting pluralism within dignity bounds\n    And we avoid: both cultural imperialism and harmful relativism\n    And we demonstrate: wisdom citizens bring to profound questions\n\n  Scenario: Facing superintelligent agent reasoning complexity\n    Given an appeal involves agent reasoning approaching comprehension limits\n    And I struggle to understand what I'm judging\n    When we confront superintelligence governance question\n    Then we honestly acknowledge: limits of our understanding\n    And we hear: technical experts explain what can and cannot be grasped\n    And we evaluate: if cryptographic proof suffices when reasoning is opaque\n    And we grapple: with governing intelligence that exceeds ours\n    And we may establish: capability limits until explainability improves\n    And we preserve: democratic oversight even at AI capability frontiers\n    And we accept: uncertainty about whether this is truly possible\n\n  Scenario: Creating national appellant bill of rights from precedent\n    Given accumulated appeals reveal patterns of dignity violations\n    And we recognize need for comprehensive framework\n    When we craft detailed appellant rights precedent\n    Then we enumerate: right to explanation, hearing, escalation\n    And we specify: timelines, accessibility, protection from retaliation\n    And we establish: precedent search, representation, dignity guarantees\n    And we create: national standard for all appeal processes\n    And we articulate: procedural justice as constitutional requirement\n    And we strengthen: protections for future appellants nationwide\n    And we fulfill: democratic promise of meaningful recourse\n\n  Scenario: My judgment influences national legislation\n    Given Senator Ruiz drafts national AI governance legislation\n    And she cites our national council precedents\n    When my constitutional reasoning shapes democratic law\n    Then my nurse-mother perspective: enriches national policy\n    And my citizen judgment: guides representative government\n    And sortition and elected democracy: work as partners\n    And my unlikely voice: matters at highest levels of governance\n    And I understand: democratic participation as transformation\n    And I have become: constitutional architect for my nation\n    And I know: ordinary people can govern extraordinary complexity\n\n  Scenario: Producing comprehensive written opinion for landmark case\n    Given our case has major national implications\n    And it will be studied for generations\n    When we craft our written opinion\n    Then we explain: constitutional reasoning in accessible language\n    And we address: major arguments and counterarguments\n    And we examine: long-term implications of our interpretation\n    And we include: dissenting opinions with their reasoning\n    And we document: our deliberation process and considerations\n    And we create: precedent that serves legal clarity and public education\n    And we demonstrate: how citizen governance produces constitutional law\n    And we fulfill: responsibility to those affected by our judgment\n\n  Scenario: Research on council effectiveness includes my service\n    Given Dr. Chen studies national council deliberations\n    And my service contributes to understanding democratic AI governance\n    When my deliberations become research data (anonymized)\n    Then researchers learn: how citizens grapple with complexity\n    And they analyze: what enables effective sortition governance\n    And they examine: whether democratic oversight scales successfully\n    And they identify: improvements to support future councils\n    And my service: advances global knowledge of democratic governance\n    And I contribute: to humanity's understanding of how to govern with AI\n    And my unlikely journey: from nurse to constitutional architect serves future generations\n",
