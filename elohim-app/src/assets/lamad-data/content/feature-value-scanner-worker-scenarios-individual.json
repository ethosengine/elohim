  "content": "Feature: Individual Worker Self-Care and Autonomy\n  As a worker balancing employment and care needs\n  I need to maintain individual autonomy and self-care despite work demands\n  So that I can preserve my dignity, health, and capacity for human flourishing\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am a worker with irregular employment schedule\n    And I have limited time and energy for self-care\n    And my personal_agent monitors my well-being\n    And the protocol recognizes my care work as valuable\n\n  Scenario: Managing self-care with unpredictable work schedule\n    Given my work schedule changes weekly with different shift patterns\n    And I need to maintain basic nutrition and rest\n    When my personal_agent detects schedule changes\n    Then it should adapt my meal planning to available time slots\n    And suggest efficient meal prep strategies for my schedule\n    And protect time blocks for essential self-care\n    And remind me that my well-being matters despite work demands\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing my own labor as care contribution\n    Given I work 50+ hours per week as a line cook\n    And I prepare food for hundreds of people daily\n    When I view my work through the care economy lens\n    Then the protocol should recognize my labor as care work\n    And accumulate care tokens reflecting my contribution to community nourishment\n    And show me that my work has dignity and social value\n    And reframe my relationship to labor from pure exploitation to meaningful contribution\n\n  Scenario: Tracking self-care achievements despite exhaustion\n    Given I am exhausted after double shifts\n    And self-care feels impossible\n    When I manage to cook a nutritious meal for myself\n    Or maintain my living space\n    Or get adequate sleep\n    Then the protocol should recognize these achievements\n    And validate that caring for myself is valuable work\n    And celebrate small victories in maintaining well-being\n    And build evidence that I deserve conditions that make self-care possible\n\n  Scenario: Detecting when work demands destroy self-care capacity\n    Given my personal_agent monitors my nutrition and rest patterns\n    When my meal quality decreases for multiple consecutive days\n    And my sleep falls below healthy minimums\n    And I show signs of chronic exhaustion\n    Then the protocol should surface a crisis alert\n    And provide resources for immediate support\n    And suggest workplace advocacy options\n    And connect me to community care resources\n\n  Scenario: Managing tight budget for individual needs\n    Given I earn $32k/year and have $60/week food budget\n    And I need to maximize nutritional value per dollar\n    When I plan my grocery shopping\n    Then the protocol should provide sophisticated budget optimization\n    And suggest high-value nutritious ingredients\n    And identify sales and discounts at accessible stores\n    And help me stretch limited resources without sacrificing health\n\n  Scenario: Protecting individual autonomy under employment pressure\n    Given my employer demands maximum flexibility\n    And employment pressure threatens my autonomy\n    When I need to maintain boundaries for self-care\n    Then my personal_agent should help me recognize when boundaries are violated\n    And support me in protecting essential personal time\n    And remind me that I have rights beyond being a labor unit\n    And provide language for asserting my needs\n\n  Scenario: Meal prepping efficiently with limited energy\n    Given I have only 2 hours between shifts to prepare meals\n    And I am already exhausted from work\n    When I need to prep food for the next several days\n    Then the protocol should suggest maximum-efficiency meal prep strategies\n    And provide step-by-step guidance requiring minimal cognitive load\n    And optimize for nutritional value, cost, and preparation time\n    And recognize this household labor as valuable care work\n\n  Scenario: Building individual resilience through care work visibility\n    Given the protocol tracks all my care contributions\n    Including my paid labor and household self-care\n    When I review my care economy participation\n    Then I should see comprehensive evidence of my contributions\n    And understand that I am providing valuable service to community\n    And recognize that I deserve better compensation and conditions\n    And feel empowered to advocate for my needs\n\n  Scenario: Accessing individual health monitoring\n    Given work conditions threaten my physical and mental health\n    When my personal_agent detects warning signs\n    Such as declining nutrition, inadequate rest, or chronic stress\n    Then it should provide gentle health monitoring\n    And surface accessible healthcare resources\n    And help me understand my rights to workplace accommodations\n    And support me in prioritizing my health despite work pressure\n\n  Scenario: Planning personal development despite time constraints\n    Given I have skills and interests beyond my current job\n    And employment leaves minimal time for personal development\n    When I want to learn new skills or pursue interests\n    Then the protocol should help me find micro-opportunities\n    And connect me to accessible learning resources\n    And recognize that my growth and flourishing matter\n    And support me in maintaining identity beyond worker role\n\n  Scenario: Documenting personal needs for advocacy\n    Given I experience specific challenges due to work conditions\n    When I want to advocate for changes\n    Then the protocol should help me document my needs\n    And provide evidence of how current conditions affect my well-being\n    And support me in articulating what I need to thrive\n    And empower me to advocate for care-economy-aligned workplace policies\n",
