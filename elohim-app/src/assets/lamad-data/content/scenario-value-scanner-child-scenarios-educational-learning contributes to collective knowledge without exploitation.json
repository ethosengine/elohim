  "content": "Scenario: Learning contributes to collective knowledge without exploitation\n    Given Emma's learning patterns generate educational data\n    And this data could improve pedagogy for other children\n    When Emma's anonymized learning data is collected\n    Then it must only be used to improve educational outcomes\n    And Emma's privacy must be absolutely protected\n    And no commercial exploitation should occur\n    And data should serve collective learning, not surveillance capitalism\n    And educational data must never be monetized\n    And community benefit must not compromise individual privacy\n",
