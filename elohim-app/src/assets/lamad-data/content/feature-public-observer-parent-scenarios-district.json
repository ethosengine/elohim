School District Parent Advocacy\n  As a parent in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the district governance layer\n  I want to influence district decisions affecting my children's education\n  So that resource allocation and policies serve student wellbeing not bureaucratic convenience\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the parent user is registered in the system\n    And the parent has linked their children's schools and grade levels\n    And the district governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Parent decodes district resource allocation decisions\n    Given the school board discusses \"optimizing resource distribution\"\n    And the parent cannot attend the 3-hour Tuesday evening meeting\n    When the parent reviews Observer's translated summary\n    Then they learn this means cutting 12 teaching positions\n    And see this increases their child's class size from 24 to 32 students\n    And understand real impact on their child's learning\n    And can submit informed opposition via app in 10 minutes\n    And bureaucratic language doesn't hide impacts from working parents\n\n  Scenario: Parent exposes systematic school funding inequities\n    Given the parent's child attends an eastside elementary school\n    And suspects their school gets fewer resources than westside schools\n    When the parent reviews Observer's district funding analysis\n    Then they see westside schools spend $2,400 more per student\n    And westside schools have experienced teachers and enrichment programs\n    And eastside schools have newer teachers and cut arts programs\n    And pattern of inequity becomes documented and undeniable\n    And parent advocacy shifts from suspicion to evidence-based demands\n\n  Scenario: Parent challenges school boundary changes\n    Given the district proposes \"boundary realignment for efficiency\"\n    And the parent's child would be moved to a different school\n    When the parent reviews Observer's impact analysis\n    Then they see which neighborhoods are most affected\n    And understand this separates siblings between different schools\n    And view maps showing longer commutes for certain families\n    And connect with other parents facing same disruption\n    And coordinate testimony about family impacts at boundary hearing\n\n  Scenario: Parent tracks school board promises over time\n    Given the school board promised to \"address transportation issues by Q2\"\n    And the parent's child still has unreliable bus service three months later\n    When the parent checks Observer's commitment tracking\n    Then they see the exact promise made in the February meeting\n    And view that no action has been taken despite deadline passing\n    And can raise specific accountability question at next meeting\n    And institutional memory persists beyond administrator turnover\n    And board commitments to parents aren't forgotten when attention shifts\n\n  Scenario: Parent discovers teacher coalition opposing same policy\n    Given the district proposes eliminating planning periods for teachers\n    And the parent sees this will harm their child's education quality\n    When the Observer shows teacher union concerns about the policy\n    Then the parent understands teachers oppose it for same reasons\n    And natural parent-teacher alliance becomes visible\n    And parent and teacher testimonies reinforce each other\n    And coordinated advocacy prevents divide-and-conquer tactics\n    And district can't pit parents against teachers\n\n  Scenario: Parent evaluates school board candidates\n    Given three candidates are running for school board seats\n    And the parent has limited time to research before the election\n    When the parent reviews Observer's candidate analysis\n    Then they see each candidate's voting record on key issues\n    And view candidates' positions on class sizes and program funding\n    And understand which candidates prioritize student needs vs politics\n    And can make informed voting decision in 15 minutes\n    And democracy extends to education governance elections\n\n  Scenario: Parent coordinates district-wide program cut opposition\n    Given the district plans to eliminate music programs to save money\n    And the parent's child participates in the school band\n    When the Observer connects parents across all affected schools\n    Then 230 parents from 8 schools join coordinated advocacy\n    And coalition presents unified data on music program benefits\n    And shows alternative cost-saving options that preserve programs\n    And district-wide parent power prevents divide-and-conquer\n    And music programs are preserved through collective action\n\n  Scenario: Parent challenges special education service cuts\n    Given the parent's child receives special education services\n    And the district proposes reducing support staff \"for efficiency\"\n    When the parent reviews Observer's analysis of legal requirements\n    Then they understand federal law mandates these services\n    And see which services would be cut and impacts on IEPs\n    And connect with other special education parents\n    And can cite specific legal protections in testimony\n    And district cannot quietly violate disability rights without accountability\n\n  Scenario: Parent tracks implementation of new safety policies\n    Given the school board passed new student safety protocols\n    And promised implementation at all schools by September\n    When September arrives and the parent's school lacks the protocols\n    Then the Observer alerts parent about implementation failure\n    And shows which schools have implemented vs which haven't\n    And reveals pattern of under-resourced schools being deprioritized\n    And parent can demand accountability for child safety commitments\n    And policy passage doesn't mean policy implementation without tracking\n",
