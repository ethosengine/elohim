Educational Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent\n  As a single parent interfacing with educational systems\n  Operating at the educational governance layer\n  I want schools to recognize and accommodate single-parent family realities\n  So that my children receive full educational support despite our family structure\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the single parent user \"Maria\" is registered in the system\n    And Maria's three children attend different schools/grades (ages 6, 9, and 14)\n    And Maria manages all school engagement alone with no co-parent support\n    And she works full-time with limited flexibility\n    And the educational governance context is active\n    And the educational_elohim coordinates school-family interactions\n    And Maria interfaces with elementary, middle, and early high school systems\n\n  Scenario: Schools recognize single-parent families in forms and communications\n    Given school forms typically ask for \"mother and father\" information\n    And communications assume two-parent household availability\n    When schools collect family information\n    Then the educational_elohim should advocate for single-parent-inclusive forms\n    And forms should acknowledge diverse family structures respectfully\n    And communications should not assume two parents are available\n    And schools should recognize single parents manage everything alone\n    And Maria should not have to repeatedly explain or defend her family structure\n\n  Scenario: Parent-teacher conferences scheduled for working single parent availability\n    Given Maria must attend conferences for three children across different schools\n    And she has no co-parent to split attendance or attend in her place\n    When schools schedule parent-teacher conferences\n    Then the educational_elohim should coordinate scheduling across multiple schools\n    And schools should offer evening or flexible timing for working single parents\n    And Maria should not have to take multiple work days for conferences\n    And scheduling should recognize single parents cannot \"send the other parent\"\n    And educational engagement should be accessible to working solo parents\n\n  Scenario: School events and volunteer expectations account for single parent constraints\n    Given schools often expect parent participation in events and volunteering\n    And Maria has severe time and energy constraints as solo working parent\n    When schools set participation expectations\n    Then the educational_elohim should make visible single parents' realistic capacity\n    And schools should not penalize children whose single parents cannot volunteer extensively\n    And limited participation should not reflect on children's family or parent's commitment\n    And schools should recognize some parents are managing heroically just to survive\n    And Maria's children should not suffer because she cannot match two-parent family participation\n\n  Scenario: Emergency contact procedures recognize single parents have no immediate backup\n    Given Maria is the only parent available for children's emergencies\n    And she may be unreachable due to work constraints\n    When schools need emergency parent contact\n    Then the educational_elohim should help Maria establish backup emergency contacts\n    And schools should understand single parents may not be immediately available\n    And emergency protocols should include extended family or neighbor backups\n    And schools should work with Maria's realistic availability constraints\n    And children's emergency needs should be met even when solo parent is unavailable\n\n  Scenario: Homework support expectations realistic for single parent households\n    Given Maria manages homework support for three children across different grade levels\n    And she does this after full workday while managing dinner, household, and bedtime\n    When schools assign homework requiring parent support\n    Then the educational_elohim should advocate for realistic homework expectations\n    And assignments should not assume extensive parent availability or expertise\n    And schools should recognize single parents have limited capacity to support homework\n    And children should not be penalized for single parent's time constraints\n    And homework policies should account for diverse family circumstances\n\n  Scenario: School fee and activity cost assistance for single-income families\n    Given Maria's single income must support household of four\n    And she struggles to afford school fees, field trips, sports, and activities\n    When schools require fees or activity payments\n    Then the educational_elohim should connect Maria to fee assistance programs\n    And schools should provide cost support without stigmatizing single-parent families\n    And all children should access educational opportunities regardless of single-parent economics\n    And fee assistance should be available and accessible\n    And Maria's children should participate fully without financial exclusion\n\n  Scenario: Before and after school care affordable and accessible for working single parents\n    Given Maria works 8-5 while school runs roughly 8-3\n    And she cannot afford $400+/month per child for extended care across three children\n    When Maria needs childcare for school schedule gaps\n    Then the educational_elohim should help her access affordable before/after school care\n    And schools should provide cost-effective extended care options\n    And subsidies should be available for single-income families\n    And care should cover the full gap between school and work hours\n    And Maria should be able to maintain employment through affordable school-based care\n\n  Scenario: Single parent representation in school governance and decision-making\n    Given single parents have specific needs and perspectives\n    And they are often underrepresented in school governance due to time constraints\n    When schools form parent councils or governance bodies\n    Then the educational_elohim should facilitate single parent participation\n    And schools should make governance accessible to time-constrained parents\n    And single parent voices should inform school policies\n    And Maria should be able to contribute to school governance despite constraints\n    And educational policy should reflect single-parent family realities\n\n  Scenario: Teacher understanding of single-parent household stress on children\n    Given children in single-parent families may experience unique stressors\n    And teachers should understand these realities without stigmatizing\n    When teachers work with Maria's children\n    Then the educational_elohim should help educators understand single-parent contexts\n    And teachers should recognize potential impacts on children without deficit framing\n    And children should receive appropriate support without being labeled as \"at-risk\" due to family structure\n    And schools should support thriving despite different family structures\n    And Maria's children should be seen as individuals, not stereotyped by single-parent status\n\n  Scenario: Communication methods accommodate working single parent schedule\n    Given Maria cannot answer phone calls during work hours\n    And she manages communications for three children across different schools\n    When schools communicate with parents\n    Then the educational_elohim should coordinate school communications efficiently\n    And schools should use methods accessible to working parents (email, portal, evening calls)\n    And Maria should not miss critical information due to daytime-only communication\n    And communication should be consolidated and efficient for time-constrained parents\n    And schools should respect that single working parents have limited availability\n\n  Scenario: Special education or support service coordination across siblings\n    Given one or more of Maria's children may need educational support services\n    And she must coordinate any special needs alone across multiple children\n    When children require special education services or support\n    Then the educational_elohim should help Maria coordinate across children and schools\n    And schools should recognize she's managing support needs without co-parent\n    And scheduling of meetings and services should accommodate her work constraints\n    And single parents should receive extra support for complex special education navigation\n    And Maria should be able to advocate effectively for children's needs despite time limitations\n\n  Scenario: Schools challenge single-parent deficit narratives through care economy data\n    Given society often views single-parent families as inherently problematic\n    And this stigma affects how teachers and administrators view Maria's children\n    When schools engage with single-parent families\n    Then the educational_elohim should provide care economy data showing single parents' contributions\n    And schools should recognize single parents as providing extraordinary care\n    And deficit narratives about single-parent families should be challenged with evidence\n    And Maria and her children should be treated with respect, not pity\n    And educational systems should support single-parent family thriving, not assume deficiency\n\n  Scenario: Parent involvement recognition values Maria's solo engagement\n    Given Maria manages all school engagement for three children alone\n    And partnered parents split involvement between two people\n    When schools recognize parent involvement\n    Then the educational_elohim should quantify Maria's engagement across all three children\n    And her solo involvement should be recognized as extraordinary effort\n    And schools should value her participation even if she cannot match two-parent family availability\n    And parent involvement metrics should account for family structure differences\n    And Maria should receive appropriate recognition for managing everything alone\n",
