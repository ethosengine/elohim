  "content": "Scenario: Establishing liability framework for agent errors\n    Given agents will make mistakes\n    And someone must address harms\n    When I create liability and accountability legislation\n    Then I establish: protocol insurance pool for errors\n    And I specify: remedies for different types of mistakes\n    And I require: immediate correction and compensation\n    And I penalize: bad-faith attempts to corrupt agents\n    And I balance: accountability with innovation\n    And framework: enables learning from mistakes\n    And responsibility: is clear without stifling development\n",
