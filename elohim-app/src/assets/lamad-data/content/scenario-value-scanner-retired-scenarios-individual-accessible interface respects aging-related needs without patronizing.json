  "content": "Scenario: Accessible interface respects aging-related needs without patronizing\n    Given Frank is experiencing some age-related vision changes\n    And he may have reduced dexterity for small touch targets\n    When Frank uses the Value Scanner interface\n    Then the interface should display large, high-contrast fonts\n    And touch targets should be large and forgiving\n    And voice interface options should be available\n    And navigation should be simple and consistent\n    And no time-limited interactions should be required\n    And the design should be accessible without feeling condescending\n    And Frank should experience the interface as respectful and empowering\n    And cognitive load should be minimized\n",
