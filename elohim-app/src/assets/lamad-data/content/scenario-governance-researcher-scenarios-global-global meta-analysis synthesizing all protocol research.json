  "content": "Scenario: Global meta-analysis synthesizing all protocol research\n    Given hundreds of researchers have studied protocol worldwide\n    And I want to synthesize cumulative knowledge\n    When I conduct systematic review and meta-analysis\n    Then I identify: all rigorous studies meeting quality criteria\n    And I synthesize: findings across diverse contexts and methods\n    And I assess: overall evidence about effectiveness and limitations\n    And I examine: publication bias and selective reporting\n    And I identify: gaps in knowledge requiring further research\n    And I provide: comprehensive evidence base for global policy\n    And My meta-analysis serves: evidence-based democratic deliberation at planetary scale\n",
