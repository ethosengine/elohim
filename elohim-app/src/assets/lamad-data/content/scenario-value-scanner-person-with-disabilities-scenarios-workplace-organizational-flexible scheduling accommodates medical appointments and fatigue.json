  "content": "Scenario: Flexible scheduling accommodates medical appointments and fatigue\n    Given Alex has medical appointments and disability-related health needs\n    And fatigue is a real factor in Alex's work capacity\n    When Alex manages work schedule\n    Then the workplace_elohim should help negotiate flexible scheduling\n    And it should track accommodation requests for schedule flexibility\n    And Alex should be able to adjust hours around medical needs\n    And part-time status should be respected as appropriate for Alex's capacity\n    And the protocol should support Alex in managing work-life balance\n    And flexible scheduling should be framed as reasonable accommodation\n    And Alex's productivity should be measured appropriately for part-time work\n",
