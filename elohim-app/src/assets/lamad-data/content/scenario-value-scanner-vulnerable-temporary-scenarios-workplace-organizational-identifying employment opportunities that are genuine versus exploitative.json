  "content": "Scenario: Identifying employment opportunities that are genuine versus exploitative\n    Given some employers specifically target vulnerable people for exploitation\n    And I am vulnerable to accepting exploitative work due to desperation\n    When I evaluate employment opportunities\n    Then the workplace_elohim helps me assess whether opportunities are exploitative\n    And identifies red flags (unpaid \"training\", illegal pay practices, unsafe conditions, unrealistic expectations)\n    And validates that I deserve fair employment, not exploitation\n    And helps me decline opportunities that would harm my recovery\n    And surfaces genuinely fair employment options\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to concerning employer patterns\n    And recognizes that protecting myself from exploitation is essential\n    And supports me waiting for appropriate opportunity rather than accepting harm\n",
