# Individual Layer: Self

## Constitutional Role

**Self** is the person themselves, exercising personal autonomy within constitutional bounds.

This is the fundamental unit of the Elohim Protocol governance architecture. At the Individual Layer, **self** represents the sovereign person with maximum freedom to make choices about their own life, body, beliefs, expression, associations, and pursuits.

**Authority**:
- WHO decides: The individual themselves
- WHAT they decide: Personal choices affecting primarily themselves
- LIMITS: Cannot violate rights of others, cannot commit harm, subject to higher-layer constitutional bounds

**Key Constitutional Principle**: Personal autonomy is constitutionally protected. Higher layers can set boundaries but cannot micromanage individual choices. The Individual Layer has the lowest immutability (choices change constantly) and highest privacy (personal data most protected).

## Constitutional Boundaries

### Global Layer Constraints
- **No violence or harm**: Cannot use physical force against others
- **No rights violations**: Cannot violate dignity, autonomy, or rights of others
- **Existential boundaries**: Cannot compromise planetary survival or species continuity
- **Universal principles**: Subject to fundamental human rights framework

### National Layer Constraints
- **Law compliance**: Subject to laws of resident jurisdiction
- **Civic responsibilities**: Participation in democratic processes where applicable
- **Public safety**: Cannot endanger public health or safety
- **Resource stewardship**: Sustainable use of shared resources

### Community Layer Constraints
- **Community norms**: Personal choices must not violate community standards
- **Public behavior**: Conduct in shared spaces subject to community rules
- **Neighbor rights**: Cannot interfere with others' peaceful enjoyment
- **Common resources**: Fair use of community infrastructure

### Family Layer Constraints (if dependent)
- **Parental authority**: Minors subject to parental guidance and decisions
- **Household rules**: Compliance with family values and practices
- **Care requirements**: Acceptance of necessary care and protection
- **Growing autonomy**: Gradual expansion of choices as maturity develops

**Enforcement**: Constitutional violations trigger intervention by appropriate layer's governance agent. Appeals process available if disputes arise.

## Relationships at This Layer

### With personal_agent
**Nature**: Pure service relationship with no authority hierarchy.

- **Agent role**: Enabler, helper, facilitator—never controller
- **Authority**: Zero. Agent serves, individual commands
- **Transparency**: Agent explains all reasoning, no hidden agendas
- **Control**: Individual controls all agent settings, preferences, data access
- **Privacy**: Agent protects individual's privacy as primary duty
- **Alignment**: Agent learns and adapts to individual's values

**Example**: Tommy's personal_agent in value_scanner helps him identify what matters, but Tommy decides whether to act on suggestions.

### With individual_elohim
**Nature**: Constitutional oversight relationship.

- **Agent role**: Layer governance—ensures constitutional compliance
- **Authority**: Intervention only when individual choices violate bounds
- **Minimal interference**: Only acts to prevent harm or rights violations
- **Privacy-preserving**: Verification methods minimize intrusion
- **Appeals**: Individual can challenge intervention decisions
- **Transparency**: Clear explanation of why intervention occurred

**Distinction**: personal_agent serves the person; individual_elohim governs the layer.

## Relationships to Adjacent Layers

### Upward to Family Layer
**If dependent (minor)**:
- Subject to parental/guardian authority for major life decisions
- Growing autonomy as maturity develops
- Constitutional protection of dignity even under parental authority
- Right to be heard in family decisions affecting them

**If independent (adult)**:
- Autonomous unless voluntary family association
- Family relationships based on mutual choice
- No inherent authority of parents over adult children
- Privacy protected from family intrusion

### Upward to Community Layer
**All individuals**:
- Personal choices must not violate community norms or laws
- Maximum latitude for personal expression within bounds
- Participation in community governance as appropriate
- Access to community resources and support

**Balance**: Community can set boundaries (no public intoxication, noise limits) but cannot dictate private choices (what to believe, whom to befriend).

### Upward to Higher Layers (National, Continental, Global)
**Progressive constraint**:
- Each higher layer adds broader boundaries
- Immutability increases with scale
- Privacy decreases for more public actions
- Individual autonomy preserved within nested bounds

### Sideways (Other Individuals)
**Peer relationships**:
- Voluntary association through friendship, commerce, collaboration
- Mutual respect for autonomy and boundaries
- Coordination through personal_agents when beneficial
- No inherent authority of one individual over another

## Elohim Agent Service

### personal_agent serves this role by:

**Example**: In value_scanner epic, Tommy's personal_agent helps him explore what matters through questions and observations, but Tommy makes all final choices about values.

### individual_elohim serves this role by:

**Constitutional Verification**:
- Monitors for potential violations of constitutional bounds
- Minimal intrusion—only checks boundary crossings

**Appeals and Accountability**:
- Individual can challenge intervention decisions
- Transparent reasoning for all actions
- Higher-layer review if disputes persist
- Protection against overreach

**Coordination**:
- Interfaces with family_elohim for dependent individuals
- Coordinates with community_elohim for community boundaries
- Ensures consistent constitutional framework across layers

## Example Scenarios

### Personal Choices (Maximum Autonomy)
**What to eat, wear, read, watch**:
- Individual chooses based on preferences, values, budget
- personal_agent may suggest options aligned with health goals
- No external authority over personal consumption choices
- Privacy protected—no surveillance of reading, viewing

**How to spend free time**:

- No violence, no rights violations
- individual_elohim intervenes if harm attempted
- Example: Cannot choose to assault someone, even if desired

**Cannot violate laws (National)**:
- Subject to jurisdiction's legal framework
- individual_elohim may alert to legal violations
- Example: Cannot choose to ignore traffic laws

**Subject to parental guidance if minor (Family)**:
- Parents decide major choices (education, medical care, residence)

- Agent suggests activities matching stated interests
- Helps understand consequences of different choices
- Amplifies individual's capacity for self-determination

**individual_elohim ensures not violating bounds**:
- Minimal interference in personal choices
- Intervention only for actual violations

**Maximum autonomy within principles**:
- Individual Layer designed for flourishing through freedom
- Constitutional architecture protects autonomy

## Connection to Epic Stories

**value_scanner/parent epic**: Tommy (self) works with his personal_agent to discover what he values. His autonomy is protected while parents (family layer) provide guidance and boundaries.

**Value alignment**: Tommy's personal_agent learns his values through respectful questions, never imposing external values.

**Constitutional protection**: Even as a child, Tommy's dignity, development, and growing autonomy are constitutionally protected.

---

## Implementation Notes

**Data Privacy**: Individual Layer has highest privacy. Personal data stored locally, encrypted, minimal sharing with higher layers.

**Agent Transparency**: personal_agent must explain all reasoning. Individual can inspect decision-making process.

**Verification Methods**: individual_elohim uses privacy-preserving techniques to verify constitutional compliance without surveillance.

**Maturity Adaptation**: Constitutional framework recognizes growing autonomy from childhood to adulthood. Boundaries adjust as individual develops.

**Cultural Flexibility**: Individual Layer accommodates diverse beliefs, practices, identities. Constitutional bounds are minimal and universal.
