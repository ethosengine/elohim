Feature: Community Space Moderation with Restorative Approach
  As a community_moderator in the social_medium system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to maintain healthy spaces where human flourishing is possible
  So that communities can coordinate and communicate without harm

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the community_moderator user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active
    And the moderator is Alex, serving the Riverside community

  Scenario: Moderator resolves conflict with restorative approach
    Given two community members have an escalating disagreement
    And the moderation agent alerts Alex to rising tension
    When Alex reviews the full context and conversation history
    And sees both parties have history of positive contributions
    Then Alex initiates restorative dialogue process
    And both parties can express their concerns privately
    And Alex helps them find common ground and mutual understanding
    And the conflict is resolved without punitive action
    And both parties remain active, valued community members

  Scenario: Moderator detects and prevents infiltration attempt
    Given the housing justice organizing space has active membership
    When the pattern detection agent identifies suspicious new member
    And the new member exhibits patterns of infiltrator behavior
    Then Alex receives alert with evidence of concerning patterns
    And Alex can see the member lacks community trust connections
    And Alex reviews their contribution patterns and tactics
    And Alex prevents the infiltrator from disrupting organizing
    And the space remains safe for genuine organizing work

  Scenario: Moderator protects child while educating peer
    Given a teenage member posts content inappropriate for younger children
    And the guardian agent prevents younger children from seeing it
    When Alex is notified of the age-appropriateness issue
    Then Alex reaches out to the teenager with education, not punishment
    And explains how to gauge age-appropriateness
    And the teenager learns and adjusts future contributions
    And younger children were protected without the teenager being shamed
    And restorative education prevented future issues

  Scenario: Moderator coordinates with other moderators on cross-community issue
    Given a coordinated harassment campaign targets multiple communities
    And the pattern detection agent identifies the coordinated nature
    When Alex and moderators from affected communities are alerted
    Then they can coordinate response while respecting local autonomy
    And each community handles the issue according to their standards
    And patterns are shared to protect other communities
    And the coordinated attack is neutralized through cooperation
