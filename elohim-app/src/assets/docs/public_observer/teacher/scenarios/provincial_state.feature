Feature: State Education Policy Engagement for Teacher
  As a teacher in the public_observer system
  Operating at the provincial/state governance layer
  I want to inform state education policy with classroom expertise
  So that state decisions reflect teaching and learning realities

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teacher user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active

  Scenario: Teacher tracks state education legislation affecting classroom
    Given state legislature is considering education bills
    And teachers can't track complex legislative processes while teaching
    When the Observer monitors state education legislation
    Then teachers receive alerts on bills affecting their work
    And get plain-language summaries of education policy changes
    And see projected impact on classroom teaching and learning
    And access advocacy pathways (testimony, legislator contact, coalition)
    And state policy becomes visible and actionable for frontline professionals

  Scenario: Teacher coordinates statewide advocacy against testing mandate
    Given state proposes expanding standardized testing requirements
    And testing already narrows curriculum and stresses students
    When teachers coordinate through Observer across districts statewide
    Then 3,200 teachers sign onto collective advocacy campaign
    And provide testimony on how testing burdens harm learning
    And build coalition with parents experiencing test stress
    And present evidence from states that reduced testing
    And collective professional voice creates political pressure
    And state testing policy becomes contested not inevitable

  Scenario: Teacher evaluates state education funding formula
    Given state funding formula determines district resources
    And formula appears complex and technical
    When the Observer analyzes state funding impacts
    Then teachers see their district gets $8,500 per student
    And neighboring district gets $12,000 per student from same formula
    And understand which formula factors create disparities
    And learn which legislators champion funding equity
    And coordinate with underfunded districts for reform coalition
    And education funding becomes teacher advocacy priority

  Scenario: Teacher exposes state curriculum standards implementation gap
    Given state adopted new curriculum standards three years ago
    But provided no implementation funding or professional development
    When teachers document implementation reality through Observer
    Then statewide data shows 68% of teachers lack standards-aligned materials
    And 71% received no professional development on new standards
    And student assessment results reflect implementation failure
    And teachers coordinate testimony to state education committee
    And policy implementation accountability emerges from teacher evidence

  Scenario: Teacher advocates for professional development reform
    Given state mandates professional development hours annually
    But current PD is generic and unhelpful for actual teaching
    When teachers provide evidence on PD effectiveness through Observer
    Then aggregated data shows teachers rate 80% of PD as not useful
    And teachers propose evidence-based PD reform based on what actually helps
    And document successful PD models from other states
    And coordinate with education researchers and reform advocates
    And state professional development policy respects teacher expertise

  Scenario: Teacher challenges state teacher evaluation mandate
    Given state law requires evaluation system based on student test scores
    And teachers know this creates perverse incentives and doesn't improve teaching
    When teachers organize statewide campaign through Observer
    Then teachers provide evidence on evaluation system failures
    And show how it drives teaching to test not student learning
    And present research on effective teacher evaluation approaches
    And build parent coalition around learning-centered not test-centered education
    And state evaluation policy becomes political accountability issue

  Scenario: Teacher connects state policy to classroom impacts
    Given state cut education budget by $400M this year
    And politicians claim "no impact on classroom instruction"
    When teachers document actual classroom impacts through Observer
    Then statewide data shows 1,200 teaching positions eliminated
    And class sizes increased average 3 students per class
    And art/music/counseling programs cut in 40% of districts
    And teachers connect budget abstraction to learning reality
    And teacher evidence exposes political rhetoric vs classroom truth
