Feature: Teacher Working Conditions and Labor Rights for Teacher
  As a teacher in the public_observer system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer
  I want transparency and advocacy power for working conditions
  So that teaching becomes sustainable and professionally respected work

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teacher user is registered in the system
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active

  Scenario: Teacher documents unpaid overtime and workload
    Given teachers work far beyond contracted hours
    And administration claims workload is reasonable
    When teachers track actual working hours through Observer
    Then aggregated data shows teachers average 52 hours weekly vs 40 contracted
    And 12 hours weekly of unpaid overtime is documented
    And workload breakdown reveals what consumes time (grading, paperwork, meetings)
    And union uses evidence in contract negotiations for compensation or reduction
    And working conditions transparency creates accountability pressure

  Scenario: Teacher exposes planning time inequities across schools
    Given some schools provide adequate planning time while others don't
    And teachers don't know if their conditions are typical or problematic
    When the Observer documents planning time across district
    Then teachers see stark disparities (30 min vs 90 min daily planning)
    And identify which principals prioritize teacher planning time
    And understand patterns (wealthy schools get more planning time)
    And coordinate advocacy for district-wide planning time standards
    And working conditions comparison drives equity

  Scenario: Teacher advocates for mental health and wellness support
    Given teaching is emotionally demanding work with high burnout
    And district provides minimal employee mental health support
    When teachers document wellness needs and impacts through Observer
    Then data shows 68% of teachers experience burnout symptoms
    And 82% say job stress affects personal life and health
    And teachers identify needed supports (counseling, reasonable workload, respect)
    And union negotiates wellness provisions in contract
    And teacher wellbeing becomes labor rights priority

  Scenario: Teacher challenges administrator retaliation safely
    Given a principal retaliates against teachers who question decisions
    And individual teachers fear speaking up
    When teachers report concerns anonymously through Observer
    Then patterns of retaliation become visible (negative evaluations after dissent)
    And aggregated evidence protects individual teachers
    And union files grievance based on documented pattern
    And district addresses hostile administrator behavior
    And anonymous reporting enables accountability without individual risk

  Scenario: Teacher compares compensation across districts
    Given teacher salaries vary significantly across nearby districts
    And teachers lack comparative compensation information
    When the Observer analyzes teacher compensation regionally
    Then teachers see their district pays $8,000 below regional average
    And understand total compensation including benefits and workload
    And learn which districts have better contracts and why
    And use evidence in contract negotiations and recruitment crisis advocacy
    And compensation transparency drives labor market awareness

  Scenario: Teacher documents personal spending on classroom supplies
    Given teachers spend personal money on student supplies
    And administration doesn't acknowledge this burden
    When teachers track personal spending through Observer
    Then district-wide data shows teachers spend average $600 annually
    And spending patterns reveal systematic resource inadequacy
    And teachers document impact on lower-income teachers
    And advocate for adequate classroom budgets as equity issue
    And working conditions transparency exposes hidden subsidies teachers provide

  Scenario: Teacher advocates for professional development that actually helps
    Given district mandates professional development hours
    But most PD is generic and doesn't improve teaching
    When teachers evaluate professional development through Observer
    Then teachers rate 75% of required PD as not useful for their teaching
    And identify what actually helps (job-embedded coaching, subject-specific content)
    And document time wasted on compliance PD vs productive professional learning
    And negotiate for teacher voice in PD planning and evaluation
    And professional development becomes professional not bureaucratic

  Scenario: Teacher tracks contract implementation and enforcement
    Given union contract includes working condition provisions
    But contract enforcement is inconsistent across schools
    When the Observer monitors contract implementation
    Then teachers document where contract is violated (planning time, class sizes, duties)
    And patterns show which administrators ignore contract provisions
    And union identifies systemic enforcement gaps vs isolated violations
    And brings accountability data to district and grievance process
    And contract becomes enforceable through transparency

  Scenario: Teacher builds solidarity across educator roles
    Given teachers, paraprofessionals, and support staff share labor interests
    But often lack coordination and mutual understanding
    When the Observer facilitates cross-role working conditions analysis
    Then educators see shared challenges (understaffing, disrespect, inadequate pay)
    And identify how working conditions affect student support
    And build coalition across educator roles for contract negotiations
    And solidarity emerges from shared evidence and common interests
    And labor advocacy becomes comprehensive not siloed

  Scenario: Teacher connects working conditions to student learning
    Given administrators claim teacher working conditions are "employee issues"
    And dismiss working condition advocacy as self-interested
    When teachers document connection between conditions and student outcomes
    Then data shows schools with better planning time have better student results
    And adequate support staff correlates with student wellbeing
    And sustainable teacher workload predicts teacher retention and student consistency
    And working conditions advocacy is reframed as student-centered
    And labor rights and educational quality become aligned not opposed
