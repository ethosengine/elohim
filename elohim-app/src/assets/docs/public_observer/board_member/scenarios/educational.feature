Feature: Education Governance for Board Member
  As a school board member in the public_observer system
  Operating at the educational functional layer
  I want independent analysis of education policies and student outcomes
  So that I can make informed decisions serving all students equitably despite lacking education expertise

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the board_member user is registered in the system
    And the educational governance context is active
    And I am a volunteer school board member working full-time elsewhere

  Scenario: Board member evaluates superintendent recommendation to close schools
    Given superintendent recommends closing three schools for efficiency
    And 200-page closure analysis emphasizes cost savings and facility utilization
    And affected communities organized opposition but lack data to counter staff analysis
    When the board member requests Observer independent analysis
    Then they receive impact assessment showing commute time increases for affected families
    And see enrollment data contradicting claims of declining student numbers
    And access demographic analysis showing closures disproportionately affect low-income students
    And get comparison of how peer districts addressed facility challenges without closure
    And independent analysis reveals information staff presentation minimized

  Scenario: Board member learns accessible expertise on special education compliance
    Given district faces federal monitoring for special education compliance issues
    And board must oversee corrective action plan with complex legal requirements
    And board member has no special education or legal background
    When the board member uses Observer to understand the situation
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of IDEA requirements and violations
    And see comparison of district's special education outcomes to state averages
    And access key questions to ask superintendent about implementation capacity
    And get examples of how other districts achieved compliance
    And accessible expertise enables informed oversight without full-time study

  Scenario: Board member tracks implementation of equity-focused discipline policy
    Given board adopted restorative justice policy to reduce suspensions two years ago
    And superintendent reported successful implementation at board meetings
    And community members report ongoing disparate discipline of students of color
    When the board member uses Observer implementation tracking
    Then they see suspension rates by school, race, and disability status over time
    And discover overall suspensions declined but disparities remained or widened
    And find some schools implemented restorative practices while others didn't
    And access teacher training data showing incomplete implementation
    And impact tracking reveals gap between board policy and actual outcomes

  Scenario: Board member evaluates achievement gap despite test score improvements
    Given superintendent presents improving test scores as evidence of success
    And board wants to understand if all students are benefiting from improvements
    And media reports question equity of district's progress
    When the board member uses Observer educational equity analysis
    Then they receive achievement data disaggregated by race, income, and language
    And see average scores improved but gaps between groups widened
    And access analysis showing advanced course access concentrated in affluent schools
    And discover resource distribution favoring already-high-performing schools
    And equity analysis reveals which students are and aren't being served well

  Scenario: Board member understands community priorities on curriculum controversy
    Given board faces decision on proposed curriculum adoption
    And board meetings dominated by organized groups advocating strong positions
    And board wants to understand broader parent and educator perspectives
    When the board member seeks community accountability data from Observer
    Then they receive survey data from representative sample of district families
    And see teacher professional judgment on curriculum separate from union position
    And access student learning outcome data from districts using proposed curriculum
    And understand concerns of diverse communities beyond organized advocacy
    And community accountability helps board make decision aligned with broader interests

  Scenario: Board member detects potential conflict of interest in vendor contract
    Given district staff recommends multi-million dollar contract with education technology vendor
    And superintendent emphasizes vendor's qualifications and student benefit claims
    And board will vote on contract at next meeting
    When the board member uses Observer capture protection analysis
    Then they discover vendor hired former district administrator as consultant
    And see vendor's student outcome claims not supported by independent research
    And find contract terms more favorable to vendor than peer district contracts
    And access alternative vendors with better evidence and more standard terms
    And capture protection makes relationships and manipulation tactics visible

  Scenario: Board member evaluates budget allocating resources across schools
    Given superintendent proposes budget with significant changes to school staffing
    And budget presentation emphasizes district-wide efficiency and priorities
    And board wants to understand impacts on different schools and student populations
    When the board member requests Observer resource equity analysis
    Then they receive per-pupil spending comparison across all district schools
    And see staffing changes impact by school demographics and current performance
    And access analysis of which students gain versus lose resources under proposal
    And discover budget concentrates cuts in already-struggling schools
    And equity analysis reveals disparate impacts staff presentation minimized

  Scenario: Board member prepares for teacher contract negotiation
    Given board must negotiate collective bargaining agreement with teachers union
    And superintendent provides analysis emphasizing district's budget constraints
    And board wants to balance fiscal responsibility with teacher retention and quality
    When the board member uses Observer labor relations context
    Then they receive comparison of district's teacher compensation to regional market
    And see teacher turnover and vacancy data by school showing retention challenges
    And access analysis of contract proposals' impact on recruitment and budget
    And get examples of creative solutions from peer district negotiations
    And accessible expertise helps board negotiate effectively

  Scenario: Board member evaluates superintendent performance with outcome data
    Given board conducts annual superintendent evaluation
    And superintendent's self-evaluation emphasizes accomplishments and progress
    And board wants objective assessment of district performance during tenure
    When the board member uses Observer accountability tracking
    Then they receive longitudinal data on student outcomes since superintendent started
    And see progress on board priorities and strategic plan goals
    And access comparison of district performance trajectory to similar districts
    And discover some promised improvements didn't materialize or regressed
    And objective data helps board evaluate performance beyond self-reporting
