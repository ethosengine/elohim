Feature: Employment and Labor Accountability for Developer Interests
  As a developer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer
  I want transparent labor practices and honest job creation accounting
  So that responsible employment practices create competitive advantage

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the developer_interests user is registered in the system
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active

  Scenario: Developer receives honest job creation analysis
    Given a developer claims project will "create 200 jobs"
    And uses job creation to justify public subsidies
    When the Observer provides independent employment impact analysis
    Then the developer sees: 180 jobs are temporary construction jobs
    And only 20 are permanent positions
    And median permanent job wage is $15/hour in area with $22/hour living wage
    And honest accounting distinguishes temporary versus permanent employment
    And job quality matters as much as job quantity

  Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates quality job creation
    Given a responsible developer prioritizes workforce development
    And creates genuine employment opportunities for local residents
    When the Observer documents employment track record
    Then analysis shows: 85% of jobs went to local residents
    And median wage is $24/hour with benefits
    And developer provides apprenticeship programs for construction trades
    And permanent jobs offer career advancement opportunities
    And quality employment becomes competitive advantage for approvals

  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for labor violations
    Given a developer has history of wage theft and safety violations
    And now seeks public subsidies for new project
    When the Observer surfaces labor practice track record
    Then analysis shows: 47 wage and hour violations over five years
    And 23 OSHA safety citations across projects
    And pattern of worker exploitation not isolated incidents
    And public subsidies shouldn't reward developers who exploit workers
    And labor accountability becomes approval consideration

  Scenario: Developer worker safety record affects reputation
    Given a responsible developer maintains excellent safety practices
    And invests in worker protection beyond minimum requirements
    When the Observer tracks workplace safety performance
    Then the developer shows: zero serious injuries over 8 projects
    And safety training exceeds industry standards
    And workers report positive working conditions
    And safety commitment creates positive reputation with workers and community
    And responsible practices support recruitment and retention

  Scenario: Developer local hiring commitment gains enforcement
    Given a developer promised 60% local hiring as approval condition
    And community counted on jobs for neighborhood residents
    When the Observer tracks hiring outcomes
    Then analysis shows: only 22% of jobs went to local residents
    And most workers came from outside region
    And community that bore development impacts didn't receive promised jobs
    And accountability creates consequences for broken employment commitments
    And future commitments require enforceable mechanisms

  Scenario: Developer union relations become transparency issue
    Given a developer has pattern of union-busting and labor resistance
    And claims to support workers while fighting unionization
    When the Observer documents labor relations history
    Then analysis shows: developer spent $400K on union-busting consultants
    And filed NLRB complaints against worker organizing attempts
    And rhetoric about supporting workers contradicts anti-union actions
    And labor relations pattern becomes visible to workers and community
    And developers face accountability for anti-worker practices

  Scenario: Developer prevailing wage compliance gains monitoring
    Given a developer receives public subsidy requiring prevailing wage
    And claims compliance with wage requirements
    When the Observer monitors wage compliance
    Then analysis shows: certified payroll reports show prevailing wage
    But worker interviews reveal unpaid overtime and deductions
    And actual take-home pay is below prevailing wage requirements
    And compliance on paper differs from worker reality
    And enforcement mechanisms need worker-centered monitoring

  Scenario: Responsible developer benefits from positive labor reputation
    Given a responsible developer treats workers well consistently
    And has track record of fair wages, safe conditions, and respect
    When the Observer makes labor reputation visible
    Then the developer shows: zero labor violations across 12 projects
    And worker testimonials describe positive treatment and fair practices
    And unions support developer's projects because of good labor relations
    And positive labor reputation creates advantages in competitive approvals
    And responsible employment practices strengthen business success

  Scenario: Developer employment impacts on community economics
    Given a developer's project will employ 150 construction workers
    And claims significant economic impact on local economy
    When the Observer analyzes actual community economic impacts
    Then analysis shows: most workers spend earnings in home communities not locally
    And temporary jobs create temporary spending not sustained economic benefit
    And few local businesses benefit from construction employment
    And honest economic analysis reveals limited community benefit
    And employment claims need scrutiny about actual community economics

  Scenario: Developer apprenticeship commitment creates lasting benefit
    Given a responsible developer commits to workforce development
    And partners with unions and training programs
    When the Observer tracks workforce development outcomes
    Then analysis shows: 35 apprentices trained across three projects
    And 28 completed programs and gained journey-level employment
    And investment in workforce development creates lasting community benefit
    And genuine partnerships distinguish from token training gestures
    And workforce development commitment creates positive legacy
