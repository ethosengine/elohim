Feature: Environmental Development Accountability for Developer Interests
  As a developer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the ecological governance layer
  I want transparent environmental standards and honest sustainability
  So that genuine environmental responsibility creates competitive advantage

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the developer_interests user is registered in the system
    And the ecological governance context is active

  Scenario: Responsible developer demonstrates genuine sustainability commitment
    Given a developer builds with high environmental standards
    And wants sustainability track record to be visible and valued
    When the Observer documents environmental performance
    Then the developer shows: LEED Platinum certification on 8 of 10 projects
    And stormwater management exceeds regulatory requirements by 40%
    And green infrastructure investment totals $4M beyond minimum requirements
    And environmental commitments were kept not just promised
    And genuine sustainability creates market differentiation

  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for greenwashing
    Given a developer claims "sustainable development" in marketing materials
    But environmental review shows minimal actual sustainability
    When the Observer compares sustainability claims to actual practices
    Then analysis reveals: LEED certification was "certified" not "platinum"
    And green features are minimal required by code not additional commitment
    And environmental impact study understated habitat destruction
    And sustainability marketing exceeds actual environmental performance
    And greenwashing faces uncomfortable transparency

  Scenario: Developer environmental review gains honest analysis
    Given a developer's environmental impact report claims minimal impacts
    And used consultant known for developer-friendly assessments
    When the Observer provides independent environmental analysis
    Then comparison shows: wetland impacts understated by 60%
    And habitat loss affects threatened species not mentioned
    And stormwater runoff calculations omit downstream impacts
    And independent assessment reveals actual environmental costs
    And rubber-stamp reviews face evidence-based scrutiny

  Scenario: Developer track record on environmental commitments
    Given a developer promised tree preservation in previous projects
    And claimed environmental mitigation would offset impacts
    When the Observer tracks environmental commitment delivery
    Then analysis shows: 67% of preserved trees died within two years
    And mitigation site was not maintained as required
    And environmental monitoring was incomplete and inadequate
    And pattern shows promises made to gain approval not kept in practice
    And accountability creates pressure for genuine environmental stewardship

  Scenario: Responsible developer benefits from climate adaptation standards
    Given a developer invests in climate-resilient building practices
    And exceeds flood protection and heat mitigation requirements
    When the Observer documents climate adaptation performance
    Then the developer shows: flood resilience investment prevented $2M damages
    And urban heat island mitigation reduced cooling costs 30%
    And climate adaptation creates long-term property value
    And responsible practices gain competitive advantage as climate risks increase
    And genuine adaptation distinguishes from minimal compliance

  Scenario: Developer faces accountability for environmental justice impacts
    Given a developer's projects concentrate in communities of color
    And environmental impacts burden already over-polluted neighborhoods
    When the Observer analyzes environmental justice patterns
    Then analysis shows: development increases pollution in Black neighborhoods
    And environmental benefits (parks, trees) go to white affluent areas
    And cumulative environmental burden violates environmental justice principles
    And pattern reveals extraction from vulnerable communities
    And environmental justice analysis demands equitable development

  Scenario: Developer habitat destruction versus mitigation reality
    Given a developer destroys 40 acres of forest for development
    And promises habitat mitigation will offset ecological loss
    When the Observer tracks mitigation outcomes over five years
    Then analysis shows: mitigation site has 40% native species survival
    And ecological function is fraction of destroyed habitat
    And offset calculation was based on optimistic assumptions not reality
    And net ecological loss is substantial despite mitigation promises
    And honest accounting informs better environmental protection policy

  Scenario: Developer water quality impacts gain watershed accountability
    Given a developer's projects increase impervious surface and runoff
    And environmental review addressed only immediate site impacts
    When the Observer analyzes watershed-scale water quality impacts
    Then analysis shows: cumulative development degraded stream quality
    And downstream communities face flooding and pollution impacts
    And watershed perspective reveals impacts ignored in site-level review
    And developer contribution to cumulative harm becomes visible
    And watershed accountability demands comprehensive impact assessment
