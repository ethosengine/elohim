Feature: State Legislature Governance for Elected Representative
  As a politician in the public_observer system
  Operating at the provincial_state governance layer
  I want to understand statewide patterns and policy impacts
  So that I can legislate effectively for millions of constituents despite lobbying pressure and complexity

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the politician user is registered in the system
    And the provincial_state governance context is active

  Scenario: State legislator surfaces constituent priorities across diverse district
    Given the politician represents 200,000 residents across urban and rural areas
    And hears disproportionately from organized lobbying campaigns
    When the Observer aggregates constituent intelligence
    Then they see healthcare affordability is top concern across demographics
    And identify rural transportation barriers affecting economic opportunity
    And learn working families struggle with childcare costs statewide
    And understand constituent priorities beyond lobbying group demands
    And align legislative agenda with actual community needs

  Scenario: Legislator evaluates major bill with comprehensive impact analysis
    Given education reform legislation has 200 pages
    And supporters present optimistic outcomes while opponents predict disaster
    When the Observer provides evidence-based impact analysis
    Then they see how similar legislation performed in other states
    And understand fiscal impacts on districts with different demographics
    And identify which students benefit versus harmed by changes
    And review educator and parent perspectives from constituent communities
    And make informed vote beyond partisan talking points

  Scenario: State legislator tracks accountability for legislative commitments
    Given the politician co-sponsored criminal justice reform bill
    And committed to reducing incarceration rates
    When the Observer monitors policy implementation
    Then they see whether state agencies implement legislative intent
    And track incarceration trends after legislation passage
    And identify bureaucratic resistance to reform
    And receive alerts when outcomes diverge from expectations
    And intervene to ensure legislation achieves intended impact

  Scenario: Legislator distinguishes constituent calls from corporate astroturf
    Given the politician's office receives 500 calls opposing regulation
    And callers claim to be concerned constituents
    When the Observer analyzes campaign origins
    Then they see calls coordinated by corporate lobbying firm
    And identify script language and coordinated timing
    And distinguish 12 genuine constituent concerns from 488 manufactured contacts
    And understand industry opposition versus authentic community sentiment
    And vote based on constituent interests not manufactured pressure

  Scenario: State legislator builds coalition for statewide healthcare reform
    Given the politician champions Medicaid expansion
    And needs bipartisan support for passage
    When the Observer identifies coalition building opportunities
    Then they see rural hospitals support expansion for financial survival
    And identify business groups concerned about employee healthcare costs
    And connect with faith organizations serving uninsured populations
    And map which legislators have constituent pressure for expansion
    And build diverse coalition across partisan and geographic divides

  Scenario: Legislator exposes statewide funding formula creating district inequities
    Given education funding formula creates disparities
    When the Observer analyzes statewide funding patterns
    Then they see low-income districts receive $3,000 less per student
    And identify property tax base driving inequitable outcomes
    And connect families in underfunded districts across state
    And compare state formula to more equitable models in other states
    And champion funding reform with comprehensive evidence

  Scenario: State legislator verifies industry claims about regulation impacts
    Given business lobbyists claim environmental regulation will destroy jobs
    And present alarming economic analysis
    When the Observer fact-checks industry projections
    Then they see similar regulations in other states
    And review actual employment impacts versus predicted job losses
    And identify which industries comply without job losses
    And understand costs of inaction (health impacts, environmental damage)
    And resist fear-mongering with evidence-based policy analysis

  Scenario: Legislator monitors state agency implementation across departments
    Given the politician passed legislation affecting multiple agencies
    When the Observer tracks implementation statewide
    Then they see which agencies comply with legislative intent
    And identify bureaucratic resistance to policy changes
    And understand regional variation in policy implementation
    And learn where additional legislative oversight is needed
    And ensure legislative authority translates to executive action

  Scenario: State legislator understands local impacts of statewide policy
    Given the politician represents specific legislative district
    And considers statewide legislation
    When the Observer analyzes district-specific impacts
    Then they see how legislation affects their constituents specifically
    And identify trade-offs between district and statewide interests
    And understand which constituent communities benefit versus harmed
    And explain vote to constituents with local impact data
    And balance representation of district versus state interests

  Scenario: Legislator faces donor pressure with transparency and accountability
    Given the politician received campaign contributions from industry
    And industry lobbyists seek favorable vote on regulation
    When the Observer documents relationship and voting patterns
    Then they see campaign finance connections made publicly visible
    And understand constituents track alignment of votes with donors
    And face accountability for voting with industry versus constituents
    And explain votes with policy rationale not donor influence
    And navigate pressure with transparent evidence-based decision-making
