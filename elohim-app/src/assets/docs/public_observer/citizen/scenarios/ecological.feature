Feature: Ecological Governance for Citizen
  As a citizen in the public_observer system
  Operating at the ecological_bioregional governance layer
  I want to participate in environmental decisions affecting my community
  So that sustainability commitments become action not just performance

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the citizen user is registered in the system
    And the ecological_bioregional governance context is active

  Scenario: Citizen tracks environmental commitment implementation
    Given the city adopted a climate action plan two years ago
    And promised specific sustainability measures
    When the citizen reviews Observer tracking
    Then they see which commitments have been implemented
    And which remain unfulfilled promises
    And view progress on measurable sustainability goals
    And can hold officials accountable for climate action
    And long-term environmental policy gets institutional memory

  Scenario: Citizen identifies environmental justice patterns
    Given the citizen is concerned about neighborhood air quality
    When the Observer analyzes pollution and green space distribution
    Then the citizen sees industrial permits cluster in low-income areas
    And parks and trees concentrate in wealthy neighborhoods
    And environmental burden patterns become undeniable
    And can advocate for equitable environmental policy
    And environmental racism becomes visible and challengeable

  Scenario: Citizen evaluates development environmental claims
    Given a developer claims their project is environmentally sustainable
    And uses terms like "green building" and "eco-friendly"
    When the Observer fact-checks environmental claims
    Then the citizen sees actual environmental review data
    And views the developer's environmental track record
    And understands real impacts on habitat, pollution, resources
    And can distinguish genuine sustainability from greenwashing
    And environmental accountability becomes measurable

  Scenario: Citizen connects to regional environmental patterns
    Given tree canopy loss is occurring in the citizen's neighborhood
    When the Observer surfaces regional ecological data
    Then the citizen learns this is part of citywide pattern
    And sees which areas retain or lose environmental quality
    And discovers other neighborhoods facing similar concerns
    And can join broader environmental coalition
    And local environmental concerns connect to systemic patterns

  Scenario: Citizen participates in park and green space decisions
    Given the city is planning park improvements or closures
    And the citizen values local park access
    When the Observer provides park decision information
    Then the citizen learns about planned changes early enough to respond
    And sees park access and quality distribution across city
    And understands community needs and usage patterns
    And can advocate for equitable green space investment
    And park decisions reflect actual community priorities
