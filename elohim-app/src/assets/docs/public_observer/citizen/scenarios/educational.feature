Feature: Educational Governance for Citizen
  As a citizen in the public_observer system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to understand education policy decisions affecting my community
  So that schools serve children and families effectively

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the citizen user is registered in the system
    And the educational governance context is active

  Scenario: Citizen decodes education policy jargon
    Given the school board discusses "instructional efficiency optimization"
    And the citizen attends or reviews the meeting
    When the Observer translates the education-ese
    Then the citizen learns this means cutting teaching assistants
    And understands the impact is larger class sizes
    And sees the real effect on children's learning
    And can respond to actual impacts vs bureaucratic language
    And education policy becomes accessible to non-experts

  Scenario: Citizen connects municipal decisions to school impacts
    Given a developer proposes 200-unit residential complex
    And claims it will benefit the tax base
    When the Observer calculates educational impacts
    Then the citizen sees 180 new students projected
    And understands infrastructure capacity constraints
    And learns no new school facilities are planned
    And connects municipal development to education quality
    And cross-domain impacts become visible

  Scenario: Citizen evaluates school board candidate claims
    Given a school board candidate promises to improve education quality
    And the election is approaching
    When the citizen reviews Observer analysis
    Then they see the candidate's specific policy positions
    And view comparisons to successful districts' approaches
    And understand likely impacts of proposed policies
    And can evaluate campaign promises against evidence
    And informed voting becomes accessible

  Scenario: Citizen tracks school resource distribution equity
    Given the citizen is concerned about educational equity
    And lives in a diverse municipality
    When the Observer analyzes district resource patterns
    Then the citizen sees which schools get experienced teachers
    And views facility quality across neighborhoods
    And identifies program access disparities (gifted, AP, arts)
    And understands systematic resource distribution patterns
    And educational justice concerns become evidence-based

  Scenario: Citizen participates in curriculum policy discussion
    Given the school board is considering curriculum changes
    And the citizen has children or cares about education
    When the Observer provides background and context
    Then the citizen learns what successful curriculum looks like
    And sees teacher professional perspectives on the proposal
    And understands student and parent concerns
    And can contribute informed perspective to discussion
    And participatory democracy extends to educational content
