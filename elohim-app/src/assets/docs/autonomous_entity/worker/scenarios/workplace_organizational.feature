Feature: Democratic Workplace Governance for Worker
  As a worker in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer
  I want democratic control over my workplace operations
  So that we collectively shape our working conditions and value distribution

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And ChickenMax #247 has converted to EAE democratic ownership
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active
    And workers have transitioned from corporate hierarchy to democratic governance

  Scenario: Workers democratically decide on operational schedules
    Given scheduling was previously dictated by management
    And workers had no input on shift assignments
    When the democratic workplace holds a scheduling governance session
    Then Maria proposes a schedule balancing operational needs with worker life needs
    And DeShawn suggests modifications for his college class schedule
    And workers vote on the proposed schedule with governance weight based on seniority and contribution
    And the approved schedule is implemented immediately
    And no manager can override the democratic decision

  Scenario: Democratic value distribution replaces hierarchical extraction
    Given ChickenMax generates $100K monthly revenue
    And elimination of franchise fees freed $48K annually
    When workers hold their quarterly value distribution governance meeting
    Then transparent REA accounting shows complete revenue and cost breakdown
    And workers democratically decide wage allocation ($60K to wages)
    And workers vote on community program funding ($10K to senior meals)
    And workers approve environmental sustainability investment ($8K to regenerative sourcing)
    And every worker sees exactly how value flows and why
    And workers can modify distribution algorithms democratically

  Scenario: Workers recall underperforming coordinator through democratic process
    Given Marcus transitioned from manager to democratic coordinator
    And workers have expressed concerns about his facilitation effectiveness
    When workers initiate a recall process
    Then workplace_elohim facilitates a fair evaluation process
    And Marcus receives specific feedback on coordination failures
    And workers vote on recall with 2/3 supermajority required
    And if recalled, Marcus transitions gracefully with support for next role
    And democratic accountability prevents hierarchical abuse

  Scenario: Worker council makes strategic decisions about business direction
    Given corporate previously mandated menu, pricing, and suppliers
    And workers now govern these strategic decisions democratically
    When Emma proposes direct relationships with local farmers
    Then worker council deliberates on supply chain transition
    And workers analyze cost/benefit of local vs. corporate sourcing
    And workers vote on adopting Johnson Farm as primary vegetable supplier
    And the decision is implemented immediately
    And menu adapts to seasonal availability from democratic supplier relationships

  Scenario: Conflict resolution through democratic process, not managerial fiat
    Given DeShawn and another worker have a scheduling disagreement
    And corporate model would have manager impose solution
    When the conflict is brought to worker council
    Then workplace_elohim facilitates mediated discussion
    And both workers express their perspectives and needs
    And council members propose compromise solutions
    And workers reach consensus on fair schedule accommodation
    And conflict is resolved through transparency and democratic process

  Scenario: Workers democratically hire new team members
    Given ChickenMax needs to hire an additional worker
    And hiring was previously manager's unilateral decision
    When the hiring process begins
    Then workers collectively develop job description and qualifications
    And multiple workers participate in interviewing candidates
    And workers evaluate candidates based on skill fit and values alignment
    And final hiring decision requires worker council approval
    And new hires integrate into democratic culture from day one

  Scenario: Democratic workplace implements innovation suggested by worker
    Given Emma has identified a workflow optimization
    And corporate system previously prohibited worker-initiated changes
    When Emma proposes the optimization at worker council meeting
    Then workers deliberate on implementation feasibility
    And workers vote to pilot Emma's optimization for two weeks
    And results are measured and shared transparently
    And if successful, Emma's innovation is permanently adopted
    And Emma receives recognition and compensation for the contribution

  Scenario: Workers set quality standards democratically, not corporate mandates
    Given corporate enforced speed metrics that eroded quality
    And workers value quality and customer satisfaction over transaction speed
    When workers establish their own quality standards
    Then worker council defines quality metrics emphasizing care and excellence
    And workers reject corporate-style speedup pressure
    And customer feedback is incorporated through democratic review
    And workers balance efficiency with dignity and quality
    And workplace_elohim ensures standards maintain business sustainability

  Scenario: Workers exercise governance voice weighted by documented contribution
    Given REA accounting documents each worker's contributions over time
    And democratic governance weights votes by contribution and seniority
    When workers vote on major strategic decisions
    Then Maria's 8 years of documented expertise weights her vote higher
    And newer workers have proportional but meaningful voice
    And weighting is transparent and democratically adjustable
    And workplace_elohim ensures weighting doesn't become oligarchic
    And all workers maintain baseline voice protecting their dignity

  Scenario: Workers transition from corporate extraction to democratic ownership progressively
    Given ChickenMax has just converted to EAE ownership
    And workers are learning democratic governance practices
    When workers hold their first month of democratic operations
    Then early decisions are worker-proposed, coordinator-advised, worker-approved
    And workers gradually take on more complex governance decisions
    And training is provided for business operations, bookkeeping, and strategy
    And workplace_elohim facilitates learning democratic skills
    And after 6 months, workers govern fully with coordinator in support role only

  Scenario: Workers access transparent financial information previously hidden by corporate
    Given corporate kept financial information opaque to workers
    And workers now have complete financial transparency
    When workers access the financial dashboard
    Then they see real-time revenue, costs, and profit
    And they see exactly how much was previously extracted by franchise fees
    And they see supplier costs and markup comparisons
    And they see complete compensation breakdown for all workers
    And they can audit any financial transaction
    And workplace_elohim ensures financial literacy support for all workers
