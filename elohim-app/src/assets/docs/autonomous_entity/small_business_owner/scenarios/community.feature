Feature: Community Institution Building for Small Business Owner
  As a small_business_owner in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want my business to become genuine community institution
  So that neighborhood embeddedness is preserved and deepened beyond individual ownership

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Rosa's Auto Repair has served the neighborhood for 15 years
    And the community governance context is active
    And EAE conversion enables institutionalizing community stewardship

  Scenario: Business legacy transforms from individual ownership to community institution
    Given Rosa built more than business—she created community institution
    And neighbors trust her shop because they trust her personally
    When conversion to democratic ownership formalizes community commitment
    Then Rosa's 15 years of community stewardship is honored and documented
    And sponsorships (youth soccer, school fundraisers) continue under democratic governance
    And informal credit for struggling families becomes formalized support program
    And community institution is preserved beyond Rosa's personal involvement
    And legacy becomes "founder who chose community over individual wealth"

  Scenario: Customer trust relationships institutionalize through democratic governance
    Given customers bring cars to Rosa because of 15 years of personal trust
    And trust was built through honest work, fair pricing, and community care
    When ownership transitions from individual to democratic
    Then customer histories are documented (with privacy protection)
    And workers inherit trust relationships through Rosa's introduction
    And customers learn their support now benefits worker-owners, not distant capital
    And democratic governance creates transparency deepening trust
    And community_elohim ensures trust institutionalizes beyond individual owner

  Scenario: Neighborhood economic circulation increases through distributed ownership
    Given Rosa's profit ($40K annually) left the neighborhood for her personal use
    And value extraction limited community benefit despite Rosa's generosity
    When democratic ownership distributes value throughout community
    Then worker wage increases ($14 → $18/hour) circulate in neighborhood economy
    And community programs receive dedicated funding from value circulation
    And workers spend locally, supporting other neighborhood businesses
    And multiplier effects amplify as spending cascades through community
    And community_elohim documents wealth circulation vs. previous extraction

  Scenario: Community members invest in preserving neighborhood institution
    Given neighbors value Rosa's Auto but have no ownership pathway
    And community members want to support local businesses beyond patronage
    When community investment pool enables neighborhood participation
    Then neighbors invest modest amounts ($2K-$10K) in acquisition financing
    And investors receive fair return (5% annually) plus social benefit
    And investment enables Rosa's dignified exit while protecting workers
    And community gains democratic governance voice in institution they supported
    And community_elohim manages investment relationships transparently

  Scenario: Business space becomes community gathering place beyond commercial function
    Given auto repair shop could serve community beyond car service
    And neighborhood lacks gathering spaces for organizing and connection
    When democratic governance considers community space usage
    Then workers offer shop space for community meetings after business hours
    And neighborhood organizing groups can use facilities for free
    And youth apprenticeship programs connect young people to skilled trades
    And community bulletin board shares neighborhood information and mutual aid
    And business becomes community hub, not just commercial enterprise

  Scenario: Local supply relationships strengthen through democratic coordination
    Given Rosa bought some supplies from neighborhood vendors
    And democratic network can deepen local sourcing commitments
    When workplace and community governance prioritize local procurement
    Then auto shop sources more supplies from neighborhood businesses
    And EAE network coordination provides volume purchasing to local vendors
    And supplier relationships become mutual support, not just transactions
    And supply chain transparency shows community members how money circulates locally
    And community_elohim coordinates supply chain for maximum local benefit

  Scenario: Community accountability mechanisms ensure democratic governance serves neighborhood
    Given business operates in and depends on community
    And community has legitimate interest in business practices and impacts
    When community governance structures enable neighborhood voice
    Then community stakeholder meetings provide input on business direction
    And neighbors can raise concerns about environmental impacts or labor practices
    And workers consider community feedback in democratic decision-making
    And accountability is transparent and bidirectional (community and workers both accountable)
    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation while protecting worker autonomy

  Scenario: Neighborhood youth gain apprenticeship and ownership pathways
    Given community lacks skilled trades training and economic opportunity for youth
    And Rosa's expertise could benefit next generation but individual ownership prevents scaling
    When democratic governance creates youth apprenticeship program
    Then neighborhood youth learn auto repair skills with paid training
    And apprentices can become worker-owners after demonstrating competency
    And economic opportunity stays in community, not extracting to corporate chains
    And intergenerational knowledge transfer strengthens community resilience
    And community_elohim documents youth pathways from apprenticeship to ownership

  Scenario: Community resilience increases through democratic business network
    Given isolated businesses are vulnerable to economic shocks
    And community resilience depends on interconnected mutual support
    When Rosa's Auto joins EAE network of democratic community businesses
    Then business survives economic downturns through network mutual aid
    And workers coordinate with other democratic enterprises for mutual benefit
    And community institutions support each other rather than competing
    And economic shocks are absorbed collectively, not destroying individual businesses
    And community_elohim coordinates resilience strategies across democratic network

  Scenario: Former owner's community standing shifts from business owner to honored elder
    Given Rosa was known as "business owner" for 15 years
    And her community identity was tied to entrepreneurial success
    When ownership transitions to workers
    Then Rosa's community standing becomes "founder of democratic institution"
    And neighbors honor her choice to prioritize community over maximum profit
    And her wisdom is sought as elder who facilitated transformation
    And community respects her continued participation as resident, not owner
    And community_elohim documents her transition as model for other small business owners

  Scenario: Environmental stewardship practices improve through community accountability
    Given individual ownership limited environmental investment
    And community bears environmental impacts of business operations
    When democratic governance with community input prioritizes sustainability
    Then auto shop invests in proper waste disposal and recycling
    And hazardous materials (oil, antifreeze, batteries) are handled responsibly
    And workers implement environmental improvements community values
    And transparency about environmental practices builds community trust
    And community_elohim documents environmental stewardship for neighborhood benefit

  Scenario: Community celebrates successful transition as demonstration model
    Given neighborhood watched Rosa's difficult decision and graceful transition
    And other small business owners face similar ownership burden challenges
    When transition proves successful for all stakeholders
    Then community honors Rosa at public celebration of democratic conversion
    And her story becomes model encouraging other small business owners to consider conversion
    And neighborhood gains confidence in democratic ownership as viable alternative
    And successful transition demonstrates community can support democratic economy
    And community_elohim shares transition story to inspire broader movement
