Feature: Liberation from Ownership Burden for Small Business Owner
  As a small_business_owner in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want liberation from crushing ownership burden with dignified exit
  So that I achieve security without betraying workers or community

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Rosa owns Rosa's Auto Repair, struggling under ownership burden
    And the individual governance context is active
    And EAE offers acquisition enabling dignified transition

  Scenario: Owner achieves fair compensation for years of sweat equity
    Given Rosa built business through 15 years of underpaid 60-hour weeks
    And business is worth $200K but no ethical buyer exists
    When EAE offers $180K acquisition
    Then Rosa receives payment reflecting equipment value, customer base, and sweat equity
    And payment comes from community investment pool, not worker exploitation
    And Rosa can pay debts, fund retirement, achieve financial breathing room
    And fair value is recognized without requiring community institution destruction

  Scenario: Owner lifts crushing burden of sole responsibility
    Given Rosa carries weight of three employees' livelihoods alone
    And she cannot vacation, get sick, or take breaks without business crisis
    When EAE acquisition completes
    Then Rosa is freed from sole responsibility for business survival
    And employees are protected and elevated to co-owners
    And Rosa can exit completely or stay as transition steward
    And crushing weight of individual ownership is distributed democratically
    And workplace_elohim ensures transition protects all parties

  Scenario: Owner preserves legacy through democratic conversion
    Given Rosa built community institution over 15 years
    And selling to corporate chain would destroy what she created
    When Rosa chooses EAE conversion over extractive sale
    Then her legacy becomes democratic institution serving neighborhood
    And her trust relationships are institutionalized, not erased
    And she becomes founder who chose community over individual wealth
    And legacy is preserved beyond her personal involvement
    And community honors her wisdom in transition choice

  Scenario: Owner transitions identity from sole owner to community elder
    Given Rosa's identity was tied to business ownership
    And exit could mean loss of meaning and social isolation
    When EAE offers transition support
    Then Rosa receives counseling for identity transition
    And Rosa explores new roles: advisor, retiree, community elder
    And Rosa's expertise is valued through consulting compensation
    And transition is honored as life stage, not failure
    And Rosa discovers purpose beyond ownership burden

  Scenario: Owner chooses transition steward role over complete exit
    Given Rosa wants to support workers through conversion
    And she has knowledge essential for smooth transition
    When Rosa selects two-year transition steward option
    Then Rosa earns $55K salary for coordination and knowledge transfer
    And Rosa facilitates workers' growing governance capacity
    And Rosa's role gradually decreases as workers gain capability
    And after two years, Rosa exits gracefully or stays as equal participant
    And workplace_elohim ensures steward role doesn't recreate hierarchy

  Scenario: Owner experiences relief from impossible competitive pressures
    Given Rosa cannot compete with corporate chains on price alone
    And she faces slow death by competition or worker exploitation
    When business converts to EAE network
    Then competitive pressure eases through distributed ownership eliminating extraction
    And network provides volume purchasing power Rosa never had
    And democratic governance enables innovation chains cannot match
    And Rosa experiences relief from impossible economic trap

  Scenario: Owner receives emotional support for ownership loss grief
    Given letting go of business is genuine grief and identity crisis
    And capitalist culture offers no support for this transition
    When EAE provides transition support
    Then Rosa accesses peer support groups with other converted owners
    And Rosa receives therapy for processing ownership loss
    And Rosa's emotional reality is validated and supported
    And transition support recognizes this as major life change requiring care

  Scenario: Owner protects workers while achieving own security
    Given Rosa could sell to buyer who would fire workers and cut quality
    And she refuses to betray workers despite financial pressure
    When EAE acquisition enables both worker protection and owner security
    Then workers gain ownership, higher wages, and governance voice
    And Rosa achieves financial security without worker exploitation
    And false choice between owner security and worker dignity is resolved
    And Rosa's ethical commitments are honored, not punished
