Feature: Democratic Farm Governance and Farmworker Empowerment
  As a supplier in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer
  I want farmworkers to gain ownership and democratic voice
  So that farm transforms from hierarchical extraction to democratic stewardship

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Tom Johnson operates Johnson Farm serving EAE food service network
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active
    And fair farmer compensation enables considering democratic conversion

  Scenario: Farm owner transitions from sole proprietor to worker cooperative facilitator
    Given Tom has owned and operated Johnson Farm individually for 20 years
    And farmworkers have been employees without ownership or governance voice
    When Tom considers converting farm to worker-owned cooperative
    Then he sees how democratic restaurant conversions empowered workers
    And EAE network offers acquisition support for farm democratic conversion
    And Tom can transition from sole owner to cooperative member or honored exit
    And farmworkers gain ownership pathway transforming agricultural labor
    And workplace_elohim facilitates farm conversion following restaurant model

  Scenario: Farmworker expertise in cultivation becomes valued in democratic governance
    Given farmworkers have deep knowledge of soil, crops, and seasonal patterns
    And hierarchical structure meant their expertise was undervalued or ignored
    When democratic governance gives farmworkers decision-making voice
    Then cultivation decisions incorporate workers' hands-on expertise
    And crop selection reflects workers' knowledge of land and climate
    And planting and harvesting schedules balance productivity with worker wellbeing
    And farmworker wisdom shapes farm operations through democratic participation
    And workplace_elohim documents farmworker knowledge and decision contributions

  Scenario: Farm labor practices improve through worker democratic control
    Given Tom paid farmworkers as well as possible but margins were thin
    And workers lacked voice in schedule, breaks, safety, or working conditions
    When farmworkers gain democratic ownership and governance
    Then wages increase to $18/hour minimum from increased farm revenue (direct sales, fair pricing)
    And work schedules accommodate workers' family and health needs
    And safety equipment and protocols improve through worker input
    And agricultural labor transforms from exploited work to dignified livelihood
    And workplace_elohim ensures democratic governance protects farmworker dignity

  Scenario: Seasonal labor challenges are addressed through democratic planning
    Given agricultural work is inherently seasonal creating income volatility
    And farmworkers traditionally face periods of unemployment and poverty
    When democratic governance addresses seasonal labor democratically
    Then year-round base income is guaranteed through diversified farm activities
    And off-season work includes equipment maintenance, planning, and training
    And EAE network coordination provides cross-employment opportunities during slow periods
    And income stability improves farmworker financial security dramatically
    And workplace_elohim coordinates seasonal labor solutions across network

  Scenario: Farm equipment investment decisions become democratically governed
    Given equipment purchases previously were Tom's sole decision
    And workers who use equipment daily had no input on purchases
    When democratic governance includes workers in equipment decisions
    Then farmworkers evaluate equipment options based on usability and safety
    And purchases prioritize worker wellbeing alongside productivity
    And equipment maintenance improves through worker ownership and care
    And investment decisions reflect users' expertise and long-term thinking
    And workplace_elohim facilitates democratic equipment planning and budgeting

  Scenario: Crop diversity increases through democratic decision-making
    Given Tom focused on high-value crops to maximize revenue under thin margins
    And crop diversity benefits soil health and risk distribution
    When democratic governance enables longer-term thinking
    Then workers vote to increase crop diversity supporting soil health
    And diversification reduces dependence on single crop market fluctuations
    And biodiversity increases through worker interest in varied cultivation
    And farm resilience improves through democratic long-term planning
    And workplace_elohim documents crop diversity benefits for economic and ecological health

  Scenario: Farm knowledge transfer becomes systematic institutional practice
    Given Tom's knowledge was concentrated in his experience and tacit expertise
    And knowledge loss would occur if he exited without systematic transfer
    When democratic conversion requires knowledge documentation
    Then Tom's expertise is systematically documented and shared with worker-owners
    And apprenticeship programs formalize knowledge transfer to new farmworkers
    And institutional memory develops preventing knowledge loss through turnover
    And democratic governance ensures continuous learning and knowledge circulation
    And workplace_elohim manages knowledge transfer protocols and documentation

  Scenario: Farmworker recruitment and retention improve through ownership opportunity
    Given agricultural labor traditionally has high turnover due to low pay and poor conditions
    And farm struggled to retain skilled workers who left for better opportunities
    When democratic ownership offers farmworkers equity stake and voice
    Then recruitment improves as workers seek dignified agricultural employment
    And retention increases dramatically (90%+ vs. previous 40% annual retention)
    And institutional expertise accumulates through stable workforce
    And farm benefits from long-term worker commitment and skill development
    And workplace_elohim tracks retention improvements and workforce stability

  Scenario: Democratic governance enables farm innovation through worker collaboration
    Given individual owner structure limited innovation to Tom's ideas and capacity
    And workers had innovative ideas but no mechanism to implement them
    When democratic governance values all workers' innovative contributions
    Then cultivation technique improvements emerge from farmworker experimentation
    And workflow optimizations are tested and refined collaboratively
    And sustainable practice innovations spread through worker knowledge sharing
    And collective intelligence exceeds individual owner capacity
    And workplace_elohim documents innovations and shares across democratic farm network

  Scenario: Farm financial transparency builds trust and informed decision-making
    Given farmworkers previously had no visibility into farm finances
    And lack of transparency created distrust and uninformed compensation discussions
    When democratic governance requires financial transparency
    Then farmworkers see complete financial picture: revenue, costs, margins, investments
    And compensation decisions are informed by transparent profit distribution
    And financial education is provided helping workers understand farm economics
    And trust builds through transparency replacing suspicion from opacity
    And workplace_elohim provides financial transparency dashboards for democratic governance

  Scenario: Farmworker voice prevents owner burnout and distributes responsibility
    Given Tom carried full farm responsibility alone causing stress and burnout
    And sole proprietorship meant he couldn't take breaks without farm crisis
    When democratic governance distributes responsibility across worker-owners
    Then Tom (if staying as cooperative member) is freed from sole responsibility burden
    And farmworkers collectively manage farm reducing individual stress
    And vacation and health breaks become possible for all including Tom
    And democratic distribution of responsibility enables sustainable work-life balance
    And workplace_elohim ensures responsibility distribution is equitable and sustainable

  Scenario: Farm democratic conversion attracts younger generation to agriculture
    Given young people avoid agriculture due to low pay and lack of ownership pathway
    And aging farmer population threatens agricultural knowledge and capacity loss
    When democratic farm offers ownership, dignity, and fair compensation
    Then young people consider agricultural careers with ownership potential
    And generational knowledge transfer occurs through young farmworkers learning from elders
    And sustainable agriculture future is secured through attracting next generation
    And democratic model makes farming viable and attractive livelihood
    And workplace_elohim documents youth engagement in democratic agriculture
