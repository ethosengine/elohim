Feature: Regenerative Agriculture and Bioregional Food System Stewardship
  As a supplier in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the ecological_bioregional governance layer
  I want to practice regenerative agriculture coordinated bioregionally
  So that food system serves ecological health and climate resilience

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Johnson Farm operates within a bioregional ecological context
    And the ecological_bioregional governance context is active
    And democratic network enables bioregional coordination for sustainability

  Scenario: Fair pricing enables transition from extractive to regenerative agriculture
    Given corporate food system made regenerative practices financially impossible
    And Tom wanted to build soil health but thin margins prevented investment
    When democratic network pays sustainability premium for regenerative practices
    Then crop rotation becomes economically viable through diversified revenue
    And cover cropping is compensated as soil-building investment
    And reduced tillage practices are supported despite initial yield reduction
    And regenerative agriculture is profitable, not costly burden
    And bioregional_elohim documents regenerative practice adoption and soil health improvements

  Scenario: Carbon sequestration through farming is measured and valued
    Given industrial agriculture is net carbon emitter through fossil inputs and soil degradation
    And regenerative agriculture sequesters carbon through soil building
    When democratic network values and compensates carbon sequestration
    Then soil carbon is measured showing annual sequestration increases
    And carbon sequestration is compensated through premium pricing or carbon credits
    And farm becomes climate solution, not climate problem
    And documented carbon impacts inform bioregional climate strategy
    And bioregional_elohim tracks carbon sequestration across democratic farm network

  Scenario: Bioregional crop diversity protects against climate disruption
    Given monoculture agriculture is vulnerable to climate shocks
    And bioregional food security requires diverse production
    When democratic farms coordinate bioregional crop diversity
    Then multiple farms grow complementary crops reducing systemic risk
    And crop failures at one farm are buffered by others' success
    And regional food security is protected through diversity
    And climate resilience increases through bioregional coordination
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates crop diversity planning across farms

  Scenario: Watershed protection becomes shared bioregional responsibility
    Given agricultural runoff affects water quality throughout watershed
    And individual farms lack resources or incentives to protect water comprehensively
    When bioregional democratic network coordinates watershed stewardship
    Then farms across watershed implement water protection practices (buffer strips, reduced chemicals)
    And water quality monitoring shows improvement from coordinated stewardship
    And downstream communities benefit from agricultural water protection
    And watershed health becomes collective responsibility with visible benefits
    And bioregional_elohim monitors watershed health and coordinates protection efforts

  Scenario: Biodiversity preservation is integrated into agricultural practice
    Given industrial agriculture destroys biodiversity through monoculture and chemicals
    And biodiversity loss threatens ecosystem resilience and pollination
    When democratic farms prioritize biodiversity as ecological value
    Then pollinator habitat is planted and protected across farms
    And hedgerows and field margins support wildlife and beneficial insects
    And native plant species are incorporated into farm landscapes
    And biodiversity increases measurably through democratic agricultural stewardship
    And bioregional_elohim tracks biodiversity indicators across farm network

  Scenario: Seasonal bioregional coordination provides year-round local food supply
    Given individual farms have limited seasonal production windows
    And year-round local food requires bioregional coordination across climate zones
    When democratic farms coordinate seasonal production bioregionally
    Then farms in different microclimates provide sequential seasonal supply
    And storage and preservation extend local food availability
    And bioregional network reduces dependence on distant, fossil-fuel-intensive supply chains
    And food miles decrease dramatically through bioregional coordination
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates seasonal planning and distribution logistics

  Scenario: Soil health improvements are documented and knowledge is shared
    Given soil degradation is systemic problem in industrial agriculture
    And regenerative soil building requires knowledge and long-term commitment
    When democratic farms document and share soil health practices
    Then soil testing shows organic matter increases and biological activity improvements
    And successful practices are shared across bioregional farm network
    And soil health knowledge accumulates and spreads through democratic coordination
    And bioregional soil regeneration accelerates through collective learning
    And bioregional_elohim manages soil health documentation and knowledge sharing

  Scenario: Pesticide reduction improves ecosystem and human health bioregionally
    Given pesticide use harms pollinators, water quality, farmworker health, and ecosystems
    And individual farms face pest pressure requiring coordinated management
    When democratic farms coordinate integrated pest management bioregionally
    Then pesticide use decreases through ecological pest control methods
    And farmworker health improves from reduced chemical exposure
    And pollinator populations recover from pesticide reduction
    And ecosystem health improves measurably across bioregion
    And bioregional_elohim tracks pesticide reduction and ecosystem health indicators

  Scenario: Climate adaptation strategies are developed and shared bioregionally
    Given climate change creates new agricultural challenges (droughts, floods, heat, pests)
    And adaptation requires experimentation and knowledge sharing
    When democratic farms collaborate on climate adaptation
    Then drought-resistant varieties are tested and shared across network
    And water conservation practices spread through successful demonstration
    And extreme weather response strategies are coordinated bioregionally
    And climate resilience increases through collaborative adaptation
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates climate adaptation research and implementation

  Scenario: Bioregional food system reduces fossil fuel dependence dramatically
    Given industrial food system depends on fossil fuels (synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, transportation)
    And energy transition requires reducing agricultural fossil fuel use
    When democratic bioregional food system prioritizes energy sustainability
    Then local distribution eliminates long-haul transportation energy use
    And organic practices reduce synthetic fertilizer dependence
    And renewable energy powers farm operations and distribution
    And food system fossil fuel use decreases 80%+ through bioregional coordination
    And bioregional_elohim tracks energy use and transition to renewable sources

  Scenario: Traditional and indigenous agricultural knowledge is honored and integrated
    Given industrial agriculture dismissed traditional ecological knowledge
    And indigenous and traditional practices often embody sustainable wisdom
    When democratic bioregional network values diverse agricultural knowledge
    Then indigenous crop varieties and cultivation methods are preserved and used
    And traditional ecological knowledge informs climate adaptation and biodiversity
    And elder farmers and indigenous practitioners share wisdom with network
    And agricultural knowledge diversity strengthens bioregional resilience
    And bioregional_elohim documents and preserves traditional agricultural knowledge

  Scenario: Bioregional food system serves as climate resilience infrastructure
    Given climate disruption threatens food security through crop failures and supply chain breakdown
    And communities need resilient local food production capacity
    When democratic bioregional farm network provides distributed food security
    Then climate shocks are absorbed through network coordination
    And crop failures at individual farms don't create community food insecurity
    And bioregional food sovereignty provides climate resilience
    And food security is protected as climate changes through democratic coordination
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates climate resilience and food security planning

  Scenario: Ecosystem services from regenerative agriculture are measured and valued
    Given regenerative farms provide ecosystem services (water filtration, carbon storage, biodiversity)
    And these services traditionally went uncompensated despite community benefit
    When bioregional network documents and values ecosystem services
    Then water quality improvements from agricultural practices are measured and compensated
    And habitat provision for wildlife and pollinators is documented and valued
    And carbon sequestration generates revenue supporting regenerative practices
    And ecosystem service value enables regenerative agriculture to outcompete extractive industrial model
    And bioregional_elohim measures ecosystem services and facilitates compensation mechanisms
