Feature: Bioregional Sustainable Economy Investment and Stewardship
  As a community_investor in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the ecological_bioregional governance layer
  I want to invest in bioregional ecological sustainability and resilience
  So that capital supports regenerative economy aligned with ecological systems

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Patricia's investments operate within bioregional ecological context
    And the ecological_bioregional governance context is active
    And investment can support bioregional sustainability and climate resilience

  Scenario: Investor capital enables regenerative agriculture transition at bioregional scale
    Given industrial agriculture degrades ecosystems and requires fossil fuel dependence
    And Patricia wants investment supporting ecological regeneration
    When community investment supports democratic farm conversions bioregionally
    Then capital enables farms transitioning to regenerative practices (Johnson Farm and others)
    And bioregional agricultural system shifts toward soil building and carbon sequestration
    And investment supports ecosystem regeneration while providing fair returns
    And food system transformation includes ecological healing
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates regenerative agriculture investment across bioregion

  Scenario: Investment returns include documented environmental benefits
    Given traditional investment ignores or externalizes environmental impacts
    And Patricia wants to know investment's ecological effects
    When democratic businesses document environmental stewardship
    Then impact reports include: carbon sequestered, water quality protected, biodiversity supported
    And environmental benefits are measured using bioregional ecological indicators
    And investment returns are financial plus ecological restoration
    And capital allocation becomes ecological stewardship tool
    And bioregional_elohim provides environmental impact measurement and reporting

  Scenario: Bioregional investment coordination supports local sustainable supply chains
    Given sustainable supply chains require coordination across bioregion
    And Patricia's investment in Maria's Kitchen connects to Johnson Farm investment
    When investment pool coordinates bioregional supply chain development
    Then farm-to-restaurant supply chains are financed as integrated systems
    And bioregional food miles decrease through local sourcing infrastructure
    And investment supports entire sustainable supply chain, not isolated enterprises
    And ecological benefits compound through bioregional coordination
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates supply chain investment across bioregion

  Scenario: Community investment enables renewable energy cooperatives
    Given fossil fuel dependence threatens climate stability
    And Patricia wants investment supporting renewable energy transition
    When community investment expands to renewable energy cooperatives
    Then her capital supports community solar and wind projects
    And democratic energy ownership replaces fossil fuel extraction
    And bioregional energy sovereignty increases through distributed renewables
    And climate mitigation is advanced through values-aligned investment
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates renewable energy cooperative investment

  Scenario: Investor capital supports bioregional watershed protection
    Given water quality depends on land use throughout watershed
    And Patricia's investments affect and depend on watershed health
    When democratic businesses prioritize watershed stewardship
    Then farms implement water protection practices (buffer strips, reduced chemicals, wetland restoration)
    And investment compensates watershed stewardship through sustainability premiums
    And bioregional water quality improves through coordinated investment in sustainable practices
    And community benefits from clean water enabled by investment priorities
    And bioregional_elohim monitors watershed health and coordinates protection investment

  Scenario: Bioregional climate resilience increases through democratic economy investment
    Given climate disruption threatens communities and ecosystems
    And Patricia wants investment supporting adaptation and resilience
    When community investment prioritizes climate-resilient enterprises
    Then democratic farms implement drought-resistant crops and water conservation
    And local food systems reduce vulnerability to supply chain disruptions
    And bioregional economic resilience strengthens through democratic coordination
    And investment builds climate adaptation capacity
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates climate resilience investment and planning

  Scenario: Investment in land trusts protects bioregional ecological integrity
    Given land speculation threatens farmland, forests, and ecosystems
    And Patricia values protecting bioregional ecological infrastructure
    When community investment supports community land trusts
    Then agricultural land is permanently protected from development
    And forests and watersheds are stewarded for ecological health, not timber extraction
    And bioregional ecological integrity is preserved through democratic land governance
    And investment protects ecosystems while generating sustainable returns
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates land trust investment and stewardship

  Scenario: Investor receives education on bioregional ecology and sustainable economics
    Given most investors lack understanding of bioregional ecological systems
    And Patricia wants to make ecologically-informed investment decisions
    When investment network provides bioregional ecology education
    Then she learns about watershed dynamics, soil health, biodiversity, climate impacts
    And investment decisions are informed by ecological understanding
    And investor community develops ecological literacy and stewardship values
    And education strengthens commitment to sustainable investment
    And bioregional_elohim provides ecological education and investment guidance

  Scenario: Bioregional investment network coordinates across municipal boundaries
    Given ecological systems transcend political boundaries
    And Patricia's investments operate within watershed and foodshed, not just municipality
    When community investment coordinates bioregionally across municipalities
    Then capital flows to support bioregional food system (farms across multiple counties)
    And watershed protection is coordinated across jurisdictions
    And bioregional economic development transcends municipal fragmentation
    And ecological coordination enables systemic sustainability
    And bioregional_elohim facilitates cross-jurisdictional investment coordination

  Scenario: Investment supports indigenous land back and traditional ecological knowledge
    Given indigenous peoples have traditional ecological knowledge and land stewardship practices
    And Patricia values supporting indigenous sovereignty and ecological wisdom
    When community investment supports indigenous land back initiatives
    Then capital helps indigenous communities reacquire traditional territories
    And traditional ecological knowledge informs bioregional stewardship
    And investment repairs colonial land theft while supporting ecological regeneration
    And indigenous governance of land improves bioregional ecological health
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates respectful indigenous partnership and investment

  Scenario: Bioregional investment reduces fossil fuel dependence across sectors
    Given fossil fuel dependence threatens climate stability
    And Patricia's investments can support energy transition
    When democratic businesses across bioregion prioritize renewable energy
    Then local food systems eliminate long-haul transportation fossil fuel use
    And businesses invest in renewable energy through community investment support
    And bioregional fossil fuel consumption decreases measurably
    And investment accelerates just energy transition
    And bioregional_elohim tracks energy transition and coordinates renewable investment

  Scenario: Investor participates in bioregional ecological governance
    Given bioregional ecosystems need coordinated stewardship beyond market forces
    And Patricia wants ecological voice in investment governance
    When bioregional democratic economy includes ecological representation
    Then watershed councils, indigenous nations, and ecological scientists participate in investment governance
    And investment decisions consider ecological health alongside economic returns
    And bioregional governance protects ecosystems through democratic accountability
    And ecological limits are respected in economic planning
    And bioregional_elohim facilitates ecological governance participation

  Scenario: Community investment measures success through bioregional flourishing indicators
    Given traditional investment measures only financial returns
    And Patricia wants holistic measurement of investment impacts
    When bioregional investment develops comprehensive success metrics
    Then returns are measured as: financial (5% annually), ecological (carbon sequestered, biodiversity supported)
    And social indicators (living wages, democratic governance, community wellbeing)
    And bioregional health (watershed quality, soil carbon, ecosystem resilience)
    And investment success is holistic bioregional flourishing, not just profit
    And bioregional_elohim provides comprehensive impact measurement framework
