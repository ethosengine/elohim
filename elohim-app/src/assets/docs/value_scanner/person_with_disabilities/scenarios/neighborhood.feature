Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities
  As a person with disabilities participating in neighborhood life
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to contribute to and benefit from neighborhood care economy with full accessibility
  So that I can be a full neighbor whose presence improves the neighborhood for everyone

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the person_with_disabilities user "Alex" is registered in the system
    And Alex lives in a neighborhood with various accessibility barriers
    And Alex uses a wheelchair for mobility
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy
    And Alex participates in neighborhood mutual aid networks

  Scenario: Alex's accessibility advocacy improves neighborhood for everyone
    Given Alex documents accessibility barriers in the neighborhood
    And improved accessibility benefits elderly residents, parents with strollers, delivery workers
    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks Alex's advocacy contributions
    Then Alex's work identifying barriers should accumulate care tokens
    And advocacy for curb cuts, accessible entrances, better lighting benefits whole neighborhood
    And Alex's contributions should be recognized as care work for community
    And the protocol should make visible how disability advocacy serves everyone
    And Alex should be seen as neighborhood improver, not complainer
    And care economy should value Alex's expertise about accessibility
    And neighborhood should understand Alex's work as gift to all residents

  Scenario: Documenting accessibility barriers for collective action
    Given the neighborhood has many accessibility barriers
    And individual complaints often go unaddressed
    When Alex uses the system to document barriers
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should collect systematic barrier data
    And it should identify patterns across multiple residents' reports
    And documentation should support collective advocacy
    And data should enable organized demands for improvements
    And Alex's expertise should strengthen neighborhood organizing
    And the protocol should facilitate collective power-building
    And systematic change should become possible through organized documentation

  Scenario: Neighborhood mutual aid networks include Alex as full participant
    Given Alex participates in neighborhood mutual aid
    And Alex both gives and receives support
    When neighborhood care flows are tracked
    Then Alex should be recognized as mutual aid contributor
    And Alex provides support to neighbors (advice, connection, skills)
    And Alex receives support from neighbors (physical assistance, rides, help)
    And reciprocity should be visible and valued
    And the neighborhood_elohim should track care flows in multiple directions
    And Alex should experience genuine mutuality, not charity
    And interdependence should be normalized as neighborhood practice

  Scenario: Accessible neighborhood events enable Alex's participation
    Given neighborhood events are often inaccessible
    And inaccessibility equals exclusion from community
    When neighborhood events are planned
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should prompt organizers about accessibility
    And it should provide checklist of access considerations
    And Alex should be consulted as accessibility expert
    And venues should be verified for wheelchair access, sensory accommodations
    And accessible events should become neighborhood norm
    And Alex should be able to participate fully in neighborhood life
    And inclusion should be proactive, not reactive

  Scenario: Alex's presence shifts neighborhood culture toward inclusion
    Given neighborhoods often lack disability awareness
    And Alex's participation educates neighbors about disability
    When Alex engages in neighborhood activities
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should track cultural shifts toward inclusion
    And neighbors should learn about accessibility through relationship with Alex
    And disability should become normalized in neighborhood culture
    And Alex's expertise should be sought and valued
    And the neighborhood should become more accessible over time
    And cultural transformation should be recognized as Alex's contribution
    And Alex's care work includes disability education through presence

  Scenario: Neighborhood resources coordinated to support Alex's participation
    Given Alex may need specific support to participate in neighborhood activities
    And neighborhood has resources that could help
    When Alex wants to engage in neighborhood events or projects
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate needed support
    And neighbors might provide transportation, physical assistance, or other help
    And support should be reciprocal within mutual aid framework
    And Alex should not experience this as charity or burden
    And resource coordination should enable participation
    And the protocol should facilitate Alex's full neighborhood engagement
    And access barriers should be solved collectively, not individually

  Scenario: Snow removal and sidewalk maintenance advocacy
    Given Alex uses a wheelchair and inaccessible sidewalks trap Alex at home
    And snow removal is often inadequate
    When winter weather creates accessibility barriers
    Then Alex should be able to document sidewalk problems systematically
    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate snow removal advocacy
    And Alex's mobility needs should be recognized as legitimate priority
    And neighbors should understand that sidewalk access is essential infrastructure
    And collective action should demand better municipal services
    And Alex's advocacy should improve conditions for all residents
    And the neighborhood should support Alex's right to mobility

  Scenario: Neighborhood care tokens value Alex's substantial contributions
    Given Alex contributes significantly to neighborhood care economy
    And traditional metrics don't capture accessibility advocacy value
    When neighborhood care tokens are calculated
    Then Alex's barrier documentation should accumulate tokens
    And Alex's mutual aid participation should be valued appropriately
    And Alex's disability expertise shared with neighbors should count
    And Alex's organizing work should generate care economy standing
    And care tokens should position Alex as neighborhood contributor
    And Alex should be able to access neighborhood resources based on contributions
    And the protocol should make Alex's neighborhood value undeniable

  Scenario: Accessible communication ensures Alex can participate in neighborhood decisions
    Given neighborhood uses various communication methods
    And some methods may exclude Alex
    When neighborhood decisions are made
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should ensure accessible communication
    And neighborhood should use multiple formats (digital, physical, verbal)
    And Alex should have equal access to all neighborhood information
    And voting and input processes should be accessible
    And Alex's voice should be included in neighborhood governance
    And accessibility should be default, not accommodation
    And the protocol should ensure Alex's full participation

  Scenario: Alex mentors other disabled neighbors in advocacy
    Given other disabled people live in the neighborhood
    And many lack confidence in self-advocacy
    When Alex supports other disabled neighbors
    Then this peer mentoring should be recognized as care work
    And the neighborhood_elohim should track Alex's support to disabled community
    And Alex's disability expertise benefits other residents significantly
    And peer support should accumulate care tokens appropriately
    And Alex's leadership in disability community should be valued
    And mentoring should be seen as sophisticated care labor
    And the protocol should recognize Alex's role building disability solidarity

  Scenario: Emergency preparedness includes disability considerations
    Given emergencies affect disabled people disproportionately
    And Alex has specific emergency needs
    When the neighborhood plans for emergencies
    Then Alex should be included in emergency planning
    And neighborhood should know about residents with access needs
    And evacuation plans should accommodate wheelchair users
    And the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate disability-inclusive preparedness
    And Alex's expertise should shape neighborhood emergency protocols
    And disabled neighbors should be protected, not forgotten
    And inclusive planning should reduce vulnerability for all residents

  Scenario: Neighborhood businesses learn accessibility from Alex
    Given local businesses often lack accessibility awareness
    And Alex's feedback could improve business accessibility
    When Alex interacts with neighborhood businesses
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should facilitate Alex providing accessibility feedback
    And businesses should receive Alex's expertise as valuable service
    And improvements should be tracked and celebrated
    And Alex should be compensated for consultation when appropriate
    And accessible businesses benefit from disability community patronage
    And the neighborhood should become more accessible through Alex's guidance
    And Alex's care work includes making local economy accessible

  Scenario: Protecting Alex from neighborhood discrimination
    Given Alex may face discrimination or harassment from neighbors
    And ableism is pervasive in society
    When discrimination occurs
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should help Alex document incidents
    And it should connect Alex to legal resources and advocacy support
    And it should facilitate collective response from supportive neighbors
    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves
    And the protocol should recognize that neighborhoods can be hostile
    And safety resources should be readily available
    And Alex's right to live without discrimination should be defended
