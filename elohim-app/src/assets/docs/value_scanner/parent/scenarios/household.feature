Feature: Household Layer Value Recognition for Parent
  As a parent managing most household care labor
  Operating at the household governance layer
  I want equitable partnership and fair labor distribution
  So that household care is shared and all contributions are valued

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah's household includes her partner and two children
    And Sarah manages 75% of household care labor
    And both Sarah and her partner work full-time
    And the household governance context is active
    And the household_elohim coordinates family care economy
    And household income is approximately $80,000 annually

  Scenario: Making invisible household labor distribution visible to partner
    Given Sarah performs 75% of household care labor
    And her partner believes he "helps around the house"
    When the household_elohim generates labor distribution report
    Then it should show precise breakdown of who does what
    And it should quantify "Sarah: 75%, Partner: 25%"
    And the data should be undeniable and specific
    And the partner should see his contribution is not equitable
    And visibility should enable reality-based conversation
    And the system should make invisible labor undeniably visible

  Scenario: Tracking mental load separately from physical tasks
    Given Sarah manages meal planning, scheduling, inventory, coordination
    And mental labor is typically invisible to partners
    When the household_elohim tracks cognitive labor
    Then it should distinguish planning from execution
    And it should show "Sarah performed 89% of household planning labor this week"
    And mental load should be valued as heavily as physical work
    And the partner should see that "helping with dishes" doesn't equal Sarah's total coordination
    And cognitive labor should become visible and valued
    And the full scope of Sarah's work should be undeniable

  Scenario: Data-informed negotiation for equitable labor distribution
    Given household labor distribution is currently inequitable
    And Sarah wants fair partnership without resentment
    When Sarah and her partner negotiate labor distribution
    Then the household_elohim should provide specific data
    And it should show time spent, complexity of tasks, and mental load
    And it should enable "Let's talk about the 75/25 split" conversation
    And negotiation should be based on reality, not perception
    And the system should support movement toward equity
    And care economy principles should guide fair distribution

  Scenario: Household budget coordination across competing needs
    Given the household has limited financial resources
    And Tommy needs school supplies, Emma needs sports equipment
    And utilities need paying and groceries need buying
    When Sarah manages household budget
    Then the household_elohim should coordinate across all needs
    And it should surface conflicts and trade-offs
    And it should help prioritize based on family values
    And budget decisions should be transparent to both partners
    And financial management should be recognized as skilled labor
    And Sarah's budget work should accumulate care tokens

  Scenario: Household care tokens reflect both partners' contributions
    Given both Sarah and her partner contribute to household
    And contributions are currently very unequal
    When household care tokens are calculated
    Then they should reflect actual labor performed
    And Sarah's 75% contribution should yield 75% of household tokens
    And tokens should give standing in household resource decisions
    And economic equity should follow labor equity
    And care contributions should determine household governance power
    And the partner should understand that tokens reflect actual work

  Scenario: Coordinating children's different developmental needs in household
    Given Tommy (5) needs wonder-preservation
    And Emma (8) needs autonomy-building
    When Sarah coordinates household routines
    Then the household_elohim should help balance different needs
    And it should suggest how to serve both children appropriately
    And it should track whether each child's needs are being met
    And developmental coordination should be recognized as complex work
    And Sarah's skilled navigation of competing needs should be valued
    And household care should serve all members' flourishing

  Scenario: Household inventory management made visible
    Given Sarah tracks what's in the pantry, fridge, and cabinets
    And she knows when milk is running low and what needs replacing
    When the household_elohim tracks inventory management
    Then it should recognize this as sophisticated logistics work
    And it should value the mental tracking Sarah performs
    And it should show "Sarah managed 94% of household inventory awareness"
    And this invisible cognitive labor should become visible
    And inventory management should be valued as professional-grade skill
    And the partner should see this work that he doesn't even know happens

  Scenario: Equitable decision-making based on care contribution
    Given Sarah contributes 75% of household labor
    And household decisions affect everyone
    When major household decisions need to be made
    Then the household_elohim should weight input by care contribution
    And Sarah's voice should carry appropriate weight
    And care tokens should give her standing in decisions
    And those who do the work should have power over the work
    And household governance should be based on care economy equity
    And Sarah should have decision authority matching her labor

  Scenario: Household schedule coordination across four people
    Given Sarah coordinates schedules for herself, partner, Tommy, and Emma
    And everyone has different needs, activities, and constraints
    When Sarah manages the family calendar
    Then the household_elohim should recognize this as complex coordination
    And it should track the cognitive labor of schedule management
    And it should value the dozens of micro-decisions required
    And Sarah's coordination work should be made visible
    And schedule management should accumulate significant care tokens
    And this invisible orchestration should be recognized as skilled work

  Scenario: Household nutrition planning and execution
    Given Sarah plans meals for family nutritional needs
    And she manages Tommy's preferences, Emma's activities, budget constraints
    When Sarah performs nutrition work
    Then the household_elohim should track planning and execution separately
    And it should recognize nutritional knowledge as professional skill
    And it should value meal planning as complex decision-making
    And it should show the full scope: planning, shopping, prep, cooking, cleanup
    And nutrition work should be recognized as health care labor
    And Sarah's nutrition expertise should be valued professionally

  Scenario: Household emotional labor and relationship maintenance
    Given Sarah remembers birthdays, maintains family connections
    And she manages emotional climate and resolves conflicts
    When the household_elohim tracks emotional labor
    Then it should recognize relationship maintenance as valuable work
    And it should track conflict resolution, emotional support, connection-building
    And emotional labor should be valued as heavily as physical labor
    And Sarah's work maintaining family emotional health should be visible
    And the partner should see this typically invisible labor
    And household care economy should value all forms of care

  Scenario: Partner accountability for equitable labor sharing
    Given the household_elohim makes labor distribution visible
    And the partner can see he performs only 25% of household work
    When the partner commits to increasing his contribution
    Then the system should track whether he follows through
    And it should provide accountability for behavioral change
    And it should show whether labor distribution is actually improving
    And accountability should be built into the care economy system
    And moving toward equity should be trackable and measurable
    And the system should support partnership transformation
