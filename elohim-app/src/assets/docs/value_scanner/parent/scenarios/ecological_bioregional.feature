Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Parent
  As a parent preparing children to care for ecological systems
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want to teach environmental stewardship as care economy practice
  So that the next generation understands care extends to living systems

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah is teaching Tommy (5) and Emma (8) environmental values
    And Sarah wants children to understand ecological care as essential
    And the ecological governance context is active
    And the ecological_elohim could coordinate bioregional care economy
    And Sarah is raising children who will inherit climate crisis

  Scenario: Teaching children that environmental care is care work
    Given Sarah wants Tommy and Emma to understand ecological stewardship
    And she's teaching them care economy principles
    When Sarah teaches environmental practices
    Then the ecological_elohim should recognize this as value literacy education
    And teaching ecological care should accumulate care tokens
    And children should learn that caring for environment is care work
    And the system should value environmental education as parenting labor
    And next generation should internalize ecological care as fundamental
    And Sarah's environmental teaching should be recognized and valued

  Scenario: Family consumption patterns aligned with ecological values
    Given Sarah manages household purchasing decisions
    And she wants to minimize environmental harm
    When the Value Scanner tracks family consumption
    Then it should provide ecological impact information
    And it should help Sarah make environmentally responsible choices
    And it should recognize trade-offs between budget and sustainability
    And the system should support ecological decision-making
    And family care economy should include environmental care
    And Sarah's work to reduce harm should be valued

  Scenario: Waste reduction as household care contribution
    Given Sarah manages household waste and recycling
    And reducing waste requires planning and effort
    When the ecological_elohim tracks waste reduction work
    Then it should recognize waste management as care labor
    And it should value Sarah's composting, recycling, waste minimization
    And it should quantify environmental benefit of her work
    And waste reduction should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should make invisible ecological labor visible
    And Sarah's environmental care work should be recognized

  Scenario: Teaching children ecological responsibility through food choices
    Given Sarah manages family food system
    And food has enormous environmental impact
    When Sarah teaches Tommy and Emma about food ecology
    Then the educational_elohim should recognize ecological education
    And teaching about local food, seasonal eating, food waste should be valued
    And Sarah's work to build children's food literacy should accumulate tokens
    And the system should recognize ecological food education as care work
    And next generation should learn food as ecological relationship
    And Sarah's teaching should be valued as environmental stewardship

  Scenario: Bioregional connection through local food and resources
    Given Sarah's family lives in specific bioregion
    And connecting to local ecology builds stewardship
    When the ecological_elohim supports bioregional connection
    Then it should help Sarah source local food and resources
    And it should provide information about regional ecology
    And it should recognize Sarah's work to build local connections
    And bioregional care should be valued in care economy
    And the system should support regional ecological engagement
    And Sarah should be rewarded for choosing local over global

  Scenario: Climate anxiety and ecological grief with children
    Given children are aware of environmental crisis
    And Tommy and Emma may experience climate anxiety
    When Sarah supports children's ecological emotions
    Then the personal_agent should recognize this as emotional care work
    And it should help Sarah process her own climate grief
    And it should provide resources for talking with children about climate
    And supporting children's environmental feelings should be valued
    And the system should recognize emotional dimension of ecological parenting
    And Sarah's work navigating climate crisis with children should be supported

  Scenario: Environmental education through direct nature connection
    Given children need connection to living world
    And Sarah takes Tommy and Emma to parks, forests, waterways
    When the ecological_elohim tracks nature-based education
    Then it should recognize outdoor time as valuable educational labor
    And it should value Sarah's work facilitating nature connection
    And teaching through direct ecological experience should accumulate tokens
    And the system should recognize that nature connection is parenting work
    And environmental education should be valued alongside academic learning
    And Sarah's effort to build children's nature relationship should be recognized

  Scenario: Household energy and resource use optimization
    Given Sarah manages household energy and resource consumption
    And reducing usage requires conscious effort and planning
    When the ecological_elohim tracks resource management
    Then it should recognize Sarah's work to minimize consumption
    And it should value conservation as care labor
    And it should quantify environmental benefit of reduced usage
    And resource management should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should recognize ecological household management
    And Sarah's environmental care work should be visible and valued

  Scenario: Teaching children repair, reuse, and circular economy
    Given children learn consumption patterns from parents
    And Sarah wants to teach alternatives to disposable culture
    When Sarah teaches Tommy and Emma to repair and reuse
    Then the educational_elohim should recognize anti-consumerist education
    And teaching circular economy practices should accumulate care tokens
    And Sarah's work to counter disposable culture should be valued
    And the system should recognize teaching sustainable practices
    And next generation should learn to value durability and repair
    And Sarah's cultural transmission work should be recognized

  Scenario: Community environmental projects and collective action
    Given ecological challenges require collective response
    And Sarah participates in community environmental initiatives
    When the ecological_elohim tracks Sarah's environmental activism
    Then it should recognize organizing as ecological care work
    And it should value her participation in community environmental projects
    And activism labor should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should support parent environmental advocacy
    And Sarah's work to build sustainable community should be recognized
    And collective ecological action should be valued as care contribution

  Scenario: Intergenerational ecological responsibility and future generations
    Given Sarah is raising children who will face climate consequences
    And current generation's choices affect future generations
    When the ecological_elohim assesses intergenerational care
    Then it should recognize Sarah's work preparing children for climate future
    And it should value her teaching of environmental responsibility
    And raising environmentally conscious children should be recognized as service to future
    And the system should honor intergenerational ecological care
