Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult
  As a middle-aged adult in the value scanner system
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want to integrate care for people with care for planet through sustainable practices
  So that I model ecological stewardship for the next generation and build resilient bioregional care economy

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the middle-aged user "Robert" is registered in the system
    And Robert is 52 years old managing household and multigenerational care
    And the ecological governance context is active
    And bioregional_elohim coordinates ecological care economy
    And Robert's consumption and care practices affect ecological systems

  Scenario: Household consumption patterns analyzed for ecological impact
    Given Robert's household consumes resources and generates waste
    And consumption choices affect ecological systems
    And middle-aged adults often have highest consumption footprint
    When bioregional_elohim analyzes household ecological impact
    Then it should track resource consumption, energy use, and waste generation
    And surface patterns: "Your household consumes 40% above bioregional sustainable average"
    And help Robert understand ecological impact of consumption choices
    And connect consumption to bioregional carrying capacity
    And support reduction strategies that maintain quality of life
    And demonstrate that care economy includes ecological care
    And build household practices that serve bioregional health

  Scenario: Care economy practices integrated with ecological sustainability
    Given care work requires resources: food, transportation, housing, energy
    And care practices can be more or less ecologically sustainable
    And sustainable care economy serves both human and ecological flourishing
    When bioregional_elohim integrates care and ecology
    Then it should help Robert align care practices with ecological sustainability
    And surface opportunities: "Local food sourcing reduces transportation impact while supporting regional care economy"
    And recognize that care for people and care for planet are interconnected
    And support practices that serve both human and ecological wellbeing
    And demonstrate that care economy must be ecologically sustainable
    And build integrated understanding of care and ecology
    And model for next generation that care includes ecological stewardship

  Scenario: Multigenerational teaching about ecological care responsibility

    And care responsibilities create transportation needs
    When bioregional_elohim analyzes transportation
    Then it should track transportation ecological impact
    And help Robert optimize travel to reduce impact while meeting care needs
    And surface alternatives: "Video call could replace 200-mile drive for parent check-in"
    And recognize when care needs require travel despite ecological cost
    And support sustainable transportation choices where possible
    And prevent guilt about necessary care-related travel
    And build transportation patterns that balance care and ecology

  Scenario: Housing and energy use optimized for sustainability
    Given Robert's household uses energy for heating, cooling, and power
    And housing energy use significantly affects ecological impact
    And household improvements can reduce ecological footprint
    When bioregional_elohim supports energy optimization

    And suggest improvements: insulation, renewable energy, efficiency upgrades
    And connect energy reduction to cost savings that support care economy participation
    And help Robert prioritize improvements within household budget
    And recognize that sustainable housing serves current and future generations
    And demonstrate that ecological stewardship is long-term care
    And build household infrastructure that reduces bioregional impact

  Scenario: Bioregional care economy networks reduce consumption through sharing
    Given many resources are underutilized in individual households
    And sharing reduces consumption while building care networks
    And bioregional resilience requires resource cooperation
    When bioregional_elohim facilitates resource sharing
    Then it should connect Robert to bioregional sharing networks
    And support participation in tool libraries, car sharing, and resource exchange
    And recognize that sharing reduces ecological impact and builds care economy
    And track ecological benefits of sharing: "Tool sharing prevented 8 redundant purchases"
    And demonstrate that care economy and ecological sustainability are aligned
    And build bioregional resilience through sharing economy
    And reduce consumption through care economy participation

  Scenario: Lifecycle consumption awareness from birth through end-of-life
    Given Robert has observed full lifecycle from grandchildren to aging parents
    And he recognizes consumption patterns across lifespan
    And lifecycle awareness can inform sustainable choices
    When bioregional_elohim supports lifecycle consumption awareness
    Then it should help Robert understand consumption across full lifecycle
    And surface how current choices affect future generations' ecological inheritance
    And recognize: "Reducing consumption now preserves resources for grandchildren's future"
    And connect present choices to long-term bioregional health
    And support sustainable consumption motivated by intergenerational care
    And demonstrate that ecological stewardship is care for future generations
    And build consumption patterns that serve lifecycle sustainability
