Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Middle-Aged Adult
  As a middle-aged adult (ages 46-64) in the value scanner system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want to maintain individual autonomy and identity amid peak care demands
  So that I can sustain my own flourishing while serving complex multigenerational care responsibilities

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the middle-aged user "Robert" is registered in the system
    And Robert is 52 years old
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Robert's personal_agent is configured for sophisticated coordination
    And Robert has children ages 19 and 22 and parents ages 78 and 75
    And Robert works as a mid-level manager with substantial professional responsibilities

  Scenario: Personal agent coordinates overwhelming complexity across four generations
    Given Robert manages care responsibilities across four generations
    And he tracks his parents' medical appointments and medications
    And he provides financial support and guidance to his adult children
    And he maintains his own household with his spouse
    And he occasionally provides care for his grandchild
    When Robert uses his personal_agent for coordination
    Then the agent should maintain awareness of all contexts simultaneously
    And surface conflicts: "Your father's cardiology appointment conflicts with your work presentation"
    And help him prioritize: "Jordan's apartment deposit is due before your mother's prescription refill"
    And reduce cognitive load by holding details he can't track alone
    And provide sophisticated decision support across multiple time horizons
    And function as genuine coordination partner for managing extreme complexity

  Scenario: Individual identity protected amid overwhelming care demands
    Given Robert's care responsibilities could consume all available time
    And he risks losing individual identity to caregiver role
    When Robert's personal_agent monitors his wellbeing
    Then it should protect space for his own flourishing
    And flag if care demands are eliminating personal time
    And surface when he needs rest, recreation, or personal development
    And recognize: "You haven't had time for yourself in 17 days"
    And help him understand that his own wellbeing enables sustainable care
    And validate that maintaining individual identity is not selfishness
    And support him in setting boundaries that preserve his personhood

  Scenario: Health monitoring as Robert recognizes his own aging
    Given Robert is experiencing early signs of aging
    And he watches his parents navigate health challenges
    And he recognizes his own future care needs
    When Robert tracks his health through his personal_agent
    Then it should monitor age-related health indicators
    And help him establish preventive health practices
    And connect his parents' health patterns to his own future
    And support planning for his own eventual care needs
    And recognize: "Regular exercise now reduces future care burden"
    And help him build health practices that will serve him as he ages
    And prepare him for the transition from care provider to care receiver

  Scenario: Financial autonomy maintained while supporting multiple generations
    Given Robert provides financial support to children
    And he contributes to parents' long-term care costs
    And he maintains his household
    And he saves for his own retirement
    When his personal_agent analyzes his financial situation
    Then it should help him balance competing financial demands
    And protect his own financial security
    And surface when generational support threatens his retirement
    And provide analysis: "Continuing current support level will delay retirement by 3 years"
    And help him make informed tradeoffs
    And ensure he doesn't sacrifice his own future for present generational needs
    And support sustainable multigenerational financial planning

  Scenario: Career development balanced with peak care responsibilities
    Given Robert has substantial professional responsibilities
    And his care demands are also at peak levels
    And he has opportunities for career advancement
    When Robert considers professional development opportunities
    Then his personal_agent should help him assess realistic capacity
    And analyze: "This promotion would add 10 hours weekly with your parents needing increased care"
    And support him in making career decisions that honor his full life context
    And help him recognize that care responsibilities are legitimate constraints on career
    And surface when career advancement would create unsustainable burden
    And validate that choosing care over career advancement is reasonable
    And ensure he doesn't sacrifice relationships for professional success

  Scenario: Personal values clarified through complex care decisions
    Given Robert makes difficult decisions about care allocation
    And he must choose between competing legitimate needs
    When he faces value conflicts through his personal_agent
    Then it should help him articulate his core values
    And surface patterns in his decisions
    And recognize: "You've consistently prioritized parent care over children's wants"
    And support him in examining whether his choices align with his values
    And provide space for reflection on what matters most
    And help him develop coherent personal philosophy about care responsibilities
    And respect his authority to define his own values

  Scenario: Stress and burnout monitoring with proactive intervention
    Given Robert carries enormous care burden across contexts
    And middle-aged adults often experience burnout
    And he may not recognize his own exhaustion
    When his personal_agent monitors stress indicators
    Then it should track signs of burnout across his activities
    And recognize patterns: "You've canceled personal activities 8 consecutive weeks"
    And flag when burden becomes unsustainable
    And proactively surface support resources
    And connect him to respite care, counseling, or community support
    And validate that asking for help is strength, not weakness
    And intervene before burnout becomes crisis

  Scenario: Privacy controls for managing sensitive cross-generational information
    Given Robert manages his parents' sensitive health and financial data
    And he coordinates care with his siblings
    And he supports his adult children while respecting their privacy
    When Robert configures privacy settings
    Then he should have granular control over information flows
    And his parents' health data should be protected
    And his children's information should remain private
    And family care coordination should share only relevant data
    And his workplace should not access family health information
    And community governance should see his care contributions without sensitive details
    And privacy boundaries should protect all parties' dignity

  Scenario: Preparing for role reversal as parent-child relationship evolves
    Given Robert's parents increasingly need his care
    And he remembers them caring for him as a child
    And he recognizes his children will someday care for him
    When Robert reflects on lifecycle care patterns
    Then his personal_agent should help him navigate the emotional complexity
    And surface the reciprocity: "Your parents cared for you, you care for them, your children will care for you"
    And support him in maintaining his parents' dignity as he assumes care responsibilities
    And help him model dignified care receiving for his children
    And recognize that role reversal is natural lifecycle transition
    And validate the grief and complexity of watching parents age
    And prepare him for his own eventual care needs

  Scenario: Building care economy leadership through accumulated experience
    Given Robert has decades of care economy participation
    And he has learned what works and what doesn't
    And his position gives him influence
    When Robert considers care economy leadership opportunities
    Then his personal_agent should recognize his accumulated expertise
    And surface opportunities: community boards, policy advocacy, mentoring
    And help him understand that his experience is valuable wisdom
    And connect him to platforms where his voice can influence systems
    And support him in translating personal experience into system improvement
    And recognize that his generation can drive care economy transformation

  Scenario: Learning from care economy participation across life stages
    Given Robert has participated in care economy as child, parent, and adult child
    And he now sees care patterns across the full lifecycle
    When his personal_agent helps him reflect on his care economy journey
    Then it should surface insights from his accumulated experience
    And help him recognize: "You learned care reciprocity from your parents' care for their parents"
    And connect past care received to present care given
    And support him in understanding care as lifecycle reciprocity
    And validate that his care contributions across decades have genuine value
    And help him see that he's building care economy that will serve his own aging
    And recognize his whole life as care economy participation

  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained despite complex commitments
    Given Robert has extensive care economy commitments
    And many people depend on his coordination
    And constitutional constraints protect his agency
    When Robert chooses to disconnect from the system
    Then the disconnection must be honored immediately
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
    And his care contributions should be exportable in standard format
    And alternative coordination support should be surfaced for those who depend on him
    And his right to not participate must be respected
    And he should maintain full control over his participation
