Feature: Individual Layer Autonomy Preservation for Elderly
  As an elderly person (ages 75+) in the value scanner system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want to maintain autonomy and agency over my own life
  So that I remain a person with dignity despite requiring substantial assistance

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elderly user "Helen" is registered in the system
    And Helen is 82 years old
    And Helen manages early-stage dementia and mobility limitations
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Helen's personal_agent is configured for cognitive support
    And Helen's income is $24k/year (Social Security only)

  Scenario: Voice-primary interface adapts to cognitive and physical limitations
    Given Helen has difficulty with small text and complex navigation
    And her mobility makes precise touch targets challenging
    When Helen opens the Value Scanner application
    Then the interface should use voice-primary interaction
    And visual elements should have large fonts and high contrast
    And touch targets should be large and forgiving
    And navigation should be simple with minimal steps
    And the pace should be slow with no time pressure
    And error recovery should be patient and supportive
    And the interface should preserve Helen's dignity throughout

  Scenario: Personal agent provides cognitive support without replacement
    Given Helen experiences memory challenges from early-stage dementia
    And she needs reminders for medications and appointments
    When Helen's personal_agent provides cognitive assistance
    Then it should support her memory without replacing her agency
    And medication reminders should be gentle: "Helen, time for your heart medication"
    And appointment notifications should give adequate lead time
    And the agent should repeat information patiently when needed
    And support should feel like partnership, not management
    And Helen should remain the decision-maker about her own life
    And the agent must never make choices for Helen without explicit delegation

  Scenario: Elderly person maintains choice authority despite assistance needs
    Given Helen's daughter assists with weekly shopping
    And Helen requires help but retains decision-making capacity
    When Helen uses the Value Scanner with assistance
    Then she should still choose which foods she prefers
    And her daughter should facilitate, not decide for her
    And the personal_agent should say "Helen, which apples do you want?"
    And Helen's preferences should be respected and recorded
    And assistance should enhance her autonomy, not diminish it
    And her dignity as decision-maker should be preserved
    And the system should distinguish between needing help and losing authority

  Scenario: Recognition of continued contributions despite care receipt
    Given Helen receives substantial care from family and community
    And she also contributes through mentoring and wisdom sharing
    When Helen shares family stories with great-grandchildren
    Then her care contribution should be recognized and valued
    And her personal_agent should note: "Your stories preserve our family history"
    And care tokens should reflect her continued giving
    And the system should make visible that care flows both directions
    And Helen should experience herself as valued person, not burden
    And reciprocity should be visible even when care flows are asymmetric

  Scenario: Advance directives maintained as authoritative voice
    Given Helen is planning for potential loss of capacity
    And she has specific values about end-of-life care
    When Helen configures her advance directives in the system
    Then her personal_agent should hold and communicate her wishes
    And her values should remain authoritative even if she loses speech
    And medical providers should receive clear advance directive information
    And family should have access to Helen's documented preferences
    And her agency over her own death should be preserved
    And the protocol should ensure her voice guides care when she cannot speak
    And dignity should be maintained throughout end-of-life process

  Scenario: Privacy rights preserved despite family care coordination needs
    Given Helen's family needs information for care coordination
    And Helen retains full personhood and privacy rights
    When Helen's care data is accessed
    Then Helen must maintain control over her own data
    And she must explicitly delegate any family access
    And default should preserve her privacy unless she chooses sharing
    And she is not someone to be managed without consent
    And safety needs do not automatically override privacy rights
    And the system must balance autonomy with necessary coordination
    And Helen remains a person with full rights, not a patient to be managed

  Scenario: Financial constraint management without stigma
    Given Helen's fixed income is $24k/year
    And this is severe resource constraint
    When Helen uses the Value Scanner for purchasing decisions
    Then the system should help her navigate financial limits
    And budget assistance should be provided with dignity
    And no shame should be attached to limited resources
    And community care economy connections should be surfaced
    And food assistance should be presented as legitimate reciprocity
    And her lifetime of contributions should create valid claims on support
    And assistance should flow with respect, not charity

  Scenario: Crisis detection preserves autonomy while ensuring safety
    Given Helen lives alone with family and community support
    And she is at risk for falls and medication errors
    When the system detects potential crisis indicators
    Then safety monitoring should occur without surveillance feeling
    And alerts should go to Helen first when appropriate
    And emergency contacts should be notified only when necessary
    And intervention should preserve her agency: "Helen, you haven't moved in a while. Are you okay?"
    And she should be consulted before family is contacted when possible
    And safety should enhance autonomy, not replace it
    And the system should balance protection with dignity

  Scenario: Continued learning and growth acknowledged at advanced age
    Given Helen participates in senior learning programs
    And she shares ecological wisdom from decades of experience
    When Helen engages with educational content
    Then the system should recognize that learning continues until death
    And her accumulated knowledge should be valued
    And opportunities to share wisdom should be surfaced
    And she should experience ongoing growth and contribution
    And the protocol should reject notion that personhood ends with productivity decline
    And Helen should be supported in remaining engaged with life

  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained despite vulnerability
    Given Helen is elderly and vulnerable
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Helen or her designated advocate chooses to disconnect
    Then the system must honor disconnection immediately
    And no manipulative retention patterns should be employed
    And her right to refuse participation must be absolute
    And vulnerability does not diminish constitutional rights
    And data deletion must occur per her instructions
    And autonomy includes the right to reject the protocol entirely

  Scenario: Identity preserved through memory challenges
    Given Helen's dementia causes increasing memory difficulties
    And her sense of self needs support and continuity
    When her personal_agent interacts with her over time
    Then it should help maintain her identity continuity
    And it should reference her history: "You worked as a teacher for 30 years"
    And it should support her self-concept despite cognitive changes
    And it should remind her of relationships and accomplishments
    And her personhood should remain intact even as memory fades
    And the protocol should serve the human being she remains
    And dignity should be preserved regardless of cognitive capacity
