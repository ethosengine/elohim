Feature: Educational Layer Value Recognition for Teen
  As a teen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want my formal education to integrate with care economy learning
  So that I build comprehensive value literacy and understand education as care work

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teen user "Jasmine" is registered in the system
    And Jasmine is 16 years old and in high school
    And the educational governance context is active
    And educational_elohim coordinates between formal education and care economy
    And Jasmine's personal_agent integrates learning across contexts

  Scenario: Teen learns comprehensive value literacy through integrated education
    Given Jasmine is learning economics in school
    And she practices care economy through Value Scanner daily
    When her educational_elohim integrates these learning contexts
    Then she should understand both market economics and care economics
    And learn how care creates value beyond market exchange
    And develop sophisticated analysis of invisible labor
    And understand household economics, care work recognition, and community participation
    And build foundation for adult economic capability
    And recognize limitations of market-only economic thinking

  Scenario: Applied learning through care economy translates to academic credit
    Given Jasmine manages household budget and coordinates care work
    And these activities involve mathematical reasoning, planning, and analysis
    When educational_elohim analyzes her care economy participation
    Then it should identify applicable learning in her care work
    And surface opportunities for academic recognition
    And connect to teachers: "Jasmine's budget management demonstrates applied math skills"
    And support translation of care contributions into academic credit where appropriate
    And recognize that learning happens across contexts, not just in classrooms
    And validate that care work develops genuine capabilities

  Scenario: Educational resources accessible based on care contributions
    Given Jasmine has accumulated care tokens through contributions
    And the community offers educational programs and tutoring
    When she seeks additional educational support
    Then her care tokens should be convertible to educational access
    And she should be able to use care economy participation to access learning resources
    And educational opportunities should not be limited to those who can pay market rates
    And her demonstrated contribution should give her standing to access education
    And care economy should support educational equity
    And reduce barriers to educational access for contributing community members

  Scenario: Teen understands education itself as care work
    Given Jasmine invests time and effort in her education
    And education develops capability to serve future flourishing
    When educational_elohim frames her learning
    Then education should be understood as care work for her future self
    And investment in capability building should be recognized as care labor
    And she should learn that education serves collective as well as individual good
    And understand that her developing capabilities will serve community needs
    And see education as part of care economy, not separate from it
    And internalize that learning is valuable beyond market return

  Scenario: Career planning integrated with care economy principles
    Given Jasmine is exploring career pathways
    And her personal_agent serves as career counselor
    When she researches potential careers
    Then the agent should help her analyze careers through care economy lens
    And surface how different careers contribute to collective flourishing
    And explore: "How does this work serve others? What care does it provide?"
    And connect her care economy values to career choices
    And help her identify careers aligned with her demonstrated care patterns
    And support her finding work that is meaningful, not just remunerative

  Scenario: Educational institutions recognize teen care contributions
    Given Jasmine volunteers extensively while maintaining academic work
    And educational institutions value "well-rounded" students
    When her school evaluates her holistically
    Then educational_elohim should make her care contributions visible
    And provide comprehensive view of her capabilities beyond grades
    And colleges should see her substantial care economy participation
    And recognize leadership demonstrated through care work
    And value care contributions alongside academic and extracurricular achievements
    And support her access to educational opportunities based on comprehensive participation

  Scenario: Peer collaboration framed as care economy practice
    Given Jasmine collaborates with classmates on group projects
    And peer learning is valuable educational practice
    When educational_elohim tracks collaborative learning
    Then it should frame peer collaboration as care economy
    And recognize that students teaching each other is care work
    And value collaborative learning as mutual care
    And help students understand that knowledge sharing creates collective value
    And build expectation that learning is community practice, not individual competition
    And demonstrate care economy principles in educational contexts

  Scenario: Financial literacy education grounded in real practice
    Given Jasmine manages real budgets and makes real economic decisions
    And school provides financial literacy education
    When educational_elohim integrates school learning with lived experience
    Then abstract financial concepts should connect to her real practice
    And she should learn budgeting through managing actual household budget
    And understand compound interest through her real college savings
    And learn financial planning by making real financial plans
    And develop sophisticated financial capability through practice, not just theory
    And integrate formal education with applied learning

  Scenario: Teen's educational needs supported by community care economy
    Given Jasmine needs school supplies, technology access, and learning resources
    And she has contributed to community care economy
    When educational needs arise
    Then community care tokens should be usable for educational resources
    And community_elohim should coordinate support for her educational success
    And her care contributions should connect to educational opportunity
    And barriers to education should be reduced through care economy networks
    And community investment in her education should reflect her community contribution
    And mutual care should extend to supporting each other's learning

  Scenario: Educational policy informed by teen care economy participation
    Given aggregate data shows how teens balance education with care work
    And many teens provide substantial household labor while in school
    When educational_elohim analyzes patterns across student populations
    Then it should surface insights about care work burden on students
    And inform educational policy about homework loads and scheduling
    And show how household responsibilities affect educational outcomes
    And advocate for policies that recognize student care economy participation
    And push schools to consider whole lives of students, not just academic performance
    And support evidence-based educational policy grounded in student realities

  Scenario: Learning across contexts builds coherent knowledge
    Given Jasmine learns in school, at work, in family, and in community
    And knowledge fragments across contexts
    When her personal_agent integrates learning from all contexts
    Then she should see connections: "Your work customer service builds communication skills valuable in all contexts"
    And understand how different learning experiences reinforce each other
    And develop coherent knowledge rather than fragmented skills
    And learn to translate capabilities across contexts
    And build sophisticated understanding through integrated experience
    And maintain coherent identity while navigating multiple learning environments

  Scenario: Educational aspirations supported through care economy networks
    Given Jasmine aspires to attend college
    And she has accumulated care tokens through years of contribution
    When she applies to colleges and seeks financial support
    Then her care contributions should support her educational transition
    And care tokens should be convertible to educational resources
    And community letters of support should reflect her demonstrated care work
    And care economy network should provide mentorship and guidance
    And her path to higher education should be supported by those she has served
    And care economy should enable educational mobility based on contribution
