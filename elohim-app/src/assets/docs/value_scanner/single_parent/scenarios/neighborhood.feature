Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent
  As a single parent building local support networks
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to access backup care and mutual aid from neighbors
  So that I have local resilience to supplement missing co-parent support

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the single parent user "Maria" is registered in the system
    And Maria manages solo household in a neighborhood context
    And she has no co-parent to provide backup care or emergency support
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy
    And Maria lives in a neighborhood with other families and potential mutual aid networks

  Scenario: Emergency child pickup when Maria is stuck at work
    Given Maria's medical assistant job sometimes requires staying late unexpectedly
    And she has no co-parent to handle emergencies
    When Maria needs emergency child pickup from school or activities
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect her to nearby trusted neighbors
    And neighbors who can help should be identified quickly
    And emergency care should be available based on reciprocal care economy
    And Maria should have backup for inevitable work-parenting conflicts
    And neighborhood mutual aid should replace missing co-parent for emergencies

  Scenario: Connecting with other single parents for resource sharing
    Given Maria shares specific challenges and constraints with other single parents
    And mutual support among single parents is especially valuable
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies community composition
    Then it should connect Maria to other single parents in her neighborhood
    And it should facilitate resource sharing specific to solo parenting needs
    And it should create peer support network among those with shared experience
    And single parents should find each other for mutual aid and understanding
    And Maria should have neighborhood community that truly gets her situation

  Scenario: Neighbor coordination for carpooling and activity transportation
    Given Maria struggles with impossible logistics of three children's different schedules
    And she has no partner to split transportation duties
    When children need transportation to school, activities, and appointments
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate carpooling with other families
    And it should match families with compatible schedules and destinations
    And it should track reciprocal transportation contributions
    And carpooling should reduce Maria's impossible logistics burden
    And neighborhood coordination should make solo parenting more manageable

  Scenario: Bulk purchasing coordination with neighbors for cost savings
    Given Maria operates on severe budget constraints
    And bulk purchasing saves money but requires coordination
    When neighbors organize bulk buying cooperatives
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate collective purchasing
    And it should help Maria access wholesale prices through group orders
    And it should facilitate cost-sharing and distribution logistics
    And bulk buying should reduce Maria's grocery costs meaningfully
    And neighborhood economic cooperation should help single-parent resource constraints

  Scenario: Tool library and resource sharing to reduce household costs
    Given Maria needs various tools and equipment for household maintenance
    And she cannot afford to buy everything she might occasionally need
    When Maria needs tools or household resources
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate tool library or sharing network
    And neighbors should be able to lend and borrow equipment
    And Maria should access necessary resources without purchasing
    And sharing economy should reduce costs for resource-constrained households
    And neighborhood cooperation should enable household maintenance without partner or money

  Scenario: Emergency meal provision when Maria is sick or overwhelmed
    Given Maria has no co-parent to cook when she's sick or at breaking point
    And she still must feed three children regardless of her state
    When Maria faces health crisis or exhaustion emergency
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should activate meal provision network
    And neighbors should be able to provide emergency meal support
    And Maria should receive help based on her care economy standing, not charity
    And emergency support should be dignified and reciprocal
    And neighborhood should serve as backup for solo parent crisis

  Scenario: After-school supervision coordination for latchkey prevention
    Given Maria works until 5pm while school ends at 3pm
    And she cannot afford formal after-school care for three children
    When children need supervision between school and Maria's work end
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate informal after-school care
    And it should connect Maria to neighbors who are home during those hours
    And it should track reciprocal care contributions to maintain fairness
    And neighborhood coordination should provide affordable childcare solution
    And Maria's children should have safe supervision despite her work schedule

  Scenario: Weekend respite care for desperately needed breaks
    Given Maria parents intensively seven days per week with no co-parent breaks
    And everyone needs occasional rest to remain sustainable
    When Maria needs brief respite from parenting demands
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate respite care offers
    And neighbors should be able to take her children for a few hours
    And Maria should be able to accept respite without guilt or stigma
    And respite should be framed as care economy reciprocity, not charity
    And Maria should get occasional breaks that partnered parents get from co-parents

  Scenario: Neighborhood watch and safety network for single-parent families
    Given Maria worries about household and child safety as solo parent
    And she cannot be everywhere at once
    When neighborhood safety networks operate
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate neighborhood watch efforts
    And neighbors should look out for each other's children and properties
    And Maria should feel enhanced security through community vigilance
    And single-parent households should benefit from neighborhood collective care
    And safety should be community responsibility, not solo parent burden

  Scenario: Skill sharing network for household tasks Maria cannot do alone
    Given some household tasks are difficult or impossible for one person
    And Maria cannot afford to hire professionals for everything
    When Maria needs help with household tasks requiring multiple people or specialized skills
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate skill sharing network
    And neighbors should exchange help based on different capabilities
    And Maria should access household help through reciprocal labor exchange
    And skill sharing should enable household maintenance without money or partner
    And neighborhood cooperation should solve single-parent capability gaps

  Scenario: Local economic cooperation for service cost reduction
    Given Maria struggles to afford household services on limited income
    And neighbors might coordinate for collective cost reduction
    When neighborhood members need similar services
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate group contracting
    And collective service hiring should reduce costs for all participants
    And Maria should access affordable household services through cooperation
    And neighborhood economic coordination should address resource constraints
    And single parents should benefit from collective bargaining power

  Scenario: Preventing social isolation through neighborhood integration
    Given solo parenting is profoundly isolating
    And Maria has limited time and energy for social connection
    When the neighborhood_elohim monitors Maria's social engagement
    Then it should facilitate low-effort neighborhood social integration
    And it should connect her to neighborhood gatherings and events
    And it should enable participation without requiring excessive time or energy
    And neighborhood should provide adult social connection Maria lacks from co-parent
    And Maria should have accessible pathways to community membership despite constraints
