Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Student
  As a student maintaining family connection while establishing independence
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want to participate in family care economy despite geographic distance
  So that family relationships continue while I develop adult autonomy

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the student user "Kenji" is registered in the system
    And Kenji is 20 years old living away from family at college
    And Kenji's family is 300 miles away
    And Kenji receives some financial support from family
    And Kenji maintains regular contact with parents and siblings
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim could coordinate family care across distance

  Scenario: Maintaining family care relationships despite geographic distance
    Given Kenji lives 300 miles from family
    And he cannot provide daily in-person care or support
    When the family_elohim tracks Kenji's family contributions
    Then it should recognize remote emotional support as care work
    And it should value video calls with parents as connection labor
    And it should track time spent supporting younger siblings remotely
    And geographic distance should not make contributions invisible
    And the system should recognize digital care as real care
    And family connection across distance should be valued

  Scenario: Receiving family financial support with dignity
    Given Kenji receives some financial support from family
    And traditional economics treats this as dependency or charity
    When the family_elohim tracks family resource flows
    Then it should frame financial support as family care investment
    And it should recognize that families invest in young members' development
    And it should help Kenji receive support without shame
    And it should track this as reciprocal care economy, not dependency
    And the system should value family investment in student development
    And receiving family support should be dignified participation in family economy

  Scenario: Contributing care work to family despite being student
    Given Kenji provides emotional support to stressed parents
    And he helps younger siblings with homework and advice remotely
    When the family_elohim tracks Kenji's care contributions to family
    Then it should recognize emotional labor supporting family members
    And it should value advice and mentorship provided to siblings
    And it should accumulate care tokens for family support work
    And students should be recognized as care contributors, not just recipients
    And the system should make Kenji's family contributions visible
    And reciprocal care should be recognized even when receiving financial support

  Scenario: Navigating independence while maintaining family belonging
    Given Kenji is establishing adult independence
    And he also wants to remain part of family unit
    When the family_elohim supports this transition
    Then it should help family recognize Kenji's emerging adult status
    And it should maintain his belonging while respecting his autonomy
    And it should facilitate his transition from dependent child to adult family member
    And family relationships should evolve without breaking
    And the system should support healthy independence development
    And Kenji should participate in family as autonomous adult

  Scenario: Family decision-making includes student voice
    Given Kenji is becoming adult family member
    And family makes decisions that affect him
    When family discusses major decisions (moving, finances, elder care)
    Then the family_elohim should ensure Kenji's voice is included
    And it should recognize his emerging adult perspective as valuable
    And it should facilitate his participation despite distance
    And family governance should include student members as participants
    And the system should support transition from child to adult family voice
    And Kenji should participate in family decisions appropriately

  Scenario: Family emergency response across distance
    Given family emergencies can occur while Kenji is at school
    And he may need to return home or provide remote support
    When family crisis occurs (illness, accident, death)
    Then the family_elohim should coordinate crisis response
    And it should help Kenji balance academic obligations with family needs
    And it should facilitate his care contributions from distance if he can't travel
    And it should connect him to campus support if family crisis affects his functioning
    And the system should recognize family crisis impact on student
    And emergency coordination should include geographically distant students

  Scenario: Sharing life learning with family
    Given Kenji is developing new knowledge and capabilities
    And his learning could benefit family members
    When Kenji shares environmental science knowledge with family
    Then the family_elohim should recognize teaching family as care contribution
    And it should value knowledge transfer from student to parents
    And it should recognize reverse mentoring (young teaching old) as valid
    And Kenji's education should benefit whole family, not just himself
    And the system should value educational contributions to family
    And students should be recognized as bringing new knowledge to family

  Scenario: Coordinating family visits and holiday logistics
    Given Kenji returns home for holidays and breaks
    And visit logistics require coordination and resources
    When the family_elohim manages visit planning
    Then it should coordinate schedules across family members
    And it should help plan transportation, meals, and household logistics
    And it should recognize labor involved in maintaining connection across distance
    And it should value family members' work hosting and traveling
    And the system should reduce friction in cross-distance family coordination
    And maintaining family connection should be recognized as work

  Scenario: Family understanding of student financial constraints
    Given Kenji lives on $180/week total budget
    And family might not understand severity of his constraints
    When the family_elohim shares appropriate financial context
    Then it should help family understand Kenji's resource limitations
    And it should facilitate realistic expectations for gift-giving, travel, expenses
    And it should reduce shame around financial scarcity
    And family should understand student economic reality
    And the system should bridge understanding gap about student poverty
    And realistic financial communication should strengthen family relationships

  Scenario: Siblings learning from student care economy practices
    Given Kenji has younger siblings who will become students
    And he's learning valuable care economy skills
    When the family_elohim tracks knowledge transfer
    Then it should recognize Kenji mentoring siblings in life skills
    And it should value his teaching them budgeting, cooking, household management
    And it should accumulate care tokens for mentorship work
    And older siblings should be recognized as teachers for younger ones
    And the system should value peer education within families
    And Kenji's student experience should benefit future student siblings

  Scenario: Family cultural and value transmission across generations
    Given Kenji learned family values and culture growing up
    And he is now interpreting these in young adult context
    When Kenji participates in family cultural practices
    Then the family_elohim should recognize his work maintaining culture
    And it should value his adaptation of family traditions to college life
    And it should support intergenerational transmission of family values
    And cultural work should be recognized as family care labor
    And the system should value students as culture carriers
    And family identity should persist across geographic separation

  Scenario: Recognizing family investment as care economy transaction
    Given Kenji's family invests time, money, and emotional energy in his development
    And Kenji invests in family relationships and contributes what he can
    When the family_elohim tracks family care economy
    Then it should recognize mutual investment across generations
    And it should value family support of student as care contribution
    And it should value student's family participation as reciprocal care
    And family economy should be understood as long-term reciprocal exchange
    And the system should frame family support as investment in flourishing
    And intergenerational care should be recognized as care economy foundation

  Scenario: Student privacy rights within family context
    Given Kenji is legal adult with full privacy rights
    And family relationships involve some appropriate information sharing
    When the family_elohim manages family information
    Then Kenji must have complete control over what family sees
    And parents should not have access to his personal data without consent
    And the system should respect his adult autonomy absolutely
    And family connection should not compromise privacy
    And Kenji should decide what to share with family
    And adult student privacy should be default, non-negotiable
