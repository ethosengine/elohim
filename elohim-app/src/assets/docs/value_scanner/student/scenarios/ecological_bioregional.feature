    And it should show how budget constraint can align with ecological care
    And the system should connect personal shopping to planetary stewardship
    And Kenji should see grocery choices as ecological care work

  Scenario: Recognizing resource constraint as ecological practice
    Given Kenji's $180/week budget forces minimal consumption
    And ecological sustainability requires reduced consumption
    When the bioregional_elohim reframes Kenji's scarcity
    Then it should recognize that living on limited resources is low ecological impact
    And it should validate "Your minimal consumption is ecological stewardship"
    And it should show how his constrained lifestyle aligns with sustainability
    And resource constraint should be recognized as ecological care
    And the system should honor scarcity as ecological practice
    And Kenji should understand his poverty as inadvertently sustainable

    And the system should build bioregional food literacy
    And Kenji should understand food through ecological and regional lens

  Scenario: Academic learning applied to daily ecological choices
    Given Kenji studies environmental science academically
    And he makes consumption decisions daily
    When the bioregional_elohim connects learning to practice
    Then it should help him apply academic knowledge to personal choices
    And it should show "Your understanding of nitrogen cycles informs food decisions"
    And it should bridge theory and practice
    And it should recognize his daily life as laboratory for ecological care
    And the system should integrate academic and practical ecological knowledge
    And Kenji should live his environmental science education

  Scenario: Ecological impact of household coordination
    Given Kenji lives with three roommates
    And household coordination can reduce ecological impact
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks household ecological practices
    Then it should recognize shared living as ecologically efficient
    And it should show how cooking for four is more efficient than four cooking separately
    And it should value household bulk buying as reducing packaging waste
    And it should accumulate care tokens for ecological household practices
    And the system should recognize household coordination as ecological care
    And shared living should be valued as sustainability practice

  Scenario: Transportation choices and ecological impact
    Given Kenji walks most places due to lack of car
    And walking has minimal ecological impact
    When the bioregional_elohim tracks transportation
    Then it should recognize walking as ecological care contribution
    And it should accumulate care tokens for low-impact transportation
    And it should show "Walking instead of driving prevented X carbon emissions"
    And it should validate that poverty can align with ecological values
    And the system should recognize low-impact mobility as care work
    And Kenji should see his car-free life as ecological stewardship

  Scenario: Connecting personal consumption to planetary boundaries
    Given Kenji's consumption choices aggregate with billions of others
    And planetary boundaries define sustainable resource use
    When the bioregional_elohim shows planetary context
    Then it should help Kenji understand his consumption in global context
    And it should show "Your consumption is well below sustainable average"
    And it should connect personal choices to planetary care economy
    And it should teach him that individual actions scale to collective impact
    And the system should bridge personal and planetary scales
    And Kenji should understand himself as participant in planetary care economy

  Scenario: Campus environmental advocacy as ecological care work
    Given Kenji's college has environmental impact and policies
    And students can advocate for institutional sustainability
    When Kenji participates in campus environmental organizing
    Then the bioregional_elohim should recognize advocacy as ecological care work
    And it should accumulate care tokens for environmental activism
    And it should value organizing for institutional change
    And it should recognize that systemic change requires collective action
    And the system should support student environmental advocacy
    And campus organizing should be understood as ecological care economy work

  Scenario: Learning bioregional ecological patterns
