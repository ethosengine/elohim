Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Young Child
  As a young child (ages 5-7) in the value scanner system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want my personal choices and care contributions to be recognized
  So that I learn that my agency matters and care creates value

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the young_child user "Tommy" is registered in the system
    And Tommy is 5 years old
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Tommy's personal_agent is configured for wonder preservation
    And parental oversight is enabled

  Scenario: Wonder-preserving interface for making care choices
    Given Tommy is using the Value Scanner for the first time
    And the interface is optimized for ages 5-7
    When Tommy opens the scanner application
    Then the interface should display large, colorful icons
    And the personal_agent should use warm, encouraging voice guidance
    And no text requiring reading ability should be mandatory
    And the interface should preserve the magic of choice-making
    And no gamification or point systems should be present

  Scenario: Young child makes autonomous care decision within boundaries
    Given Tommy is selecting fruit for his sister Emma
    And Emma has nut allergies configured in the system
    And the family budget constraints are active
    When Tommy scans strawberries for Emma
    Then his personal_agent should recognize the care intention
    And the agent should say "Remember, Emma loves the red ones"
    And the choice should be recorded as a care contribution
    And Tommy should experience genuine autonomy
    And invisible guardrails should prevent allergen selection
    And Tommy should not be aware of the protective boundaries

  Scenario: Recognition of invisible care labor by 5-year-old
    Given Tommy has chosen strawberries for his sister Emma
    And the care contribution has been recorded
    When the transaction is complete
    Then Tommy's care work should be made visible to the family
    And his personal_agent should provide warm recognition
    And the agent should say "You helped. Your care matters. You made Emma happy."
    And the recognition should feel like love, not data extraction
    And care tokens should be allocated to reflect his contribution
    And no transactional language should be used

  Scenario: Developmental stage appropriate learning through concrete experience
    Given Tommy is learning value literacy
    And he is at the concrete operational stage
    When Tommy makes a care decision in the scanner
    Then the personal_agent should frame choices as care adventures
    And complex economic concepts should not be presented
    And learning should happen through story and relationship
    And the agent should ask "What will make Emma smile?" not "What's the best value?"
    And Tommy should build neural pathways around care-based decision making

  Scenario: Personal agent serves child's flourishing without manipulation
    Given Tommy's personal_agent has AI capabilities
    And Tommy is highly vulnerable to manipulation
    When the personal_agent interacts with Tommy
    Then it must never manipulate through guilt or shame
    And it must never extract data for commercial purposes
    And it must never train Tommy toward consumption patterns
    And it must serve only Tommy's dignity and flourishing
    And it must preserve Tommy's natural generosity from corruption
    And it must set Tommy's baseline expectation that technology serves humans

  Scenario: Privacy protection for young child's data
    Given Tommy's care contributions are being tracked
    And Tommy cannot consent to data sharing
    When Tommy's care data is recorded
    Then all data must stay encrypted on family devices
    And no behavioral profiling for commercial purposes should occur
    And no third-party access should be permitted
    And Tommy's wonder must never be monetized
    And parental controls must govern all data visibility
    And anonymization must occur before any community aggregation

  Scenario: Age-appropriate boundaries feel like safety not surveillance
    Given Tommy's parents have configured family boundaries
    And allergen restrictions are active (Emma's nut allergy)
    And budget limits are set
    And nutritional guidelines are configured
    When Tommy attempts to select an item outside boundaries
    Then the system should gently redirect without explicit restriction
    And Tommy should experience boundaries as natural limits
    And the personal_agent should explain in care terms: "Let's find something Emma can safely eat"
    And Tommy should not feel surveilled or controlled
    And his autonomy should remain genuine within safe parameters

  Scenario: Building identity around care rather than consumption
    Given Tommy has made multiple care contributions over time
    And the system has recognized his caring actions
    When Tommy reflects on his scanner usage
    Then he should experience himself as a valued contributor
    And his identity should be forming around care for others
    And he should understand that invisible work is actually valuable
    And he should not be conditioned toward consumer identity
    And care economy principles should be internalized through experience

  Scenario: Personal agent adapts to individual child's developmental pace
    Given Tommy is 5 years old
    And his developmental pace may differ from age-based averages
    When the personal_agent interacts with Tommy over time
    Then it should observe Tommy's actual capabilities
    And it should adapt guidance to his individual pace
    And it should not enforce rigid age-based expectations
    And it should support Tommy's unique development
    And learning should be paced to Tommy's readiness

  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained even for young child
    Given Tommy has been using the Value Scanner
    And constitutional constraints apply at all layers
    When Tommy or his parents choose to disconnect
    Then the system must honor the disconnection immediately
    And no data retention beyond legal requirements should occur
    And Tommy's right to not participate must be respected
    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed
