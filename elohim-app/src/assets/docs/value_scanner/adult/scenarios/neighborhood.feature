Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Adult
  As an adult participating in neighborhood care economy
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want to engage in resource sharing and mutual aid
  So that neighborhood resilience is built through visible care contributions

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the adult user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah lives in a defined neighborhood
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy
    And multiple households participate in neighborhood care network

  Scenario: Neighborhood resource sharing reduces individual household costs
    Given Sarah's household operates on limited budget
    And neighbors have complementary resources and needs
    When Sarah participates in neighborhood resource sharing
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate bulk buying
    And it should facilitate tool lending among neighbors
    And it should enable childcare exchanges
    And it should reduce costs through collective purchasing
    And neighborhood cooperation should improve household economics

  Scenario: Neighborhood mutual aid network provides crisis support
    Given Sarah or her neighbors may face crises
    And traditional systems often fail to provide timely support
    When a household experiences emergency
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should activate mutual aid network
    And neighbors with capacity should be prompted to help
    And support should be immediate and community-based
    And neighborhood should function as first-line safety net
    And mutual aid should be coordinated effectively

  Scenario: Sarah's care contributions give her standing in neighborhood decisions
    Given Sarah participates actively in neighborhood care economy
    And she contributes to collective well-being
    When neighborhood governance decisions are made
    Then Sarah's care contributions should be visible and valued
    And her accumulated care work should give her voice
    And neighborhood leadership should reflect actual contributions
    And care economy participation should create legitimate standing
    And neighborhood democracy should be based on demonstrated care

  Scenario: Neighborhood childcare coordination supports working parents
    Given Sarah works full-time as a teacher
    And childcare is expensive and inflexible
    When neighborhood coordinates childcare sharing
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should match schedules and needs
    And it should track reciprocal childcare exchanges
    And it should help parents like Sarah support each other
    And childcare costs should be reduced through cooperation
    And quality care should be accessible to working families

  Scenario: Neighborhood food cooperative reduces costs and improves access
    Given Sarah needs to feed family on budget
    And food costs are significant household expense
    When neighborhood organizes food cooperative
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate bulk purchasing
    And it should manage cooperative logistics
    And it should track members' contributions and access
    And food should be more affordable through collective action
    And Sarah's family should have better food security

  Scenario: Neighborhood care economy builds social capital and relationships
    Given Sarah is new to neighborhood
    And social isolation is common in modern life
    When Sarah participates in neighborhood care economy
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect her to other parents
    And it should facilitate relationship-building through care exchanges
    And it should help Sarah build local support network
    And social capital should grow through care participation
    And neighborhood should become genuine community, not just proximity

  Scenario: Neighborhood care contributions visible across households
    Given Sarah contributes to neighborhood care economy
    And neighbors also contribute in various ways
    When neighborhood care patterns are tracked
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should make contributions visible
    And it should show who's contributing what
    And it should identify imbalances in participation
    And it should prompt recognition of neighbors' care work
    And visibility should enable fair neighborhood participation

  Scenario: Neighborhood environmental initiatives coordinate care for place
    Given neighborhood shares common environmental interests
    And ecological care is part of care economy
    When neighborhood organizes environmental initiatives
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate collective action
    And it should track contributions to neighborhood environment
    And it should organize community gardens, clean-ups, sustainability efforts
    And care for place should be recognized as care work
    And neighborhood should steward shared environment

  Scenario: Neighborhood conflict resolution supported by care economy data
    Given neighbors sometimes have conflicts
    And disputes can damage neighborhood cohesion
    When neighborhood conflicts arise
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should provide context from care patterns
    And it should show each party's contributions to neighborhood
    And it should facilitate resolution based on mutual care
    And conflicts should be addressed before they escalate
    And care economy should support neighborhood harmony

  Scenario: Neighborhood privacy balanced with coordination needs
    Given neighborhood care economy requires some data sharing
    And Sarah values her household privacy
    When Sarah participates in neighborhood coordination
    Then she should control what information neighbors see
    And household details should remain private unless shared
    And the neighborhood_elohim should only share aggregated patterns
    And Sarah's privacy should be protected while enabling coordination
    And participation should not require sacrificing privacy

  Scenario: Neighborhood care economy scales to municipal level
    Given Sarah's neighborhood successfully implements care economy
    And multiple neighborhoods could coordinate similarly
    When neighborhood care patterns are established
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should connect to municipal systems
    And it should enable scaling of successful practices
    And neighborhood should serve as building block for municipal care economy
    And local success should inform broader policy
    And care economy should grow from neighborhood up, not top-down

  Scenario: Neighborhood resilience built through care economy practices
    Given traditional economic systems leave neighborhoods vulnerable
    And Sarah wants her neighborhood to be resilient
    When neighborhood adopts care economy practices
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate resource sharing
    And it should build mutual aid capacity
    And it should create social capital through care exchanges
    And neighborhood should become more resilient to crises
    And care economy should strengthen community fabric
