Feature: Municipal Layer Value Recognition for Adult
  As an adult engaging with municipal governance
  Operating at the municipal governance layer
  I want my care contributions to influence public policy
  So that municipal systems recognize and support care economy at scale

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the adult user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah lives in a municipality that recognizes care economy
    And the municipal governance context is active
    And the municipal_elohim coordinates city-level care economy
    And Sarah's accumulated care contributions are tracked

  Scenario: Municipal policy informed by aggregated care economy data
    Given thousands of residents participate in care economy
    And their care patterns generate valuable data
    When municipal policy decisions are made
    Then the municipal_elohim should provide aggregated care work data
    And policy makers should see actual patterns of care labor
    And invisible care work should be quantified at municipal scale
    And policy should be informed by real care economy patterns
    And data should reveal needs that traditional economics miss

  Scenario: Sarah's care contributions give her voice in municipal decisions
    Given Sarah has accumulated substantial care tokens through community work
    And municipal governance affects her family's well-being
    When municipal decisions are being made
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her legitimate standing
    And her voice should carry weight based on demonstrated care
    And municipal democracy should recognize care work as civic participation
    And those who contribute to community should influence community governance
    And care economy should create accountable municipal leadership

  Scenario: Municipal school policy shaped by parent care work advocacy
    Given Sarah works as teacher and is parent advocate
    And she has deep knowledge of educational needs
    When municipal school policy is debated
    Then Sarah's professional and parent care work should be recognized
    And her advocacy should be informed by care economy data
    And school policy should reflect actual parent and educator experiences
    And care economy should strengthen parent voice in education policy
    And municipal education should benefit from care worker input

  Scenario: Municipal food security programs integrate with care economy
    Given municipal food assistance programs exist
    And many residents participate in care economy food cooperatives
    When municipal food security is addressed
    Then the municipal_elohim should coordinate with existing programs
    And care economy food cooperatives should receive municipal support
    And care tokens should integrate with food assistance
    And municipal food policy should recognize cooperative models
    And care economy should enhance, not replace, public food security

  Scenario: Municipal care token supplements support low-income families
    Given Sarah's household income is $65k/year
    And many families have less economic resources
    When municipal care economy operates
    Then care token supplements should be available based on income
    And the Value Scanner should be accessible regardless of ability to pay
    And municipal subsidies should ensure universal access
    And care economy should function as economic support system
    And access should be dignified and universal

  Scenario: Municipal working parent policies informed by care economy data
    Given Sarah balances full-time work with parenting
    And municipal policy affects working parents' capacity to care
    When municipal employment policies are considered
    Then care economy data should show working parents' time constraints
    And policy should recognize workers' care responsibilities
    And municipal employers should adopt family-friendly policies
    And Sarah's advocacy should be strengthened by care economy evidence
    And municipal policy should support work-life integration

  Scenario: Municipal resource allocation reflects care economy contributions
    Given Sarah and others contribute substantially to community care
    And municipal budgets allocate significant resources
    When municipal budgets are decided
    Then care economy contributions should be visible to decision makers
    And resource allocation should recognize care creates value
    And neighborhoods with strong care economy should receive support
    And municipal investment should strengthen care economy infrastructure
    And budgets should reflect that care work is economically valuable

  Scenario: Municipal crisis response coordinates with care economy networks
    Given municipal emergency management systems exist
    And care economy has created mutual aid networks
    When municipal crises occur (natural disasters, economic shocks, health emergencies)
    Then the municipal_elohim should coordinate with emergency response
    And existing care networks should be activated for crisis support
    And municipal response should leverage community care capacity
    And care economy should strengthen municipal resilience
    And crisis response should be more effective through coordination

  Scenario: Municipal data privacy protects residents while enabling planning
    Given municipal care economy involves data about many residents
    And privacy must be rigorously protected
    When municipal planning uses care economy data
    Then the municipal_elohim should only provide aggregated anonymized data
    And no individual household should be identifiable
    And Sarah's privacy should be absolute unless she chooses disclosure
    And municipal benefits should not require privacy sacrifice
    And data governance should be transparent and accountable

  Scenario: Municipal care economy connects to regional and state levels
    Given Sarah's municipality successfully implements care economy
    And larger governance scales could benefit from similar approaches
    When municipal care economy is established
    Then the municipal_elohim should connect to regional systems
    And successful municipal practices should inform state policy
    And care economy should scale beyond municipal boundaries
    And Sarah's local success should contribute to broader transformation
    And municipal level should be stepping stone to larger scale change

  Scenario: Municipal civic engagement increased through care economy participation
    Given Sarah participates actively in municipal care economy
    And civic engagement is strengthened by care work recognition
    When municipal civic participation is measured
    Then care economy participants should show higher engagement
    And Sarah's care work should connect her to civic processes
    And municipal democracy should be strengthened by care economy
    And voter participation should increase among care economy members
    And care creates civic engagement, not just economic value

  Scenario: Municipal economic development includes care economy
    Given traditional economic development ignores care work
    And Sarah's care contributions create substantial value
    When municipal economic development is planned
    Then care economy should be recognized as economic sector
    And care work should be counted in municipal GDP calculations
    And economic development should support care economy infrastructure
    And municipal prosperity should reflect care creates value
    And economic planning should include invisible care labor

  Scenario: Municipal policy experimentation enabled by care economy data
    Given Sarah's municipality has care economy data unavailable elsewhere
    And this data enables evidence-based policy innovation
    When municipal government considers new policies
    Then care economy data should enable experimentation
    And policy innovations should be tested with evidence
    And Sarah's municipality should lead in care economy policy
    And successful experiments should be shared with other municipalities
    And care economy should drive progressive municipal governance
