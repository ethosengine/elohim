Feature: Educational Layer Value Literacy for Adult
  As an adult educator and parent
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to teach value literacy to the next generation
  So that children grow up understanding care creates value

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the adult user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah works as a teacher professionally
    And Sarah is mother to Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And the educational governance context is active
    And the educational_elohim coordinates value literacy education
    And Sarah operates as both professional educator and parent educator

  Scenario: Professional teaching work recognized as care labor
    Given Sarah works full-time as a teacher
    And education is one of society's most important care functions
    When Sarah's professional work is tracked in care economy
    Then teaching should be recognized as care labor
    And the educational_elohim should quantify Sarah's care contributions to students
    And professional education should be valued alongside household care
    And Sarah should see her career as care work, not separate from care economy
    And teaching should be explicitly valued as caring for next generation

  Scenario: Teaching value literacy to own children through Value Scanner
    Given Sarah is raising Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And she wants them to learn care economy principles
    When Sarah uses the Value Scanner with her children
    Then she should model value literacy through her actions
    And Tommy should learn at developmentally appropriate level (wonder-preservation)
    And Emma should learn at her developmental stage (guided autonomy)
    And the educational_elohim should support Sarah's teaching
    And children should internalize care creates value through family practice

  Scenario: Integrating care economy principles into classroom teaching
    Given Sarah teaches in a traditional school system
    And she wants to bring care economy into curriculum
    When Sarah designs lessons for her students
    Then the educational_elohim should provide age-appropriate resources
    And she should teach that care work creates value
    And students should learn through concrete experiences
    And classroom should become care economy learning environment
    And Sarah should spread care economy principles to hundreds of children

  Scenario: Educational policy shaped by teacher care work advocacy
    Given Sarah has deep knowledge of educational needs from professional experience
    And education policy affects her capacity to care for students
    When educational policy decisions are made
    Then Sarah's care contributions should give her voice
    And teacher advocacy should be strengthened by care economy data
    And policy should reflect actual educator experiences
    And care economy should empower teacher voice in education governance
    And those who do care work should shape care work policy

  Scenario: Preventing teacher burnout through care economy recognition
    Given Sarah faces high burnout risk as teacher
    And teacher care work is undervalued and underpaid
    When the educational_elohim tracks Sarah's teaching labor
    Then her care contributions should be quantified and visible
    And she should gain language to advocate for fair compensation
    And recognition should support her professional sustainability
    And care economy should help prevent teacher burnout
    And visibility should enable Sarah to maintain teaching career

  Scenario: Adult learning about care economy through practice and reflection
    Given Sarah is learning care economy principles while teaching them
    And adult learning happens through experience and reflection
    When Sarah uses the Value Scanner over time
    Then she should deepen her own value literacy continuously
    And the educational_elohim should support her learning journey
    And she should gain insights from teaching children
    And her understanding should evolve through practice
    And adults should learn care economy alongside children

  Scenario: Educational resources for parents teaching value literacy
    Given Sarah wants to teach value literacy effectively
    And she needs pedagogical support for home education
    When Sarah accesses educational resources
    Then the educational_elohim should provide parent education materials
    And resources should be developmentally appropriate for different ages
    And guidance should help Sarah teach Tommy differently than Emma
    And Sarah should have tools to be effective value literacy educator
    And parent education should be supported systematically

  Scenario: Multigenerational value literacy education within families
    Given Sarah is teaching her children
    And she's learning from her parents' care wisdom
    And multiple generations participate in value education
    When family engages in value literacy learning
    Then the educational_elohim should coordinate across generations
    And grandparents' care knowledge should be honored
    And parents should teach children while still learning themselves
    And value literacy should be transmitted across generations
    And family should be primary educational site for care economy

  Scenario: Educational assessment measures value literacy development
    Given Sarah wants to know if children are learning value literacy
    And assessment can support or undermine learning
    When children's value literacy is assessed
    Then the educational_elohim should measure care-based decision making
    And assessment should observe whether children see care as valuable
    And it should track development of care economy principles
    And assessment should support learning, not create anxiety
    And Sarah should see children's value literacy growth over time

  Scenario: Professional development for educators in care economy teaching
    Given Sarah wants to bring care economy into classroom
    And she needs professional development support
    When Sarah seeks educator training
    Then the educational_elohim should provide professional development
    And training should help teachers integrate care economy into curriculum
    And it should respect existing teaching expertise
    And it should provide practical classroom strategies
    And Sarah should be equipped to teach care economy effectively

  Scenario: Educational materials culturally responsive to diverse families
    Given Sarah teaches students from diverse cultural backgrounds
    And her own children are learning family cultural values
    When educational materials are designed
    Then the educational_elohim should provide culturally diverse resources
    And materials should respect different care economy traditions
    And Sarah should be able to adapt to cultural contexts
    And value literacy should be taught in culturally responsive ways
    And diverse approaches to care should be honored in education

  Scenario: Educational governance includes parent and teacher voices
    Given Sarah is both parent and teacher
    And educational governance affects her professionally and personally
    When educational policy decisions are made
    Then Sarah should have voice from both perspectives
    And parent care contributions should influence school policy
    And teacher care contributions should shape education governance
    And educational democracy should include those who do education care work
    And Sarah's dual perspective should be valued in governance

  Scenario: Next generation grows up assuming care economy is normal
    Given Sarah is teaching value literacy to many children
    And children form baseline expectations from early experience
    When children who learn care economy reach adulthood
    Then they should assume care work creates value
    And they should expect care to be visible and recognized
    And they should see care economy as normal, not alternative
    And Sarah's teaching should transform next generation's economic understanding
    And cultural transformation should happen through education
