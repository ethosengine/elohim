Feature: Love-Centered Platform Architecture
  As the Elohim Protocol
  I want to provide distributed infrastructure that prioritizes human flourishing
  So that users escape extractive surveillance capitalism

  Background:
    Given the platform uses distributed architecture
    And user data is sovereign and portable

  Scenario: User data sovereignty
    Given a user joins the Elohim platform
    When they create content and connections
    Then their data remains under their control
    And they can export their data at any time
    And they can delete their data permanently

  Scenario: Platform values alignment
    Given the platform operates on love-centered principles
    When a feature is proposed for implementation
    Then it must pass the human flourishing test
    And it cannot rely on surveillance capitalism
    And it must respect diverse community values

  Scenario: Distributed infrastructure resilience
    Given the platform uses distributed nodes
    When a single node fails or is compromised
    Then other nodes continue serving users
    And no central authority can censor content
    And communities maintain autonomous governance

  Scenario: Escaping platform lock-in
    Given a user has years of content on the platform
    When they decide to migrate to another service
    Then they can export their complete social graph
    And all their content in open formats
    And their identity remains portable
    And their relationships are preserved
