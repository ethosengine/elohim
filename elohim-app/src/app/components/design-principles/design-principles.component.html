      <div class="card">
        <h3>Peer-to-Peer Architecture</h3>
        <p>Distributed infrastructure like Holochain removes single points of failure and control. Edge computing enables community sovereignty and hyper-local governance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Graduated Intimacy</h3>
        <p>Spaces for personal exploration exist alongside protected commons. Consent boundaries prevent individual extremes from corrupting shared spaces.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Transparency as Immune System</h3>
        <p>Open governance makes manipulation visible. Behavioral pattern recognition identifies corruption while preserving privacy and dignity.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Community Wisdom at Scale</h3>
        <p>Distributed governance systems where local communities steward their own spaces while maintaining connection to broader networks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Economic Alignment</h3>
        <p>Systems that don't financially reward antisocial behavior. Cooperative ownership structures that support rather than exploit human connection.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Incorruptible Stewardship</h3>
        <p>AI agents that cannot be captured by institutional power, trained on love rather than profit, serving as anonymous guardians of human flourishing.</p>
