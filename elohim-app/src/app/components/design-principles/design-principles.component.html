      <div class="card">
        <h3>Peer-to-Peer Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Distributed infrastructure like Holochain removes single points of failure and control.
          Edge computing enables community sovereignty and hyper-local governance.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Graduated Intimacy</h3>
        <p>
          Spaces for personal exploration exist alongside protected commons. Consent boundaries
          prevent individual extremes from corrupting shared spaces.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Transparency as Immune System</h3>
        <p>
          Open governance makes manipulation visible. Behavioral pattern recognition identifies
          corruption while preserving privacy and dignity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Community Wisdom at Scale</h3>
        <p>
          Distributed governance systems where local communities steward their own spaces while
          maintaining connection to broader networks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Economic Alignment</h3>
        <p>
          Systems that don't financially reward antisocial behavior. Cooperative ownership
          structures that support rather than exploit human connection.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Incorruptible Stewardship</h3>
        <p>
          AI agents that cannot be captured by institutional power, trained on love rather than
          profit, serving as anonymous guardians of human flourishing.
