      <h3>Love as Technology</h3>
      <p>The radical proposition at the heart of this protocol is that love—not as sentiment but as committed action toward mutual flourishing—can be encoded into technological systems. Not through rules about love, but through architectures that make exploitation structurally impossible while making care structurally supported.</p>
      
      <p>As AI development accelerates, the technical hurdles of building distributed, love-aligned systems are dropping rapidly. The infrastructure we build today will shape human consciousness for generations.</p>
      
      <p><strong>We can accept digital feudalism, or we can create digital democracy.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>We can encode exploitation, or we can encode love.</strong></p>
      
      <p style="margin: 2rem 0;">This requires courage to reject profitable but harmful models, wisdom to learn from ancient and modern traditions, patience to build infrastructure that may take decades to mature, and hope that humans can transcend current limitations.</p>
