    <h2>The Architectural Crisis</h2>
    <p>We stand at a crossroads in the evolution of digital civilization. Our current crisis stems not from bad intentions but from fundamental architectural constraints that span our economic, political, and digital systems:</p>

    <h3>Economic Architecture: The Poverty of Currency</h3>
    <p>In light of modern computation, our currencies are astonishingly primitive. They:</p>
    <div class="vision-grid">
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Carry no values</strong> - A dollar spent on weapons is identical to one spent on medicine
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Have no natural limits</strong> - Creating systemic growth imperatives that destroy ecosystems
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Fail to reward care</strong> - A mother's love, a teacher's dedication generate no currency
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Concentrate rather than circulate</strong> - Exponential returns to capital while linear returns to labor
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Collective Intelligence Architecture: Crashing Dated Institutions</h3>
    <p>Our systems for collective decision-making are equally outdated when exponential technology is pointed at us to exploit our vulnerabilities:</p>
    <div class="vision-grid">
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Votes are binary and infrequent</strong> - Complex preferences compressed into yes/no choices every few years
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Representation is geographic</strong> - In an age where communities are increasingly digital and interest-based
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Feedback loops are broken</strong> - Politicians can safely ignore public preferences between elections
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Complexity exceeds human processing</strong> - Bills thousands of pages long that no single person understands
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Digital Architecture: The Financial Extraction of Attention</h3>
    <div class="vision-grid">
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Centralized control</strong> creates single points of failure, censorship, and capture
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Engagement optimization</strong> weaponizes human psychology, addicting us to outrage and validation
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>One-size-fits-all moderation</strong> fails to respect diverse community values and contexts
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Surveillance capitalism</strong> turns human connection into extractive data mining operations
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Yet we have proof that humans can build high-trust, pro-social systems even at nation-state scale, as demonstrated by Scandinavian social democracies. The problem isn't human nature—it's that we've built systems that amplify our worst tendencies while suppressing our capacity for cooperation.</p>
