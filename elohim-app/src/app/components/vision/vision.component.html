    <h2>The Vision Realized</h2>
    <p>Imagine a digital world where technology serves love rather than engagement metrics—not sentimental love, but committed action toward mutual flourishing. This infrastructure would be built on wisdom learned from both ancient traditions and modern innovations, encoding the insights of Scandinavian democracy and indigenous stewardship into distributed architecture.</p>

      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Technology serves love</strong> rather than engagement metrics or surveillance capitalism
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Communities self-govern</strong> without corporate oversight, using transparent, locally-owned infrastructure
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Vulnerable people are protected</strong> by systems that cannot be corrupted or captured by institutional power
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Human creativity flourishes</strong> without algorithmic manipulation or artificial scarcity
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Different values coexist</strong> without forcing conformity through graduated intimacy and consent boundaries
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Dark patterns are impossible</strong> because the architecture doesn't allow exploitation by design
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Connection is genuine</strong> rather than performative, fostering real relationships and mutual aid
      </div>
      <div class="vision-item">
        <strong>Growth is encouraged</strong> while exploitation is prevented through economic structures that reward cooperation
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This is not utopian thinking—it's engineering with wisdom. Just as we've built physical infrastructure that supports human life (water systems, power grids, transportation networks), we can build digital infrastructure that supports human flourishing.</p>
