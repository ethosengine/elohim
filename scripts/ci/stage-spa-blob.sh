# PATCH it onto its content row. Extracted verbatim from the Jenkinsfile's
# stageSpaBlobs helper (2026-06-10) when the inline heredoc pushed the CPS
# method past the JVM 64KB MethodTooLargeException limit — the bash lives
# here, the Jenkinsfile keeps a one-line call. See Jenkinsfile
# "STAGE HELPER METHODS" for the pillar-EPR decomposition rationale.

# One PUT + (optional) PATCH+verify attempt. Returns non-zero on ANY failure

#
# 1. Upload ZIP as blob via doorway's seed-blob route.
#    Why /admin/seed/blob and not /blob/{hash}: doorway's forward_blob_to_storage
#    (storage_proxy.rs) is a read-through cache that hardcodes client.get() — PUT
#    requests get silently downgraded to GET, storage returns 404 on the
#    not-yet-uploaded hash, the build fails with curl exit 22. /admin/seed/blob
#    is the seeder's write-through path (preserves dev fix f853fb665).
#
#    AUTH (2026-06-27): doorway's require_seed_authority gate (commit 396779747,
#    2026-06-11) 401s an UNAUTHENTICATED PUT on any non-DEV_MODE doorway. alpha
#    (doorway-A) sets DEV_MODE=true and bypassed the gate, masking the omission;
#    elohim.host (doorway-B / alpha-b) does NOT set DEV_MODE, so its PUT 401'd
#    EVERY build → blob never uploaded → host silently stranded on a stale bundle
#    for ~2 weeks (the per-host deploy-lag class). The PATCH already sent the
#    admin key; the PUT was simply never updated when the gate landed. Send the
#    SAME admin X-API-Key here — seed.rs: "Admin API key (X-API-Key) also passes
#    — the operator credential CI uses." DEV_MODE hosts ignore it; gated hosts
#    require it. ${VAR:-} keeps it set -u-safe when no admin key is in scope (the
#    no-credential PUT then correctly stays unauthorized on a gated host).
# 2. Link blob to the content row (PATCH+verify) — only when admin key present.
#    Seatbelt: after each PATCH, GET the row and assert the hash field matches
#    the SHA just written; a drift returns non-zero (→ retried, then NAMED).
