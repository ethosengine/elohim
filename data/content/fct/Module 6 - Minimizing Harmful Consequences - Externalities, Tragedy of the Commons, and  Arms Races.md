### Foundations of Christians and Technology Learning Objectives

 Reflect on how the concept of externalities relates to Christian stewardship and care for God's creation.  
 Consider how technology's impacts align with or diverge from Jesus's teachings on loving one's neighbor and caring for the marginalized.  
 Integrate Christian ethical frameworks and principles of discernment when assessing potential externalities.  
 Examine how regenerative systems align with biblical concepts of restoration and renewal.  
 Cultivate a prophetic mindset that anticipates potential harms, inspired by biblical examples of foresight and warning.  
 Reflect on biblical teachings about responsible growth and collaborative community to inform technological development.  
 Consider how these practices align with Christian principles of self-examination and accountability.  
 Incorporate prayer and spiritual discernment alongside analytical tools when considering technological impacts.  
 Relate this approach to Christian concepts of patience, long-suffering, and trust in God's timing.  
 Explore how technology can be developed to promote Christian values of justice, equality, and human dignity in society.

### Introduction

When a company becomes wildly profitable it often does so by moving out of balance:  
\-towards extraction and away from stewardship  
\-towards efficiency and away from resilience  
\-towards competition and away from collaboration

Humane technologists understand how to find a balance: how to embrace efficiency and growth in places where powerful forms of value can be created, and to embrace stewardship and collaboration when powerful forms of value are at risk of being destroyed.

### Bible Reference(s)

The Cost of Discipleship

25Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them, 26“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. 27Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. 28For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? 29Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, 30saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’ 31Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? 32And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace. 33So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.  

Stewardship and care for creation:  
Genesis 2:15 \- "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."  
Loving neighbors and caring for the marginalized:  
Matthew 22:39 \- "And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"  
Ethical frameworks and discernment:  
Philippians 1:9-10 \- "And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best..."  
Regenerative systems and restoration:  
Revelation 21:5 \- "He who was seated on the throne said, 'I am making everything new\!'"  
Prophetic mindset and foresight:  
Amos 3:7 \- "Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets."  
Responsible growth and collaborative community:  
1 Corinthians 3:6-9 \- "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow..."  
Self-examination and accountability:  
Galatians 6:4-5 \- "Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else..."  
Prayer and spiritual discernment:  
James 1:5 \- "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you."  
Patience and trust in God's timing:  
2 Peter 3:8-9 \- "But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day..."  
Promoting justice, equality, and human dignity:  
Micah 6:8 \- "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."

### Story 

The story of Joseph interpreting Pharaoh's dreams and managing Egypt's resources in Genesis 41-47 provides an example of Minimizing Harmful Consequences in the bible:

"Joseph and the Seven Years of Plenty and Famine"  
In this story:  
Pharaoh has dreams of seven fat cows being eaten by seven thin cows, and seven healthy ears of grain being devoured by seven thin ears.  
Joseph interprets these dreams as a prediction of seven years of abundance followed by seven years of severe famine.  
Joseph advises Pharaoh to appoint a wise manager to oversee the collection and storage of surplus grain during the seven years of plenty.  
During the abundant years, Joseph implements a system to collect and store one-fifth of the harvest.  
When the famine hits, Egypt is prepared and can provide for its people and even sell grain to neighboring regions.

This narrative illustrates:  
Externalities: The future famine is an external factor that would have devastating consequences if not addressed.  
Tragedy of the Commons: Without Joseph's intervention, people might have consumed all the abundant crops, leaving nothing for the lean years \- similar to overfishing a lake.  
Arms Race: While not explicitly an arms race, the story shows how preparation and wise resource management can prevent a destructive competition for scarce resources during the famine.  
Stewardship: Joseph's management demonstrates responsible stewardship of resources, considering long-term consequences and the common good.  
Proactive Problem-Solving: The story emphasizes the importance of recognizing potential future problems and taking action to mitigate them.

This biblical narrative can be used to discuss how foresight, wise management, and consideration of long-term consequences are crucial in technology development and use. It also demonstrates how addressing potential "tragedies of the commons" can benefit not just one group, but surrounding communities as well.

### Conclusion

As we conclude this first part of our exploration into minimizing harmful consequences, we're reminded of Joseph's wisdom in ancient Egypt. Like Joseph, we're called to be stewards who anticipate future challenges and act responsibly with the resources and technologies at our disposal.  
We've learned that externalities \- the hidden costs of our actions \- can accumulate to create large-scale problems in our interconnected world. As followers of Christ, we're challenged to look beyond immediate profits or conveniences to consider the long-term impacts of our technological choices on our neighbors, communities, and God's creation.  
The story of Joseph teaches us that responsible stewardship often requires us to go against the grain of prevailing practices. In our context, this may mean resisting the temptation to extract and consume resources unsustainably, or to prioritize efficiency and competition at the expense of resilience and collaboration.  
As we move forward, let's commit to:

Cultivating a prophetic mindset that anticipates potential harms  
Integrating Christian ethical frameworks in our assessment of technological impacts  
Striving for regenerative systems that align with God's vision of renewal and restoration  
Balancing growth with stewardship, efficiency with resilience, and competition with collaboration

Remember, our goal isn't just to avoid harm, but to actively promote flourishing \- for individuals, communities, and creation as a whole. This aligns with Jesus' promise in John 10:10 that He came that we "may have life, and have it abundantly."  
Let's pray for wisdom as we navigate these complex issues, always seeking to align our technological practices with God's will. May we be salt and light in the tech industry, championing approaches that respect human dignity, promote justice, and care for God's creation.  
In our next session, we'll explore practical tools and strategies for implementing these principles. Until then, let's reflect on how we can be better stewards of the technologies in our own lives and spheres of influence. Amen.

### Application 

\* We must see ourselves as Christans in a universal sense, if we are growing because other smaller congregations aren't as resourced are as capable as we are, or poaching from other christian communities, does not count toward growth as a body.   
\--As such, we should develop some ministry which seeks the development and success of other communities of christians, what we do well MUST be shared with the body, the full body, of Christ.  
\-- Church planting, building campaings, or relocating in such a way which chases and subsists primarly from our culture of suburban development needs to stop.   

\* We need to minimize the operational burdens of all "infrastructure" where we can, large buildings, debt-servicing, huge energy bills, transportation, health-care cost, risk-transfer.

\* We need a positive model for political discernment of the body which is judged by real measurable outcomes not lipservice to stated goals, we cannot be a community which serves the poor, prisoners, immigrants, orphans, and widows, while voting for a political representatives who impoverish, imprison, criminalize, orphan, and widow.  ( We cannot continue sinning, \[or advocate for consequences\], so that grace may abound )

\* Our lives must reflect our identity as christians,   
\--if we-members are working in industry that is generating externalities, we could dedicate capacity to helping people re-align their vocation with those values, without penalty or disruption.   
\--if we-members are living in such a way that is generating externalities (Parable of the Polygons), we should encourage people to make active choices and not rely on passive hope that someone will happen upon what a life well lived looks like.

"Jesus Camp" (2006), This documentary follows evangelical Christian children at a summer camp.  
Externality: Diminished capacity for empathy and understanding towards those with different beliefs.  
This externality impacts Christians and the church by:  
Limiting the ability to "love your neighbor as yourself" (Mark 12:31) when the "neighbor" holds different beliefs. Reducing the effectiveness of Christian witness by creating barriers to meaningful dialogue with non-believers. Potentially fostering a judgmental attitude that contradicts Jesus' teachings on love and acceptance. This externality hinders the church's ability to embody Christ's unconditional love by creating an "us vs. them" mentality, rather than seeing all people as equally worthy of God's love and grace.

"Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets" (2023): This docuseries about the Duggar family and their involvement with the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP) also highlights several externalities:  
Abuse and trauma: The series exposes how the teachings of IBLP created an environment where abuse could occur and be hidden, creating significant negative externalities for victims.  
This externality impacts Christians and the church by:  
Making it more difficult for genuine, loving Christian communities to reach those hurt by religious abuse.  
Potentially causing some to reject faith altogether, limiting opportunities for sharing Christ's love.  
Creating a barrier for the church to be seen as a place of healing and unconditional acceptance, as Jesus exemplified.  
This externality challenges the church's ability to be a reflection of Christ's unconditional love by associating Christianity with control and abuse rather than freedom and grace, contradicting Jesus' words in John 8:36, "So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."  
In both cases, these externalities demonstrate how certain practices within Christian communities can unintentionally create obstacles to living out and sharing the unconditional love of Christ. They highlight the importance of constantly examining our methods and motivations against the standard of Jesus' life and teachings, ensuring that our actions produce fruit that aligns with God's love for all people.
