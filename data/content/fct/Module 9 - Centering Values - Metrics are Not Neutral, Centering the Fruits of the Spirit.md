### Foundations of Christians and Technology Learning Objectives

Part 2: Centering the Fruits of the Spirit

Explore the Fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) as a metric for discerning the value and impact of technology on individuals and communities, in light of Jesus' teaching that "a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit" (Matthew 7:18).  
Analyze how technology can be designed to foster and support the growth of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control in users.  
Develop criteria for evaluating technologies based on their ability to produce or hinder the Fruits of the Spirit in users' lives and communities, using Jesus' tree and fruit analogy as a framework for discernment.  
Examine current tech industry and church practices through the lens of the Fruits of the Spirit, identifying areas where current approaches may be undermining spiritual growth or producing "bad fruit."  
Create strategies for implementing design principles that promote the Fruits of the Spirit in technology development and use, considering impact on individual spiritual formation, community relationships, and societal well-being.  
Discuss how the Fruits of the Spirit and Jesus' tree analogy can inform a Christian approach to data collection, user privacy, and algorithmic decision-making, critiquing current practices in both secular and religious contexts.  
Explore how focusing on the Fruits of the Spirit can help Christians navigate the limitations of quantitative metrics and avoid the pitfalls of Goodhart's Law in both tech development and church practices.  
Develop a framework for ongoing discernment in technology use and development, based on Jesus' teaching that "by their fruit you will recognize them" (Matthew 7:16), encouraging regular evaluation of the outcomes of our technological choices.

These revised objectives now incorporate Jesus' teaching about good and bad trees and their fruit, emphasizing the importance of discernment and evaluation based on outcomes rather than intentions or surface-level metrics.

A safe choice is centering on metrics that reduce KNOWN harm, start with the low hanging fruit, ready for harvest. 

### Introduction

Modern technology companies rely heavily on easily quantifiable metrics to drive decision-making, often optimized through A/B testing.  
Metrics like revenue, daily active users, or time spent are often essential for managing massive systems with hundreds of thousands to billions of data points. Quantification enables efficient decision-making that appears rigorous and objective. Metrics and A/B tests summarize vast amounts of data, providing comfort in what appears to be an ever more empirical picture of the user and their choices.  
Metrics certainly make decision-making and product development more efficient, but just as you explored in the previous module, this efficiency can create, amplify, and mask harms.  
As an app or service starts up, it seems “obvious” that optimizing for core metrics is a good thing. It’s exciting when daily active users go from 10 to 100 to 1,000. But as we optimize for metrics, we can lose sight of the original values the metrics were meant to support. When daily active users go from 1,000 to 1,000,000, it is increasingly difficult to know if users have an experience that aligns with our original intentions. That’s especially true when new users live with very different conditions from our own. The bigger the system that’s run on a handful of metrics, the easier it is to be out of touch with harms happening underneath:  
Growth in GDP might mean more addicted citizens  
Growth in patients treated might mean more sick people  
Growth in engagement might mean more anxious, distracted teenagers

While metrics are useful for managing scale, their quantitative objectivity is often confused for ethical neutrality. In reality, metrics have deep impact on the behavior of social systems—and not always in desirable ways:

### Bible Reference(s)

Paul's wrote optimistically for the Church in Corinth. 

Matthew 7:15-19 “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. 16 By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 17 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.

James 1:27 ASV  
27 Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.

### Story 

Sheila Gregoire, a passionate advocate for healthy Christian marriages, embarked on a groundbreaking journey that led to the writing of her book, "The Great Sex Rescue." Sheila, a regular contributor to Focus on the Family, was deeply troubled after reading "Love & Respect" and seeing dozens of comments from women on their website decrying the book for enabling abuse in their marriages. Driven by her concern, Sheila sent a detailed letter along with a meta-analysis of the comments to Focus on the Family, encouraging them to respond to their own feedback and stop promoting the book. However, Focus on the Family ignored her plea, which inspired Sheila to embark on a comprehensive survey and project to uncover the truth.

Sheila conducted a survey of over 20,000 Christian women, delving into their marital and sexual satisfaction. Her findings were illuminating and sometimes startling, revealing that certain widely taught beliefs were significantly harming women's marital happiness and sexual satisfaction. For instance, the belief that a wife is obligated to have sex to prevent her husband from straying was linked to lower sexual and marital satisfaction. Armed with this data, Sheila wrote "The Great Sex Rescue," where she not only presented her findings but also offered new frameworks for understanding and teaching about sex in marriage based on mutuality, respect, and true biblical principles.

Upon publishing her book, Focus on the Family responded by scrubbing Sheila's name from their website and any comment that mentioned her name. Despite this, new Focus on the Family contributors Julie Slattery and Gary Thomas adopted nearly word-for-word the message denouncing the most harmful obligation sex-message without acknowledging Sheila’s significant contribution. However, they continued to couch their findings in teachings that Sheila had exposed as harmful.

The story of Sheila Gregoire and her work aligns beautifully with the biblical wisdom of Matthew 7: "By their fruit you shall know them." In a world obsessed with metrics like profit, engagement, and growth, Sheila did something truly remarkable by championing "metrics that reduce known harm." Her focus on the actual well-being and satisfaction of women in marriages offers a powerful lesson in wisdom. Sheila’s work shows how true wisdom lies in seeking and measuring the presence of the fruits of the Spirit, as listed in Galatians 5: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. By putting in the work to measure these spiritual fruits, just as Sheila did, we can truly reap a harvest that leads to flourishing lives. This proves that the true measure of any teaching is found in the presence of these fruits in our lives.

### Discussion Question or Activity

Metrics and Benchmarks

"If we truly believe that 'by their fruit you will recognize them' (Matthew 7:16), how might we reimagine our measures of success and growth in the church to reflect the Fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)? Consider both personal spiritual development and communal church life in your response."  
This elevated version:

Grounds the question in scripture, reminding participants of the biblical basis for this approach.  
Directly references the Fruits of the Spirit, encouraging participants to consider each one (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control).  
Challenges the notion of "metrics" by using the more holistic term "measures of success and growth."  
Encourages participants to think beyond just church attendance or giving, which are often default metrics.  
Prompts consideration of both individual and community aspects of spiritual growth.  
Implicitly questions current church practices without being confrontational.  
Invites creative thinking about how abstract spiritual concepts might be practically observed or cultivated.

This reframed question should lead to a richer discussion about what truly matters in Christian life and how we might realign our focus and practices to nurture the Fruits of the Spirit in ourselves and our communities.

### Conclusion

Taking a humanely oriented, complex systems perspective requires us to be “epistemically humble” and to accept the inherent uncertainty of living in a world in which everything is subject to change:

Optimizing the parts doesn't always lead to optimization of the whole, especially in complex systems. As David Stroh wrote in Systems Thinking for Social Change:

“In order to optimize the performance of the entire system, people need to shift from trying to optimize their part of the system to improving relationships among its constituent parts.”

Here, the “whole” is how a technology impacts the user and their wider community. The “parts” are individual elements of the technology such as specific algorithms, features, and metrics. Technology teams must move in and out, from parts to whole and whole to parts, so that they can grow in their understanding of the technology's effect on individual users and communities.

This process is often under-appreciated and under-resourced. Ask yourself where you could investigate these types of relationships. This may entail expanding your role to be more cross-functional, or hiring a new person to take on that role. These types of jobs are not common, often because their contributions are not conveniently captured by simple metrics.

So let us reimagine measures of success based on the Fruits of the Spirit:

Love:  
Shift focus from attendance numbers to meaningful relationships formed.  
Measure the number of reconciliations facilitated within the church and community.  
Track instances of sacrificial giving and service to those in need.

Joy:  
Assess the church's impact on mental health in the community.  
Measure participation in community celebrations and cultural events.  
Survey members' sense of purpose and fulfillment in their faith journey.

Peace:  
Track resolution of conflicts within the church and wider community.  
Measure reduction in domestic violence rates in the church community.  
Assess the church's involvement in local peacemaking initiatives.

Patience:  
Evaluate long-term commitment to discipleship and spiritual growth programs.  
Measure retention and growth of new believers over time.  
Assess willingness to engage in long-term community development projects.

Kindness:  
Track acts of unexpected generosity by church members.  
Measure the church's welcome and support of marginalized groups.  
Assess the church's environmental stewardship efforts.

Goodness:  
Evaluate the church's impact on local crime rates and addiction recovery.  
Measure ethical business practices among church members.  
Track instances of members standing up against injustice.

Faithfulness:  
Assess depth of biblical knowledge and application among members.  
Measure long-term commitment to missions and community service.  
Evaluate integrity in personal and professional lives of members.

Gentleness:  
Measure the church's approach to disagreements and conflicts.  
Assess the tone and content of social media engagement by members.  
Evaluate the church's approach to discipline and correction.

Self-control:  
Assess members' media consumption habits and their impact.  
Measure responsible financial practices among members.  
Evaluate the church's use of resources and environmental impact.

### Application 

To implement these measures, the church might:  
Develop a "Fruit of the Spirit" assessment tool for individual and communal reflection.  
Create small groups focused on cultivating specific fruits.  
Implement a mentoring program pairing mature believers with newer ones.  
Redesign church programs to intentionally foster these fruits.  
Partner with local organizations to measure community impact.  
Use technology to facilitate connection, accountability, and growth in these areas.

This approach would require a significant shift from typical suburban church metrics, focusing on qualitative growth and community impact rather than numbers and budgets. It would challenge members to live out their faith more intentionally and holistically, addressing the externalities of their lifestyles and consumption habits. The result could be a church that truly embodies the Fruits of the Spirit, making a tangible difference in individual lives and the broader community.
