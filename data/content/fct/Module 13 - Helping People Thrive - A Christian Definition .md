### Introduction

Welcome to "Thriving in Christ's Abundance: A Christian Approach to Humane Technology." As we embark on this journey together, let us reflect on the words of Jesus in John 10:9-11:  
"I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."  
In this powerful passage, Jesus presents us with a striking contrast: the abundant life He offers versus the destruction that comes from other sources. As we navigate the complex landscape of modern technology, these words take on new significance.  
Our digital age presents unprecedented opportunities for connection, creativity, and the spread of the Gospel. Yet, it also poses unique challenges to our spiritual well-being, our relationships, and our ability to live out our faith authentically. Like the thief Jesus warns about, certain aspects of technology can steal our attention, kill our productivity, and destroy our sense of community and purpose.  
However, as followers of Christ, we are called not to retreat from these challenges, but to engage with them wisely and purposefully. Just as Jesus came to give us abundant life, we are tasked with cultivating this abundance in all aspects of our lives \- including our digital spaces.  
This course aims to equip you with the knowledge, skills, and spiritual discernment needed to thrive in the digital age while staying rooted in Christ. We will explore how to:

Recognize and resist the "thieves" of the digital world that threaten to diminish our lives  
Develop a Christ-centered approach to technology use and development  
Leverage digital tools to enhance rather than replace authentic Christian community  
Foster spiritual disciplines and growth in an age of constant distraction  
Design and use technology in ways that reflect God's love and promote human flourishing

As we journey through this course, let us keep in mind that our ultimate goal is not merely to use technology more effectively, but to use it in a way that aligns with God's purpose for our lives. We seek to enter through Christ, the true door, finding in Him the wisdom and guidance to navigate both digital and physical realms.  
May this course challenge us to critically examine our relationship with technology, inspire us to imagine new possibilities for Kingdom-oriented innovation, and ultimately lead us to a richer, more abundant life in Christ \- one that leverages the best of what technology has to offer while remaining firmly grounded in our faith.  
Let us begin this exploration with open hearts and minds, ready to be transformed by God's wisdom as we seek to be salt and light in the digital world.

### Story 

The story of Jesus feeding of the 5000, illustrates many of the principles we're aiming for in technology design, found in all four Gospels (Matthew 14:13-21, Mark 6:30-44, Luke 9:10-17, John 6:1-14). This story encapsulates several key design principles that align with both Christian values and humane technology:

Recognizing and Addressing Real Needs:  
Jesus saw the crowd's hunger and responded to their physical need, not just their spiritual one. This parallels our goal of creating technology that addresses genuine human needs rather than manufacturing artificial desires.  
Stewardship of Resources:  
Jesus used what was available (five loaves and two fish) and transformed it into abundance. This exemplifies efficient use of resources and sustainable design.  
Community and Sharing:  
The miracle involved everyone sharing and participating in the distribution. This mirrors our aim to create technology that fosters community and collaboration rather than isolation.  
Intentionality and Mindfulness:  
Jesus had the crowd sit down in groups, creating order and allowing for a more mindful experience of the meal. This reflects our goal of designing for intentional, focused use rather than mindless consumption.  
Abundance Without Excess:  
There was enough for everyone to be satisfied, but Jesus also instructed that the leftovers be gathered, avoiding waste. This balance of abundance without excess is a key principle for sustainable, ethical technology.  
Holistic Care:  
Jesus addressed both spiritual and physical needs, demonstrating care for the whole person. Our technology should similarly support holistic well-being, not just isolated aspects of human experience.

Christian Design Principles we're trying to elevate:

Servant-Hearted Design: Creating technology that serves human needs rather than exploiting human vulnerabilities.  
Stewardship: Developing sustainable technologies that use resources wisely and minimize harmful environmental impact.  
Community-Centric: Prioritizing features that build and strengthen real-world communities and relationships.  
Sabbath-Honoring: Incorporating rest and disconnection into the design, respecting human limits and the need for renewal.  
Truth-Promoting: Designing systems that elevate truth and combat misinformation, reflecting God's nature as the source of truth.  
Justice-Oriented: Creating inclusive technologies that consider the needs of all, especially the marginalized.  
Attention-Respecting: Treating human attention as sacred, designing to enhance focus rather than fragment it.  
Virtue-Fostering: Encouraging the development of Christian virtues (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, etc.) through technology use.  
Creation-Affirming: Leveraging technology to help users engage more deeply with the physical world and God's creation, not escape from it.  
Kingdom-Advancing: Aligning technological innovation with the values and goals of God's Kingdom, seeking to bring more of heaven to earth through our creations.

These principles, grounded in the story of Jesus feeding the 5000, provide a framework for developing technology that truly helps people thrive in a way that honors God and serves humanity.

### Discussion Question or Activity

Review Activity : EXAMINING FLAWED STORIES  
Technology companies often have compelling stories about how their products contribute to human thriving.   
Look at the following stereotypical stories. In what way are they authentic? In what ways do they mimic thriving in toxic ways?

“We value creators and want to create a place where they can show off their brilliance, grow their audience, and make real money.”   
          \-  Often used by products like TikTok  
​  
“We’re a place for fun, inspiration, and ideas that matter. We show people the most relevant content so that they can enjoy themselves and lead more informed and meaningful lives.”   
          – Often used by products like YouTube/Google​

“We help small business owners find customers who’ll love their products so that their businesses can grow and thrive.”   
          – Often used by products like Instagram​

Reflect on each of these examples. Note that some definitions of thriving you believe in may be tangled up in those stories.   
Then consider how a product you’ve worked on or use may seek to help people thrive. Does that product define thriving accurately?

REFLECTION: EXAMINING OUR CHURCH'S MISSION AND PRACTICES

Just as technology companies often have compelling stories about how their products contribute to human thriving, churches also have mission statements or creeds that describe their purpose and values. However, like tech companies, churches may sometimes drift from these ideals or unintentionally mask practices that don't align with their stated mission.  
Activity:

Find your church's mission statement or creed. If your church doesn't have one, consider the general mission of the Christian church as stated in Matthew 28:19-20 or Acts 1:8.  
Reflect on the following questions:  
a. What does your church's mission statement claim about how it contributes to human thriving or fulfills God's calling?  
b. In what ways is this mission statement authentically lived out in your church's practices?  
c. Are there ways in which your church's actual practices might mimic thriving in potentially harmful or misleading ways?  
Consider the following examples of church mission statements and practices. How might these statements potentially mask practices that don't align with their ideals?

Example 1: "We exist to reach the lost and make disciples of all nations."  
Potential misalignment: A church that focuses solely on overseas missions while neglecting local community needs.  
Example 2: "Our mission is to love God, love others, and serve the world."  
Potential misalignment: A church that emphasizes feel-good experiences in worship but doesn't actively engage in serving the local community or addressing social justice issues.  
Example 3: "We are a welcoming community where all can experience God's love."  
Potential misalignment: A church that claims to be welcoming but has unspoken cultural or socioeconomic barriers that make certain groups feel unwelcome or excluded.

Reflect on these questions:  
a. How might your church's practices sometimes drift from its stated mission?  
b. Are there any "metrics" your church uses to measure success (e.g., attendance, donations) that might inadvertently lead to practices that don't align with its core mission?  
c. How can your church better align its practices with its stated mission and with biblical principles of thriving?  
Consider how technology use in your church might be supporting or hindering the authentic fulfillment of its mission. Are there ways technology is being used that might mimic spiritual growth or community building without actually fostering deep, transformative experiences?

This activity aims to encourage honest, thoughtful reflection on how our churches, like tech companies, can sometimes drift from their core mission or unintentionally adopt practices that don't truly foster thriving as defined by Christ. By examining these potential misalignments, we can work towards creating church communities and using technologies in ways that genuinely support spiritual growth, authentic community, and Christ-centered thriving.

### Conclusion

 Integrating Christian Principles with Humane Technology Design  
As we conclude this module on helping people thrive, let's reflect on how we can integrate the design principles of humane technology with our Christian understanding of abundant life in Christ.

Protecting Sacred Attention:  
In John 10:27, Jesus says, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me." As Christians, our primary attention should be focused on hearing and following Christ's voice. Technology should support, not hinder, this divine connection. By designing technology that respects attention as a sacred resource, we honor God's call on our lives and protect our ability to discern His will. This aligns with the humane technology principle of protecting attention, recognizing it as fundamental to our agency and thriving.

Designing for God-Centered Intentionality:  
Proverbs 16:9 reminds us, "The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps." As we design for intentionality, we must recognize that true thriving comes from aligning our intentions with God's purposes. Technology should support users in reflecting on their goals, understanding themselves in light of God's word, and acting with purpose. This approach combines the humane technology principle of designing for intentionality with a Christian understanding of purposeful living.

Cultivating Deeply Valuable Experiences in Christ:  
Jesus promises in John 15:11, "These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full." The deeply valuable experiences we design for should ultimately lead people towards the fullness of joy found in Christ. While technology can provide stimulating experiences, true thriving comes from experiences that deepen our relationship with God and others, foster spiritual growth, and contribute to God's kingdom. This aligns with the principle of designing for deeply valuable experiences, but with a Christian focus on eternal value.

As we apply these principles, we must be vigilant about the potential for addiction and false promises of meaning. Just as Paul warns in Colossians 2:8, "See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ," we must ensure our technologies don't captivate users with empty promises of fulfillment apart from Christ.

### Application

Personal Lifestyle Audit: Develop a tool for individuals to assess how their daily choices (consumption, housing, transportation, etc.) impact their attention, intentionality, and the quality of their experiences.  
"Sacred Attention" Challenge: Create a 30-day program that guides individuals to reclaim their attention through practices like digital fasting, contemplative prayer, and mindful technology use.  
Digital Footprint Evaluation: Provide a framework for Christians to critically evaluate their online behavior and digital consumption habits in light of their faith values.  
Ethical Stewardship Course: Develop a course on managing personal finances and resources in ways that prioritize deeply valuable experiences over consumerism.  
Community Impact Assessment: Guide individuals in mapping their sphere of influence and identifying opportunities to foster intentional, meaningful relationships in their neighborhoods and workplaces.

For Church Leaders and Developers:  
Holistic Church Audit: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of church activities, assessing how they align with the principles of protecting attention, fostering intentionality, and creating deeply valuable experiences.  
Redefining Success Metrics: Move away from attendance and giving as primary success indicators. Develop new metrics that measure growth in community relationships, spiritual formation, and local community impact.  
Intentional Gathering Design: Reimagine church gatherings to prioritize deep, meaningful interactions over passive consumption of religious content.  
Digital Discipleship Framework: Create guidelines for using digital tools to enhance, not replace, face-to-face discipleship and community building.  
"Less is More" Ministry Model: Develop a church model that emphasizes quality of engagement over quantity of programs, allowing more time and space for reflection and intentional living.  
Neighborhood Engagement Strategy: Design initiatives that embed the church deeply in local community life, fostering relationships and addressing real needs.  
Intergenerational Wisdom Exchange: Create programs that facilitate the sharing of life experiences and spiritual insights across generations.  
Collective Resource Stewardship: Implement systems for shared resources within the church community (e.g., tool libraries, carpooling networks, skill exchanges) to promote simplicity and interdependence.  
Digital Commons Development: Build a church-specific digital platform that facilitates community coordination, resource sharing, and collective decision-making while respecting attention and fostering intentionality.  
"Slow Church" Movement: Promote a church culture that values depth over speed, quality over quantity, and process over immediate results.

Priorities for Implementation:  
Education and Awareness: Prioritize helping individuals and churches understand the impact of technology on attention, intentionality, and the quality of our experiences.  
Embodied Practices: Focus on developing habits and rituals that bring abstract principles into concrete, lived experience.  
Systemic Thinking: Encourage a shift from individual-focused solutions to community-wide transformations.  
Relationship-Centric Design: Ensure all technological implementations prioritize the strengthening of real-world relationships.  
Simplicity and Depth: Promote a "less but better" approach in both personal life and church programming.
