Feature: National-Level Policy Making for AI Governance
  As a policy_maker in the governance system
  Operating at the nation_state governance layer
  I want to establish national framework for democratic AI governance
  So that protocol can flourish while integrating with national law and institutions

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the policy_maker user is registered in the system
    And the nation_state governance context is active
    And Senator Elena Ruiz works on national AI governance legislation

  Scenario: Drafting Community AI Infrastructure Act for national funding
    Given poor communities nationwide need infrastructure support
    And I want equitable protocol access
    When I draft national funding legislation
    Then I provide: grants for community nodes and maintenance
    And I fund: research evaluating protocol outcomes
    And I support: technical assistance for poor communities
    And I establish: sliding scale and cross-subsidization
    And I treat: democratic AI governance as public infrastructure
    And I defend: against claims of "picking winners"
    And I argue: this enables democracy not market manipulation

  Scenario: Defending legislation against corporate capture testimony
    Given corporate lobbyists testify against my legislation
    And they claim it "stifles innovation"
    When I respond in committee hearing
    Then I present: evidence from Riverside and research
    And I show: protocol improves community outcomes
    And I demonstrate: constitutional oversight working
    And I compare: to corporate AI failures (surveillance, discrimination, no recourse)
    And I argue: we're stifling extraction, enabling flourishing
    And I maintain: that democracy deserves support
    And committee votes: 8-5 in favor despite lobbying

  Scenario: Creating Digital Constitutional Rights Amendment
    Given protocol creates new forms of governance and rights
    And constitutional recognition would strengthen legitimacy
    When I propose national constitutional amendment
    Then I recognize: sortition governance as legitimate democratic form
    And I establish: right to appeal agent decisions
    And I protect: community sovereignty over protocol adoption
    And I enshrine: privacy protections and dignity guarantees
    And amendment goes through: lengthy deliberative process
    And if passed: transforms national constitutional framework
    And protocol gains: highest legal recognition

  Scenario: Establishing federal-state coordination framework
    Given protocol operates at multiple layers
    And coordination is needed without centralization
    When I create federal-state cooperation legislation
    Then I establish: funding programs respecting state sovereignty
    And I create: interstate coordination mechanisms
    And I specify: federal role as support not control
    And I protect: community and state autonomy
    And I enable: national coherence with local diversity
    And I demonstrate: federalism working for AI governance

  Scenario: Integrating protocol with national court system
    Given judicial system must work with protocol governance
    And judges need training and procedural guidance
    When I work with judicial branch on integration
    Then I support: judicial education about agent reasoning
    And I establish: evidentiary standards for agent testimony
    And I create: appeal pathways for council-court conflicts
    And I ensure: due process protections maintained
    And I respect: judicial independence
    And I enable: protocol to function within legal framework

  Scenario: Addressing protocol implications for labor and employment law
    Given protocol affects work and value recognition
    And care work generates care tokens
    When I update labor law for protocol economy
    Then I clarify: status of care tokens vs traditional wages
    And I address: worker protections in protocol-mediated work
    And I ensure: fair labor standards apply
    And I update: social insurance for protocol participants
    And I protect: workers while enabling innovation
    And law adapts: to new forms of value creation

  Scenario: Creating national crisis reserve funds for protocol resilience
    Given crises may threaten protocol infrastructure
    And rapid response funding is needed
    When I establish emergency reserves
    Then I fund: rapid scaling for refugee crises
    And I support: attack response against corporate or authoritarian threats
    And I provide: disaster recovery for damaged infrastructure
    And reserves ensure: protocol survives shocks
    And resilience: is built into national support
    And democratic governance: can weather emergencies

  Scenario: Testifying to National Constitutional Council on policy needs
    Given National Council reviewing case with policy implications
    And they request my perspective as policy maker
    When I testify about legislative context
    Then I explain: existing law and its limitations
    And I describe: policy challenges protocol helps address
    And I clarify: how council precedent would affect legislation
    And I don't advocate: for particular constitutional interpretation
    And I inform: their deliberation with policy expertise
    And I demonstrate: collaboration between sortition and representative democracy

  Scenario: Commissioning independent research on protocol effectiveness
    Given I need evidence for policy evaluation
    And research must be independent to be credible
    When I establish national research program
    Then I fund: rigorous evaluation by independent researchers
    And I require: open access publication
    And I support: longitudinal studies tracking long-term outcomes
    And I enable: replication and peer review
    And I demand: honest reporting including null results
    And evidence base: supports informed democratic choice
    And public funding: serves public knowledge

  Scenario: Responding to national security agencies' concerns
    Given intelligence agencies claim protocol creates vulnerabilities
    And they request backdoors or monitoring capabilities
    When I evaluate security claims critically
    Then I consult: cryptographers about technical impossibility
    And I examine: whether concerns are legitimate or pretext
    And I compare: risks of backdoors vs risks they claim to address
    And I consider: historical abuse of security exceptions
    And I establish: oversight mechanisms if special provisions needed
    And I resist: security becoming excuse for unaccountable power
    And I protect: democracy even under security claims

  Scenario: Creating sunset provisions and mandatory review
    Given laws should be evaluated not permanent
    And I want to prevent ossification
    When I include sunset clauses in legislation
    Then laws expire: after 5-7 years unless renewed
    And I force: regular review of whether laws serve purpose
    And I create: opportunities to correct mistakes
    And I prevent: captured legislation persisting forever
    And democratic accountability: includes ability to reverse decisions

  Scenario: Participating in national media discourse on AI governance
    Given public understanding shapes political will
    And my voice carries weight as committee chair
    When I engage in public education
    Then I explain: why democratic AI governance matters
    And I describe: how protocol works and what's at stake
    And I acknowledge: uncertainties and limitations
    And I present: alternatives honestly (corporate control, heavy regulation, protocol)
    And I make: case for democratic choice
    And I avoid: partisan framing or ideological advocacy
    And I serve: informed democratic deliberation

  Scenario: Coordinating with international counterparts on AI governance
    Given AI governance is global challenge
    And national policies affect each other
    When I work with international policy makers
    Then we share: legislative approaches and evidence
    And we coordinate: to resist regulatory arbitrage
    And we establish: democratic governance norms
    And we resist: race-to-bottom dynamics
    And we protect: protocol sovereignty internationally
    And we support: global democratic AI development
