Feature: Global-Level Policy Making for AI Governance
  As a policy_maker in the governance system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want to participate in international AI governance frameworks
  So that democratic governance can flourish globally and resist authoritarian capture

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the policy_maker user is registered in the system
    And the global governance context is active
    And Senator Elena Ruiz participates in international governance forums

  Scenario: Advocating for protocol sovereignty in international forums
    Given international organizations discuss AI regulation
    And some proposals would mandate centralization
    When I advocate for democratic governance principles
    Then I argue: governments shouldn't mandate protocol architecture
    And I promote: community sovereignty as democratic principle
    And I defend: right of communities to adopt or reject protocol
    And I present: evidence that protocol sovereignty works
    And I resist: international regulation enabling authoritarian capture
    And I build: coalition of democratic nations supporting autonomy
    And I protect: space for democratic AI governance globally

  Scenario: Participating in UN discussions on AI governance standards
    Given United Nations addresses global AI governance
    And standards will affect billions of people
    When I represent my nation in UN deliberations
    Then I share: experience with protocol in my country
    And I advocate: for constitutional minimums as global standard
    And I present: evidence about sortition governance effectiveness
    And I promote: transparency and recourse as universal requirements
    And I resist: standards that advantage authoritarian control
    And I support: interoperability enabling coordination
    And I work: toward global framework respecting diversity

  Scenario: Opposing trade agreements compromising protocol sovereignty
    Given trade negotiations may include digital governance provisions
    And some proposals would restrict community autonomy
    When I evaluate trade agreement implications
    Then I identify: provisions threatening protocol sovereignty
    And I oppose: requirements mandating centralization or backdoors
    And I insist: on preserving community choice
    And I coalition: with other nations defending autonomy
    And I use: evidence showing protocol benefits economic wellbeing
    And I resist: regulatory arbitrage through trade agreements
    And I protect: democratic governance from corporate capture via trade

  Scenario: Supporting protocol adoption in Global South nations
    Given developing nations need technology transfer and support
    And protocol shouldn't be Global North privilege
    When I advocate for international development support
    Then I promote: funding for Global South protocol infrastructure
    And I support: technology transfer and capacity building
    And I resist: digital colonialism disguised as development
    And I ensure: Global South communities control their adoption
    And I fund: mutual aid between wealthy and poor communities
    And I work: toward global equity in democratic AI governance
    And I recognize: that justice requires reducing inequality

  Scenario: Learning from diverse national approaches to protocol
    Given different nations implemented protocol differently
    And cultural context shapes governance outcomes
    When I study international variations in implementation
    Then I learn: from collectivist societies' community emphasis
    And I examine: how different political systems integrate protocol
    And I identify: universal patterns vs context-specific adaptations
    And I share: lessons with other policy makers
    And I adapt: my legislation based on international evidence
    And I contribute: to global learning community
    And I practice: epistemic humility about cultural diversity

  Scenario: Coordinating response to authoritarian threats to protocol
    Given authoritarian regimes may attack protocol infrastructure
    And democratic nations must respond collectively
    When I participate in democratic coalition
    Then we share: threat intelligence and defensive strategies
    And we coordinate: mutual support for communities under threat
    And we establish: sanctuary systems for protocol refugees
    And we resist: authoritarian pressure through solidarity
    And we provide: resources for communities defending sovereignty
    And we demonstrate: that democracy protects itself
    And we show: authoritarian capture is not inevitable

  Scenario: Addressing global inequality in protocol access
    Given research shows protocol adoption correlates with national wealth
    And poor nations lack infrastructure for implementation
    When I advocate for global equity in access
    Then I promote: international funding mechanisms
    And I support: technology transfer without strings attached
    And I push: for open source hardware and software
    And I challenge: intellectual property barriers to adoption
    And I ensure: protocol doesn't exacerbate global inequality
    And I work: for democratic AI governance as universal right
    And I recognize: justice requires addressing structural barriers

  Scenario: Participating in global constitutional convention as observer
    Given Global Constitutional Convention convenes with 10,000 delegates
    And I attend as policy maker observer not delegate
    When I observe global deliberative democracy
    Then I learn: from how diverse humanity deliberates together
    And I see: what enables agreement despite profound disagreement
    And I witness: ordinary citizens governing existential questions
    And I prepare: to implement constitutional amendments in my nation
    And I translate: global constitutional evolution into national law
    And I am humbled: by wisdom of randomly-selected citizens
    And I understand: my role as servant of democratic will

  Scenario: Crafting legislation enabling global constitutional amendments
    Given Global Convention passed ecological standing amendment
    And national law must operationalize this
    When I translate constitutional evolution into legislation
    Then I grant: legal personhood to ecosystems as constitution requires
    And I update: property law to reflect ecological rights
    And I modify: administrative procedure for ecosystem representation
    And I ensure: national law aligns with global constitutional principle
    And I demonstrate: how global and national governance coordinate
    And I serve: democratic constitutional evolution
    And I show: policy making as implementing citizen wisdom

  Scenario: Building international coalition resisting corporate capture
    Given corporations lobby internationally for favorable regulation
    And they use different nations to triangulate pressure
    When I coordinate with international policy maker allies
    Then we share: intelligence about lobbying tactics
    And we coordinate: resistance to capture attempts
    And we establish: transparency requirements for global lobbying
    And we support: each other under corporate pressure
    And we create: race-to-top rather than race-to-bottom
    And we demonstrate: democratic solidarity across nations
    And we protect: protocol sovereignty through collective action

  Scenario: Addressing existential AI risk through democratic governance
    Given superintelligent AI poses existential threat
    And democratic oversight might mitigate this risk
    When I participate in global existential risk discussions
    Then I argue: constitutional accountability reduces AI risk
    And I present: evidence that sortition prevents elite capture
    And I promote: transparency enabling global democratic oversight
    And I support: recourse mechanisms providing adaptation
    And I advocate: for protocol's distributed architecture increasing resilience
    And I acknowledge: uncertainties about whether this suffices
    And I work: toward governance frameworks for humanity's survival

  Scenario: Promoting research on global AI governance effectiveness
    Given we need evidence about what works across contexts
    And global patterns require global research
    When I support international research infrastructure
    Then I fund: global research networks
    And I promote: data sharing with privacy protection
    And I support: global South researchers leading local studies
    And I ensure: open access to findings
    And I enable: cumulative knowledge building
    And I use: evidence for global policy advocacy
    And I demonstrate: policy making based on science not ideology

  Scenario: My national experience informs global AI governance norms
    Given my nation has years of protocol experience
    And other nations learn from our successes and failures
    When I share our experience in global forums
    Then I provide: honest assessment of what worked
    And I acknowledge: mistakes and challenges
    And I share: legislative approaches that helped
    And I describe: how we resisted capture
    And I explain: how communities maintained sovereignty
    And my testimony: informs global democratic governance development
    And national experience: contributes to global wisdom
