Feature: Municipal-Level Governance Coordination for Community Leader
  As a community_leader in the governance system
  Operating at the municipal governance layer
  I want to coordinate protocol across neighborhoods within the city
  So that different areas can collaborate while respecting local differences

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the community_leader user is registered in the system
    And the municipality governance context is active
    And Mayor Jamal coordinates across Riverside's diverse neighborhoods

  Scenario: Coordinating across neighborhoods with different needs
    Given Riverside has neighborhoods with different priorities
    And downtown needs economic development
    And residential areas prioritize environmental protection
    And outskirts need infrastructure investment
    When I facilitate municipal coordination
    Then Municipal Elohim: helps identify resource flows and conflicts
    And city council: deliberates on balancing neighborhood needs
    And we ensure: each neighborhood has voice in decisions
    And we negotiate: resource allocation serving whole city
    And protocol enables: coordination without centralization
    And neighborhoods retain: autonomy within municipal framework
    And I facilitate: democratic negotiation across differences

  Scenario: Municipal Elohim provides cross-neighborhood insights
    Given different neighborhoods have distinct challenges
    And patterns aren't visible at single-neighborhood scale
    When Municipal Elohim synthesizes cross-neighborhood data
    Then I see: resource flows between neighborhoods
    And I identify: opportunities for coordination
    And I notice: problems emerging in multiple areas
    And I recognize: how neighborhoods affect each other
    And I use: this information for city council decisions
    And I maintain: human judgment over agent information
    And agent enhances: my understanding without replacing leadership

  Scenario: Resolving conflict between neighborhood protocol calibrations
    Given different Riverside neighborhoods calibrated privacy differently
    And this creates friction when residents move between areas
    When I facilitate resolution of calibration conflicts
    Then we convene: representatives from affected neighborhoods
    And we deliberate: on whether harmonization is needed
    And we consider: if diversity should be preserved or reduced
    And we respect: neighborhood sovereignty within city context
    And we find: pragmatic accommodation of differences
    And we demonstrate: subsidiarity working across scales
    And democratic negotiation: resolves conflicts algorithm cannot

  Scenario: Municipal Constitutional Council handles city-level appeals
    Given some appeals affect multiple neighborhoods or city as whole
    And community-layer councils referred case to municipal level
    When Municipal Constitutional Council reviews the appeal
    Then I provide: city-wide context for their deliberation
    And they evaluate: if decision aligns with city's constitutional interpretation
    And they consider: effects across all Riverside neighborhoods
    And they create: municipal-level precedent
    And they may recommend: city council policy action
    And I implement: their recommendations respecting their authority
    And municipal governance: maintains democratic accountability

  Scenario: Integrating municipal services with protocol coordination
    Given city provides services (water, waste, transit, parks)
    And these need coordination with protocol resource flows
    When I integrate municipal services with Elohim coordination
    Then city departments: share data with agents appropriately
    And Municipal Elohim: helps optimize service delivery
    And environmental services: coordinate with Ecosystem Elohim
    And social services: work with Community Elohim for crisis response
    And integration respects: department professional judgment
    And agents augment: not replace city workers
    And public services improve: through better coordination

  Scenario: Municipal budget allocation informed by protocol data
    Given city council determines annual budget
    And we need evidence about neighborhood needs and priorities
    When Municipal Elohim provides resource flow analysis
    Then we see: which neighborhoods are underserved
    And we identify: where investments would have most impact
    And we understand: how different spending choices ripple across city
    And city council: deliberates and decides using this information
    And we maintain: political accountability for budget choices
    And protocol transparency: enables better democratic decision-making
    And agent information: serves elected governance

  Scenario: Coordinating economic development across municipality
    Given Riverside needs economic revitalization
    And different neighborhoods have different economic needs
    When I coordinate city-wide economic development strategy
    Then Municipal Elohim: analyzes economic flows and opportunities
    And we identify: where business support like Maria's loan needed most
    And we coordinate: workforce development with neighborhood needs
    And we ensure: economic growth benefits whole city not just wealthy areas
    And we integrate: protocol support with traditional economic development
    And we maintain: accountability to residents for economic choices
    And coordination strengthens: inclusive economic resilience

  Scenario: Municipal planning commission uses agent constitutional analysis
    Given planning commission reviews development proposals
    And developments affect multiple neighborhoods and city environment
    When Municipal Elohim provides constitutional analysis
    Then agent flags: if development would harm watershed
    And agent assesses: effects on housing affordability, traffic, equity
    And agent provides: constitutional principles analysis
    And planning commission: still makes final decision
    And commissioners: use information but maintain judgment authority
    And development review: incorporates constitutional considerations
    And city planning: serves broader values beyond narrow economics

  Scenario: Managing municipal-level crisis affecting whole city
    Given city-wide emergency (flood, economic shock, public health crisis)
    And coordination across neighborhoods is critical
    When I coordinate municipal crisis response
    Then Municipal Elohim: helps identify needs and match resources rapidly
    And we enable: mutual aid flows across neighborhoods
    And we coordinate: with county and state for additional support
    And I maintain: human judgment on crisis priorities
    And Municipal Constitutional Council: provides oversight even in emergency
    And we preserve: democratic accountability under pressure
    And protocol enhances: crisis response without sacrificing governance

  Scenario: Cross-municipal coordination with neighboring cities
    Given some challenges extend beyond Riverside boundaries
    And watershed management affects multiple municipalities
    When I coordinate with neighboring community leaders
    Then we convene: inter-municipal deliberative assemblies
    And agents from: different municipalities share analysis
    And we negotiate: agreements serving all communities
    And we respect: each municipality's sovereignty
    And we find: synthesis through democratic deliberation
    And lateral coordination: addresses problems that don't respect boundaries
    And we demonstrate: governance working across jurisdictions

  Scenario: Municipal transparency dashboard for public accountability
    Given residents deserve visibility into city governance
    And I am accountable through democratic elections
    When we provide municipal transparency dashboard
    Then residents see: resource flows across neighborhoods
    And they access: appeal patterns and council decisions
    And they view: city budget allocation and outcomes
    And they compare: promised benefits with actual results
    And they hold me accountable: with evidence not just rhetoric
    And transparency strengthens: democratic governance
    And I cannot hide: behind "algorithm decided" or "trust me"

  Scenario: Municipal level participates in county-state coordination
    Given Riverside is part of larger county and state systems
    And protocol must integrate with these layers
    When I coordinate upward with county and state governance
    Then I share: Riverside's experience with protocol adoption
    And I advocate: for policies supporting municipal sovereignty
    And I provide: evidence about outcomes for policy makers
    And I resist: regulatory overreach from higher layers
    And I seek: resources and support from county and state
    And I maintain: that community adopted protocol voluntarily
    And I protect: subsidiarity principle in multi-layer governance

  Scenario: Training city staff to work alongside protocol agents
    Given city employees need to understand protocol to do their jobs
    And they may feel threatened by AI systems
    When I coordinate staff training and cultural adaptation
    Then we explain: how protocol augments not replaces their work
    And we provide: training on working with agent information
    And we clarify: that professional judgment remains valued
    And we ensure: staff see agents as tools not replacements
    And we maintain: good jobs with dignity for city workers
    And we demonstrate: that democratic AI can strengthen not undermine labor
    And implementation respects: people doing the work

  Scenario: Municipal governance evolution through protocol learning
    Given Riverside has three years implementing protocol
    And we have learned what works and what doesn't
    When I reflect on governance transformation
    Then I see: city council making better-informed decisions
    And I notice: residents more engaged through transparency
    And I observe: faster crisis response with better coordination
    And I acknowledge: challenges with accessibility and occasional controversy
    And I understand: protocol enhanced but didn't replace democratic governance
    And I know: community remains in control through sovereignty and calibration
    And I have become: leader facilitating partnership with AI not commanding it
