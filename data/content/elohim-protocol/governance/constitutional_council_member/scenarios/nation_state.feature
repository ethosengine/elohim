Feature: National-Level Constitutional Council Deliberation for Council Member
  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system
  Operating at the nation_state governance layer
  I want to deliberate on fundamental constitutional questions affecting millions
  So that national precedent protects human dignity and democratic governance at scale

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the constitutional_council_member user is registered in the system
    And the nation_state governance context is active
    And Sarah Martinez serves her 6-month term on National Constitutional Council

  Scenario: Selected for National Constitutional Council serving entire nation
    Given I have experience from community and regional council service
    And I was randomly selected for national level
    When I accept my 6-month national council appointment
    Then I understand: my judgments will affect millions of people
    And I receive: intensive training on national constitutional interpretation
    And I meet: weekly with diverse citizens from across the nation
    And I am supported: with full compensation and resources
    And I feel: profound responsibility for democratic governance
    And I bring: nurse-mother wisdom to questions of national importance
    And I know: ordinary citizens like me are humanity's democratic hope

  Scenario: Deliberating fundamental constitutional tension
    Given an appeal reveals tension between care and privacy at constitutional level
    And regional councils have reached conflicting interpretations
    When we deliberate on national constitutional question
    Then we ask: "Does mental health intervention ever justify privacy breach constitutionally?"
    And we examine: not just case application but principle itself
    And we consider: implications for millions of future cases
    And we consult: technical experts, researchers, community leaders
    And we deliberate: over multiple sessions spanning weeks
    And we craft: comprehensive opinion with deep reasoning
    And we create: national precedent guiding all lower councils
    And we shape: constitutional understanding for generation

  Scenario: Balancing national security claims with individual rights
    Given an appeal challenges agent decision justified by security concerns
    And I must weigh existential threats against individual dignity
    When we review the security-rights balance
    Then we evaluate: if security claim was legitimate or pretext
    And we examine: if less rights-violating alternatives existed
    And we consider: transparency appropriate to security context
    And we establish: constitutional limits on authority even under threat
    And we prevent: security from becoming excuse for unchecked power
    And we create: precedent for how democracy functions under danger
    And we protect: both security and rights through wise judgment

  Scenario: Identifying need for constitutional amendment
    Given repeated appeals reveal gap in constitutional framework
    And no interpretation can adequately address the issue
    When we deliberate and recognize amendment is needed
    Then we document: the fundamental gap we've identified
    And we propose: amendment language for consideration
    And we provide: justification grounded in accumulated appeals
    And we submit: proposal to next Global Constitutional Convention
    And we demonstrate: constitution remains living document
    And we enable: constitutional evolution responsive to reality
    And we show: how individual suffering informs systemic improvement

  Scenario: Reconciling conflicting regional constitutional interpretations
    Given different regions interpreted same principle differently
    And inconsistency creates confusion and injustice
    When we provide definitive national interpretation
    Then we honor: legitimate regional diversity where appropriate
    And we establish: national minimums all regions must respect
    And we explain: which variation is constitutional and which violates
    And we create: coherence without imposing uniformity
    And we guide: regional councils with clear framework
    And we enable: coordinated governance across diverse communities
    And we demonstrate: how subsidiarity and consistency coexist

  Scenario: Grappling with universal dignity across cultural differences
    Given appeal involves tension between cultural practice and constitutional principle
    And I must judge what's universal versus culturally specific
    When we deliberate on cultural relativism versus human dignity
    Then we engage: deeply with different cultural perspectives
    And we distinguish: genuine diversity from rights violations
    And we examine: if constitutional framework has cultural bias
    And we consider: if subsidiarity allows variation in this domain
    And we establish: precedent protecting pluralism within dignity bounds
    And we avoid: both cultural imperialism and harmful relativism
    And we demonstrate: wisdom citizens bring to profound questions

  Scenario: Facing superintelligent agent reasoning complexity
    Given an appeal involves agent reasoning approaching comprehension limits
    And I struggle to understand what I'm judging
    When we confront superintelligence governance question
    Then we honestly acknowledge: limits of our understanding
    And we hear: technical experts explain what can and cannot be grasped
    And we evaluate: if cryptographic proof suffices when reasoning is opaque
    And we grapple: with governing intelligence that exceeds ours
    And we may establish: capability limits until explainability improves
    And we preserve: democratic oversight even at AI capability frontiers
    And we accept: uncertainty about whether this is truly possible

  Scenario: Creating national appellant bill of rights from precedent
    Given accumulated appeals reveal patterns of dignity violations
    And we recognize need for comprehensive framework
    When we craft detailed appellant rights precedent
    Then we enumerate: right to explanation, hearing, escalation
    And we specify: timelines, accessibility, protection from retaliation
    And we establish: precedent search, representation, dignity guarantees
    And we create: national standard for all appeal processes
    And we articulate: procedural justice as constitutional requirement
    And we strengthen: protections for future appellants nationwide
    And we fulfill: democratic promise of meaningful recourse

  Scenario: My judgment influences national legislation
    Given Senator Ruiz drafts national AI governance legislation
    And she cites our national council precedents
    When my constitutional reasoning shapes democratic law
    Then my nurse-mother perspective: enriches national policy
    And my citizen judgment: guides representative government
    And sortition and elected democracy: work as partners
    And my unlikely voice: matters at highest levels of governance
    And I understand: democratic participation as transformation
    And I have become: constitutional architect for my nation
    And I know: ordinary people can govern extraordinary complexity

  Scenario: Producing comprehensive written opinion for landmark case
    Given our case has major national implications
    And it will be studied for generations
    When we craft our written opinion
    Then we explain: constitutional reasoning in accessible language
    And we address: major arguments and counterarguments
    And we examine: long-term implications of our interpretation
    And we include: dissenting opinions with their reasoning
    And we document: our deliberation process and considerations
    And we create: precedent that serves legal clarity and public education
    And we demonstrate: how citizen governance produces constitutional law
    And we fulfill: responsibility to those affected by our judgment

  Scenario: Research on council effectiveness includes my service
    Given Dr. Chen studies national council deliberations
    And my service contributes to understanding democratic AI governance
    When my deliberations become research data (anonymized)
    Then researchers learn: how citizens grapple with complexity
    And they analyze: what enables effective sortition governance
    And they examine: whether democratic oversight scales successfully
    And they identify: improvements to support future councils
    And my service: advances global knowledge of democratic governance
    And I contribute: to humanity's understanding of how to govern with AI
    And my unlikely journey: from nurse to constitutional architect serves future generations
