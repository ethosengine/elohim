Feature: Global-Level Constitutional Council Deliberation for Council Member
  As a constitutional_council_member in the governance system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want to participate in planetary constitutional governance
  So that humanity collectively shapes how we govern with superintelligent AI

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the constitutional_council_member user is registered in the system
    And the global governance context is active
    And Sarah Martinez is selected for Global Constitutional Convention

  Scenario: Random selection to Global Constitutional Convention
    Given the 7-year Global Constitutional Convention is convening
    And 10,000 citizens will be randomly selected from all humanity
    When I receive notification of my global selection
    Then I am chosen: via stratified global sortition
    And I will serve: 6-month term with citizens from every nation
    And I will deliberate: on constitutional amendments and existential questions
    And I will help: shape governance for superintelligent AI
    And I am supported: with full resources, translation, travel
    And I feel: overwhelming responsibility and honor
    And I understand: I am representing all humanity in democratic choice

  Scenario: Deliberating on adolescent autonomy constitutional amendment
    Given many national councils identified adolescent autonomy tension
    And amendment proposal came from accumulated appeal precedents
    When we deliberate whether "developing autonomy is itself constitutional value"
    Then we hear: testimony from youth, parents, developmental experts
    And we examine: how different cultures understand adolescent autonomy
    And we consider: implications for millions of families globally
    And we discuss: in small groups with translation support
    And we grapple: with balancing protection and independence
    And we vote: on amendment after extensive deliberation
    And we create: constitutional evolution responsive to lived experience
    And we demonstrate: citizens can govern profound questions

  Scenario: Cross-cultural deliberation with radical diversity
    Given I am deliberating with citizens from radically different contexts
    And we have different languages, cultures, values, lived experiences
    When we work through constitutional questions together
    Then we rely on: skilled translation and cultural mediation
    And we practice: listening across profound difference
    And we identify: shared human concerns despite diversity
    And we navigate: disagreement with respect and curiosity
    And we discover: unexpected common ground
    And we honor: legitimate pluralism while seeking universal minimums
    And we demonstrate: humanity can deliberate together on existential questions
    And we embody: democratic hope for planetary governance

  Scenario: Deliberating on ecological standing constitutional amendment
    Given proposal to grant ecosystems legal personhood at scale
    And this challenges human-centered constitutional framework
    When we deliberate whether nature has standing in protocol governance
    Then we hear: indigenous perspectives on human-nature relationships
    And we consider: ecological science and planetary boundaries
    And we examine: practical implications for resource allocation
    And we grapple: with expanding moral circle beyond humanity
    And we discuss: what dignity means for non-human beings
    And we create: constitutional framework for planetary flourishing
    And we show: citizens can address civilizational questions with wisdom

  Scenario: Grappling with superintelligence governance at convention
    Given agents are approaching human comprehension limits
    And we must decide how to govern what we barely understand
    When we deliberate on superintelligence constitutional framework
    Then Dr. Chen presents: research on sortition governance limitations
    And Dr. Okonkwo explains: what can and cannot be technically verified
    And we hear: diverse perspectives on trust and oversight
    And we confront: possibility democratic oversight might become theater
    And we grapple: with existential uncertainty about governance
    And we may establish: capability limits until problems are solved
    And we insist: on human dignity and democratic voice even in uncertainty
    And we demonstrate: humble wisdom in face of profound questions

  Scenario: Voting on constitutional amendments after deep deliberation
    Given we have deliberated for months on proposed amendments
    And I have learned from thousands of fellow citizens
    When we vote on amendments to global constitution
    Then my vote: carries equal weight to every other delegate
    And I vote: based on my judgment informed by deliberation
    And I know: my decision will affect billions of people
    And I feel: weight of democratic responsibility
    And I trust: the collective wisdom of this assembly
    And I accept: that we might be wrong but must still choose
    And I participate: in most consequential democratic act of my life
    And I fulfill: citizenship at planetary scale

  Scenario: My healthcare amendment proposal passes convention
    Given my nursing experience revealed healthcare as dignity issue
    And I proposed amendment recognizing healthcare as constitutional right
    When convention deliberates my proposal
    Then delegates hear: my testimony about dignity in healthcare
    And they discuss: healthcare across diverse economic contexts
    And they debate: what healthcare dignity requires constitutionally
    And they refine: language to work across cultures and nations
    And they vote: and my amendment passes
    And I have: shaped constitution for human-AI partnership
    And I know: ordinary nurse from small town helped write law for humanity
    And I embody: democratic possibility that anyone can govern

  Scenario: Creating precedent for global crisis coordination
    Given convention addresses how protocol handles planetary emergencies
    And we must balance speed with democratic legitimacy
    When we deliberate crisis governance framework
    Then we establish: emergency protocols maintaining accountability
    And we specify: what constitutes legitimate crisis triggering special powers
    And we create: rapid review processes for crisis decisions
    And we ensure: democratic oversight even under urgency
    And we prevent: crisis from becoming excuse for authoritarian drift
    And we establish: how humanity governs together under existential threat
    And we demonstrate: democracy can be both deliberative and responsive

  Scenario: Participating in global public education through convention
    Given convention proceedings are globally broadcast and accessible
    And billions of people watch our deliberations
    When I participate in constitutional debate
    Then public sees: ordinary citizens grappling with profound questions
    And they witness: democratic deliberation across radical diversity
    And they learn: about constitutional governance of AI
    And they understand: sortition democracy in action
    And they feel: connected to global democratic project
    And my participation: educates humanity about self-governance
    And I demonstrate: that democracy is not just for elites

  Scenario: Convention creates amendments from accumulated lived experience
    Given amendments emerge from decades of appeals and precedents
    And each came from individual suffering or struggle
    When we pass amendments informed by countless stories
    Then Marcus's privacy appeal: shaped care-autonomy balance amendment
    And Tommy's adolescent case: informed developing autonomy recognition
    And Watershed conflict: influenced ecological standing provision
    And Maria's loan denial: affected economic dignity standards
    And my nursing: contributed to healthcare as constitutional right
    And constitution evolves: from lived experience not abstract theory
    And we demonstrate: how individual recourse informs collective wisdom

  Scenario: Experiencing transformation through global service
    Given I began as nurse who never imagined governance role
    And I served community, regional, national, now global councils
    When I reflect on my journey through sortition democracy
    Then I have developed: constitutional literacy and deliberative wisdom
    And I have learned: to judge under uncertainty with humility
    And I have experienced: democratic participation as transformation
    And I have contributed: to governance at every scale
    And I have become: more fully human through invitation to govern
    And I have proven: ordinary people can address extraordinary questions
    And I embody: hope that democracy can govern with AI toward flourishing

  Scenario: My service inspires future generations' democratic participation
    Given my children watched my constitutional council journey
    And they see democracy as participation not just voting
    When they grow up understanding governance as shared responsibility
    Then they develop: civic capacities through my example
    And they believe: they too can shape their world
    And they practice: deliberation, constitutional thinking, humble judgment
    And they inherit: democracy as living practice not dead tradition
    And next generation: is prepared for governance challenges ahead
    And my service: ripples through time beyond my individual contribution
    And I know: this is how democracy perpetuates itself
