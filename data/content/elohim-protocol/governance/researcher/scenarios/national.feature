Feature: National Governance for Researcher
  As a researcher in the governance system
  Operating at the national governance layer
  I want to conduct longitudinal research on democratic AI governance
  So that long-term effects and transformations are rigorously documented

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational across the entire nation
    And Dr. James Chen is conducting 10-year longitudinal study
    And the national governance context is active
    And James has secured multi-year funding from National Science Foundation
    And research follows cohorts of communities, councils, and individuals over time

  Scenario: Establish 10-year longitudinal study tracking protocol evolution
    Given James begins study in 2025 when protocol is newly adopted
    And he wants to understand long-term transformation effects
    When James designs the longitudinal research
    Then he selects cohort of 50 diverse communities to track
    And he recruits sample of Constitutional Council members to follow
    And he establishes baseline measurements before protocol adoption
    And he plans annual follow-up measurements for 10 years
    And he commits to capturing both positive and negative long-term effects

  Scenario: Track how Riverside community evolves over 10 years
    Given Riverside adopted protocol in Year 1 of study
    When James returns annually to measure changes
    Then he tracks wellbeing indicators over full decade
    And he documents how trust builds incrementally not instantaneously
    And he observes how civic participation increases over time
    And he identifies challenges that emerge only after years of operation
    And he captures transformation that short-term studies miss
    And longitudinal design reveals cumulative effects

  Scenario: Follow Sarah Martinez's democratic development after council service
    Given Sarah served on Constitutional Council in Year 3
    When James interviews Sarah annually for 7 years
    Then he documents immediate effects on her constitutional literacy
    And he tracks how she participates differently in community afterward
    And he observes her selection for regional council in Year 5
    And he examines her participation in Global Convention in Year 7
    And he captures how sortition governance transforms citizens over time
    And individual trajectory illustrates broader pattern

  Scenario: Study whether children growing up with protocol develop different capacities
    Given Tommy was 12 when Riverside adopted protocol
    And James tracks cohort of adolescents through development
    When James compares protocol-exposed youth to control group
    Then he measures civic engagement, constitutional literacy, and deliberative skills
    And he finds protocol-exposed youth have stronger democratic capacities
    And he documents different relationship to AI than parents' generation
    And he examines whether effects persist into young adulthood
    And generational analysis reveals transformative potential

  Scenario: Analyze whether initial wellbeing gains sustain or decay
    Given early studies showed 8% life satisfaction improvement
    And question is whether gains persist long-term
    When James examines 10-year trajectory
    Then he finds initial gains sustain through Year 5
    And he observes additional gains accumulating in Years 6-10
    And he discovers trust compounds over time
    And he identifies that sustained benefit requires continued democratic participation
    And longitudinal perspective distinguishes honeymoon effects from stable transformation

  Scenario: Document how national Constitutional Council precedents evolve
    Given James has access to decade of council decisions
    When he analyzes constitutional interpretation evolution
    Then he tracks how privacy threshold precedents changed over time
    And he examines what drives constitutional evolution (new cases, research, social change)
    And he identifies increasing sophistication in council reasoning
    And he documents how precedent database becomes institutional wisdom
    And constitutional evolution is captured empirically

  Scenario: Study systematic bias correction over time
    Given Year 2 research identified bias affecting marginalized communities
    And protocol modifications were implemented in Year 3
    When James tracks bias indicators through Year 10
    Then he measures whether modifications successfully reduced bias
    And he documents improved outcomes for marginalized communities
    And he identifies remaining persistent inequalities
    And he evaluates effectiveness of bias correction mechanisms
    And longitudinal accountability serves justice

  Scenario: Provide evidence to Senator Ruiz for federal policy continuation
    Given Elena needs evidence that federal funding produces lasting benefits
    When James presents 10-year findings to Senate Committee
    Then he shows sustained wellbeing improvements across decade
    And he demonstrates democratic capacity building persists
    And he documents cost-effectiveness over long-term horizon
    And he provides honest assessment of challenges and failures
    And his rigorous longitudinal research justifies continued federal investment

  Scenario: Examine cohort effects comparing early vs late adopters
    Given communities adopted protocol at different times across decade
    When James compares adoption cohorts
    Then he finds early adopters benefit from learning community support
    And he discovers later adopters benefit from improved protocol versions
    And he identifies that community context matters more than timing
    And cohort analysis illuminates adoption dynamics

  Scenario: Investigate whether protocol governance quality degrades as it scales
    Given protocol expanded from dozens to thousands of communities
    When James examines governance quality metrics over scale
    Then he tracks Constitutional Council deliberation quality
    And he measures appeal resolution fairness over time
    And he examines whether coordination complexity overwhelms benefits
    And he finds quality generally sustains but identifies scaling challenges
    And research informs protocol architecture improvements

  Scenario: Study long-term effects on mental health and social cohesion
    Given protocol aims to reduce loneliness and improve wellbeing
    When James analyzes decade of mental health and cohesion data
    Then he finds sustained reduction in loneliness indicators
    And he documents improved community social networks
    And he examines whether benefits distribute equitably
    And he identifies mental health improvements particularly strong for isolated individuals
    And long-term health effects justify protocol as public health intervention

  Scenario: Publish comprehensive 10-year findings in major journal
    Given James has completed decade-long study
    When he prepares comprehensive research report
    Then he documents methodology with full transparency
    And he presents both positive findings and disappointments
    And he acknowledges uncertainties and limitations
    And he makes full dataset available for replication
    And he publishes open access in multiple formats
    And he contributes definitive evidence about democratic AI governance at scale
