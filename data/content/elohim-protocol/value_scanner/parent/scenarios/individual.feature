Feature: Individual Layer Value Recognition for Parent
  As a parent performing intensive care labor while working full-time
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want my personal identity and well-being to be preserved
  So that I can sustain care work without losing myself

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah is 34 years old
    And Sarah is mother to Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And Sarah works full-time as a teacher
    And Sarah manages 75% of household care labor
    And the individual governance context is active
    And Sarah's personal_agent is configured for complex care coordination

  Scenario: Personal agent recognizes parent as individual beyond caregiving role
    Given Sarah has been performing intensive care labor all day
    And she has attended to children's needs, household needs, and work needs
    When Sarah's personal_agent assesses her daily patterns
    Then the agent should recognize Sarah as a person with individual needs
    And the agent should prompt "When did you last do something just for yourself?"
    And the system should validate that self-care enables care for others
    And Sarah should be reminded that she exists beyond her caregiving roles
    And individual identity should be actively preserved
    And the agent should protect space for Sarah's autonomous personhood

  Scenario: Making the invisible mental load visible to self
    Given Sarah manages complex care coordination across multiple people
    And she tracks schedules, preferences, allergies, developmental needs, and household inventory
    When the personal_agent monitors Sarah's cognitive labor
    Then it should quantify the mental load she carries
    And it should make visible the dozens of decisions she makes hourly
    And it should show "Today you managed 127 care-related decisions"
    And Sarah should see that her mental labor is real work
    And the invisible should become undeniably visible
    And her cognitive labor should be valued as professional-grade skill

  Scenario: Personal burnout risk detection and intervention
    Given Sarah has been operating at unsustainable intensity
    And she wakes at 5:30am and works until 10pm daily
    When the personal_agent detects burnout patterns
    Then it should flag the unsustainability explicitly
    And it should say "This pace will break you. You need support."
    And it should connect her to respite resources
    And it should help her identify what must give
    And crisis intervention should be immediate and clear
    And the system should prioritize her survival over perfection

  Scenario: Care token accumulation reflects totality of invisible labor
    Given Sarah performs mental labor and physical labor continuously
    And traditional economics renders her household work invisible
    When the Value Scanner tracks Sarah's care contributions
    Then care tokens should accumulate for meal planning, not just cooking
    And tokens should reflect coordinating schedules, managing inventory, teaching values
    And emotional labor should be valued alongside physical tasks
    And the full complexity of parenting work should be quantified
    And Sarah's care token balance should reflect her enormous contributions
    And invisible care labor should become economically visible

  Scenario: Personal agent serves as cognitive partner for impossible complexity
    Given Sarah must coordinate Tommy's wonder-preservation with Emma's autonomy-building
    And also manage budget, nutrition, schedules, and her work responsibilities
    When Sarah uses her personal_agent for decision support
    Then the agent should hold all relevant factors simultaneously
    And it should surface conflicts: "Tommy needs experiential learning but you have 20 minutes before work"
    And it should suggest realistic solutions within constraints
    And it should reduce cognitive load dramatically
    And Sarah should experience genuine partnership
    And the agent should make impossible complexity manageable

  Scenario: Individual flourishing metrics beyond caregiving productivity
    Given Sarah's value extends far beyond care productivity
    And she is a complete person deserving of flourishing
    When the system measures Sarah's well-being
    Then it should track her joy, rest, creative expression, and growth
    And it should measure whether she's experiencing life beyond caregiving
    And it should flag if she has no non-caregiving identity markers
    And individual flourishing should be valued as essential
    And Sarah should be supported in being whole, not just productive
    And the care economy should enable her complete humanity

  Scenario: Privacy protection for parent's personal life
    Given Sarah's care work generates extensive data
    And she has full privacy rights as an individual
    When care economy data is collected
    Then Sarah must have complete control over her personal information
    And no third party access should be permitted without explicit consent
    And her parenting patterns should not be monetized
    And the system should protect her from surveillance capitalism
    And privacy should be default, not opt-in
    And Sarah's dignity should be protected through data sovereignty

  Scenario: Right to be imperfect parent without shame
    Given Sarah cannot possibly meet all demands perfectly
    And parenting culture enforces impossible standards
    When Sarah makes suboptimal choices under constraint
    Then the personal_agent should never shame or guilt
    And it should validate "You're doing your best with available resources"
    And it should recognize that good-enough parenting is actually good
    And perfectionism should be rejected as harmful
    And Sarah should be supported in sustainable imperfection
    And the system should counteract toxic parenting culture

  Scenario: Personal capacity limits respected and enforced
    Given Sarah has finite energy, time, and emotional capacity
    And demands regularly exceed her available resources
    When Sarah approaches capacity limits
    Then the personal_agent should help her identify what to drop
    And it should validate saying no to non-essential demands
    And it should recognize that she cannot do everything
    And capacity constraints should be treated as real boundaries
    And the system should support sustainable pacing
    And Sarah should learn that limitations are human, not failure

  Scenario: Individual skill development beyond parenting role
    Given Sarah has professional teaching capabilities
    And she has interests beyond children and household
    When the personal_agent supports Sarah's development
    Then it should encourage skill-building in non-parenting domains
    And it should help her maintain professional identity
    And it should support her creative interests and intellectual growth
    And Sarah should have space to develop as complete person
    And the system should prevent parenting from consuming total identity
    And individual growth should be valued as essential to sustainability

  Scenario: Recognition that parenting skills are professional-grade capabilities
    Given Sarah performs developmental psychology, nutritional science, financial management
    And she coordinates logistics, resolves conflicts, and does long-term strategic planning
    When the system assesses Sarah's capabilities
    Then it should recognize parenting as professional-grade work
    And her skills should be valued as marketable expertise
    And the system should translate parenting skills to professional context
    And Sarah should understand she's performing sophisticated labor
    And her care tokens could translate to professional credit
    And parenting should be recognized as skilled professional work

  Scenario: Personal values preservation despite intense care demands
    Given Sarah has core values beyond efficient caregiving
    And she wants to raise children aligned with those values
    When Sarah makes care decisions under pressure
    Then the personal_agent should help her honor her values
    And it should flag when expedience conflicts with principles
    And it should support value-aligned decision making even when harder
    And Sarah's integrity should be preserved despite overwhelming demands
    And the system should help her be the parent she wants to be
    And values should not be sacrificed to mere survival
