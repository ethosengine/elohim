Feature: Educational Layer Value Recognition for Parent
  As a parent who is both professional teacher and primary educator of own children
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want recognition that parents are children's primary educators
  So that home and school learning are coordinated and parent education work is valued

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user "Sarah" is registered in the system
    And Sarah is a professional teacher working full-time
    And Sarah is also the primary educator for Tommy (5) and Emma (8)
    And the educational governance context is active
    And the educational_elohim could coordinate home and school learning
    And Sarah understands education from both professional and parent perspectives

  Scenario: Parent recognized as child's primary educator
    Given Sarah teaches Tommy and Emma continuously at home
    And she is their first and most influential teacher
    When the educational_elohim tracks educational contributions
    Then it should recognize Sarah's parenting as educational work
    And it should value home education alongside school education
    And Sarah's teaching labor should accumulate care tokens
    And parents should be understood as primary educators
    And schools should be partners in education, not replacements for parents
    And the system should make parent educational labor visible

  Scenario: Coordinating home learning with school curriculum
    Given Emma is learning math at school
    And Sarah reinforces and extends learning at home
    When the educational_elohim coordinates home and school
    Then it should share relevant learning information between contexts
    And it should help Sarah support Emma's school learning
    And it should recognize Sarah's home teaching as essential to school success
    And home and school should be integrated educational environment
    And the system should facilitate coordination between parents and teachers
    And Sarah's educational labor should be visible to Emma's school

  Scenario: Parent expertise in child development informs school practices
    Given Sarah has professional teaching expertise
    And she knows her children's developmental needs intimately
    When Sarah engages with children's schools
    Then her expertise should be recognized and valued
    And teachers should consult Sarah's knowledge of Tommy and Emma
    And parent-teacher relationships should be expert collaboration
    And Sarah's observations should inform educational planning
    And the system should position parents as expert partners

  Scenario: Teaching value literacy as core educational content
    Given Sarah is raising Tommy and Emma in care economy framework
    And she teaches them to recognize and value care work

    Then it should recognize this as essential educational content
    And teaching care economy principles should be valued as academic instruction
    And Sarah's value literacy teaching should accumulate care tokens
    And preparing children for care-based economy should be educational priority
    And the system should support parents teaching alternative economic values
    And value literacy should be recognized as critical life skill

  Scenario: Parent educational labor outside formal schooling hours
    Given Sarah teaches Tommy and Emma during evenings and weekends
    And homework support, life skills, critical thinking happen at home
    When the educational_elohim tracks Sarah's teaching time
    Then it should quantify hours spent on educational labor
    And it should recognize teaching homework as skilled instructional work
    And it should value informal education alongside formal instruction
    And Sarah's non-school teaching should accumulate care tokens
    And the system should make invisible educational labor visible
    And parent teaching should be recognized as professional-grade work

  Scenario: Different pedagogical approaches for different children
    Given Tommy (5) needs wonder-preservation pedagogy
    And Emma (8) needs autonomy-building instruction
    When Sarah teaches her children with different approaches
    Then the educational_elohim should recognize pedagogical sophistication
    And it should value Sarah's ability to differentiate instruction
    And teaching multiple children at different stages should be recognized as complex
    And Sarah's educational expertise should be documented
    And the system should recognize professional-grade teaching capability
    And differentiated instruction should be valued as advanced skill

  Scenario: Parent advocacy for better educational policies
    Given Sarah understands education from both sides
    And she advocates for family-friendly school policies

    And parent organizing for educational improvement should be valued
    And Sarah's work to improve schools should be community contribution
    And the system should recognize education advocacy as care labor
    And parent voices should be amplified in education governance

  Scenario: Homeschooling recognized as full educational provision
    Given some parents provide complete education at home
    And homeschooling is intensive educational labor
    When the educational_elohim tracks homeschooling work
    Then it should recognize full-time teaching by parents
    And homeschooling should accumulate substantial care tokens
    And the system should value parent-provided education fully
    And homeschooling parents should have economic support for educational work
    And care economy should recognize diverse educational approaches
    And parent teaching should be valued regardless of institutional setting

  Scenario: Parent emotional labor in supporting children's learning
    Given Sarah manages Tommy's frustration with difficult tasks

  Scenario: Educational expenses tracked and valued as investment
    Given Sarah spends money on books, materials, educational experiences
    And educational expenses are part of parenting work
    When the educational_elohim tracks family educational investment
    Then it should recognize financial investment in children's learning
    And it should help Sarah budget for educational needs
    And educational expenses should be visible to extended family
    And the community should support family educational investment
    And the system should recognize both time and money spent on education
    And care tokens should reflect total educational contribution

  Scenario: Parent knowledge of child's learning needs informs IEP and accommodations
    Given Sarah knows Tommy's and Emma's learning patterns intimately
    And children may need educational accommodations
    When schools develop individualized education plans

    And schools should recognize parents as essential IEP partners
    And the system should position parent knowledge as authoritative
    And Sarah's advocacy for children's needs should be valued and supported

  Scenario: Lifelong learning modeled and taught by parent
