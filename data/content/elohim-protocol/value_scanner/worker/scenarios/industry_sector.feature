Feature: Industry-Level Worker Advocacy and Sector Transformation
  As a worker in the food service industry
  I need to participate in industry-level advocacy for systemic change
  So that workers across the sector gain dignity, fair compensation, and care-aligned conditions

  Background:
    Given I work in the food service industry
    And the industry is characterized by low wages, poor conditions, and high turnover
    And the protocol connects workers across the industry
    And industry-level advocacy can create systemic change

  Scenario: Connecting with workers across food service industry
    Given food service workers face similar exploitation patterns
    And collective action requires cross-workplace organization
    When I want to connect with other food service workers
    Then the protocol should facilitate industry-wide worker networks
    And help me find worker organizing groups and unions
    And support building solidarity across restaurants and food businesses
    And enable coordination for industry-level advocacy

  Scenario: Documenting industry-wide exploitation patterns
    Given low wages and poor conditions are systemic across food service
    When the protocol aggregates data from workers across the industry
    Then it should identify widespread exploitation patterns
    And make visible that individual workplace problems are systemic
    And provide evidence for industry-level policy advocacy
    And demonstrate need for sector transformation

  Scenario: Advocating for industry-wide living wage standards
    Given current food service wages are systematically too low to live on
    When workers organize for living wage campaigns
    Then the protocol should support industry-wide living wage advocacy
    And provide evidence of inadequate current wages
    And help workers coordinate collective demands
    And build movement for mandatory living wage in food service

  Scenario: Pushing for industry scheduling regulations
    Given unpredictable scheduling is endemic in food service
    When workers advocate for fair scheduling laws
    Then the protocol should support advocacy for scheduling regulations
    Such as advance notice requirements, predictable hours, right to request schedule
    And provide evidence of harm from current scheduling practices
    And coordinate workers pushing for legislative change
    And transform industry standards through policy intervention

  Scenario: Organizing for universal benefits in food service
    Given many food service workers lack health insurance, paid leave, or retirement
    When workers advocate for universal benefits
    Then the protocol should support campaigns for mandatory benefits
    And help workers articulate need for healthcare, sick leave, and security
    And coordinate advocacy for industry-wide benefit requirements
    And push for decoupling essential benefits from individual employer provision

  Scenario: Challenging tipped wage systems
    Given tipped minimum wage is exploitative and creates instability
    When workers organize to eliminate tipped wage and demand full minimum wage
    Then the protocol should support advocacy for one fair wage
    And provide evidence of problems with tipped wage systems
    And help workers coordinate across tipped industries
    And push for legislative elimination of tipped wage carveouts

  Scenario: Addressing industry culture of exploitation
    Given food service industry culture normalizes worker exploitation
    When workers want to transform industry culture
    Then the protocol should support cultural change advocacy
    And help workers articulate vision for dignified food service work
    And build consciousness that current conditions are unjust not inevitable
    And create movement for care-economy-aligned industry transformation

  Scenario: Advocating for industry training and skill development
    Given food service work involves significant skill but is undervalued
    When workers advocate for professional development and advancement paths
    Then the protocol should support advocacy for industry training programs
    And help workers demand investment in skill development
    And push for career pathways and mobility within industry
    And challenge perception of food service as unskilled disposable labor

  Scenario: Organizing around food worker food insecurity
    Given food service workers often cannot afford adequate food despite preparing food
    When this contradiction becomes visible
    Then the protocol should help organize around food worker food security
    And advocate for meal provisions as standard for food workers
    And push for wages that enable workers to afford quality food
    And make visible the injustice of hungry people feeding others

  Scenario: Building worker power through industry-wide organizing
    Given individual workers and workplaces have limited power
    When workers organize across the industry
    Then the protocol should facilitate industry-wide organizing
    And support union drives and worker organization formation
    And coordinate collective action across workplaces
    And build worker power sufficient to transform industry conditions

  Scenario: Advocating for worker ownership and cooperative models
    Given current ownership structures extract from workers
    When workers want to explore alternative ownership models
    Then the protocol should provide information about worker cooperatives
    And connect workers interested in cooperative organizing
    And support transition toward worker ownership in food service
    And build examples of care-economy-aligned food business models

  Scenario: Participating in industry policy advocacy
    Given policy changes can transform industry conditions
    When legislation affecting food service workers is under consideration
    Then the protocol should alert workers to policy opportunities
    And facilitate participation in legislative advocacy
    And coordinate worker testimony and organizing for policy change
    And build political power for worker-supportive policy

  Scenario: Making visible that industry depends on worker care labor
    Given the food service industry depends entirely on workers' care labor
    And workers are serving essential human needs (nourishment and community)
    When the industry narrative treats workers as disposable
    Then the protocol should make visible workers' essential contributions
    And reframe food service as care work serving community flourishing
    And build consciousness that workers deserve dignity and fair compensation
    And transform industry culture from extraction to care economy alignment
