Feature: Neighborhood Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver
  As a caregiver needing neighborhood support and connection
  Operating at the neighborhood governance layer
  I want neighborhood care economy to provide practical support and social connection
  So that intensive caregiving doesn't result in isolation and unsupported burden

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the caregiver user "James" is registered in the system
    And James cares for David who has early-onset Alzheimer's
    And James lives in his neighborhood but is increasingly isolated
    And caregiving consumes most of James's time and energy
    And the neighborhood governance context is active
    And the neighborhood_elohim coordinates local care economy
    And James needs practical neighborhood support and human connection

  Scenario: Neighborhood awareness of caregiver situation and needs
    Given many neighbors may not know about James's caregiving burden
    And invisibility prevents neighbors from offering support
    When the neighborhood_elohim shares appropriate information
    Then neighbors should be aware James is providing intensive care
    And they should understand his situation without violating privacy
    And awareness should enable neighbors to offer help meaningfully
    And James should not be invisible in his own neighborhood
    And caregiver situation should be visible enough to enable support

  Scenario: Practical neighborhood support for isolated caregiver
    Given James cannot easily leave David alone
    And small practical tasks become difficult
    When neighbors offer practical support
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate helpful offers
    And neighbors could pick up groceries or prescriptions
    And they could help with yard work or home maintenance
    And they could check in and provide human connection
    And practical support should reduce James's isolation
    And neighborhood mutual aid should serve caregivers actively

  Scenario: Emergency backup support from trusted neighbors
    Given caregiving emergencies occur unexpectedly
    And James might need urgent help with David
    When the neighborhood_elohim coordinates emergency support
    Then it should identify trusted neighbors for backup
    And it should ensure neighbors are trained for basic support
    And emergency contacts should be readily available
    And neighborhood should provide safety net for crisis
    And James should have local emergency backup beyond 911

  Scenario: Respite visits from neighbors to prevent social isolation
    Given James is profoundly socially isolated by caregiving
    And he desperately needs human connection
    When neighbors provide respite visits
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate visiting schedules
    And neighbors could stay with David briefly while James takes walk
    And they could provide social connection for both James and David
    And brief respite periods should be regular, not just emergency
    And neighborhood should actively prevent caregiver isolation

  Scenario: Neighborhood care token recognition for caregiver contributions
    Given James contributes to community by caring for David
    And he's reducing burden on institutional care systems
    When neighborhood care economy evaluates contributions
    Then James should accumulate care tokens for caregiving work
    And neighborhood should recognize his care as community contribution
    And care tokens should give him standing to access support
    And caregiving should be valued within neighborhood economy
    And James should be able to access help based on his contributions

  Scenario: Neighborhood understanding prevents stigma around cognitive decline
    Given David's Alzheimer's may cause concerning behaviors
    And neighbors might not understand cognitive decline
    When the neighborhood_elohim provides education
    Then neighbors should understand Alzheimer's symptoms
    And they should respond with compassion, not fear
    And stigma around cognitive decline should be reduced
    And David should be treated with dignity in neighborhood
    And neighborhood should be safe and supportive for both James and David

  Scenario: Neighborhood respite network for caregiver breaks
    Given James needs regular breaks or he will burn out
    And formal respite care is expensive and hard to access
    When the neighborhood_elohim organizes respite network
    Then it should coordinate neighbors willing to provide respite
    And it should schedule regular respite periods for James
    And neighbors should be trained for basic Alzheimer's care
    And respite should be reliable and consistent
    And neighborhood should provide systematic respite support

  Scenario: Neighborhood meal support during caregiver crisis periods
    Given caregiving intensity varies with David's condition
    And James may have periods of extreme overwhelm
    When the neighborhood_elohim detects crisis conditions
    Then it should coordinate meal support from neighbors
    And meal delivery should be appropriate for David's dietary needs
    And food support should be dignified, not stigmatizing
    And neighborhood should provide practical crisis support
    And James should access help during overwhelming periods

  Scenario: Neighborhood walking companionship for caregiver well-being
    Given James needs exercise and fresh air for his own health
    And he cannot leave David alone for walks
    When neighbors offer companionship
    Then the neighborhood_elohim should coordinate walking support
    And neighbors could stay with David while James walks
    And they could accompany James and David together
    And regular walks should be protected for James's well-being
    And neighborhood should actively support caregiver health

  Scenario: Neighborhood technology support for overwhelmed caregiver
    Given James manages complex care coordination systems
    And technology problems become overwhelming when also caregiving
    When the neighborhood_elohim identifies tech-skilled neighbors
    Then neighbors should help with technology issues
    And they should support James with care coordination tech
    And technical support should reduce burden, not increase it
    And neighborhood should include practical technology assistance
    And James should access help when systems become overwhelming

  Scenario: Neighborhood boundaries respect caregiver capacity
    Given James has extremely limited capacity for neighborhood activities
    And well-meaning neighbors might make unsustainable demands
    When the neighborhood_elohim manages expectations
    Then neighbors should understand James cannot contribute labor currently
    And they should offer support without expecting reciprocation immediately
    And James's care work should be recognized as neighborhood contribution
    And neighborhood should not burden caregivers with additional demands
    And boundaries should protect James from overwhelming expectations

  Scenario: Neighborhood memorial preparation supports anticipatory grief
    Given David's condition is progressive and terminal
    And James experiences anticipatory grief constantly
    When the neighborhood_elohim recognizes grief support needs
    Then it should connect James to grief support resources
    And neighbors should be prepared to support through eventual loss
    And anticipatory grief should be recognized and honored
    And neighborhood should plan to support James through progressive loss
    And care relationships should extend through grief and beyond
