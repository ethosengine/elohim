Feature: Community Layer Value Recognition for Caregiver
  As a caregiver engaging with community care economy
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want community systems that recognize family caregiving as essential care work
  So that community care economy sustains family caregivers and values their contributions

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the caregiver user "James" is registered in the system
    And James provides intensive care for David (early-onset Alzheimer's)
    And James coordinates care for his mother (76)
    And James's care work is worth estimated $50k+/year professionally
    And the community governance context is active
    And the community_elohim coordinates care economy at scale
    And family caregivers provide $470 billion/year in invisible care nationally

  Scenario: Community recognition of family caregiving as professional-grade work
    Given James provides skilled care equivalent to professional nursing
    And his work is invisible because he cares for family
    When the community_elohim evaluates caregiving contributions
    Then James's care should be valued at professional rates
    And community should recognize family caregiving as essential infrastructure
    And care token accumulation should reflect professional-grade value
    And invisibility of family care should be systematically addressed
    And community care economy should make family caregiving visible

  Scenario: Community care economy supplements for reduced household income
    Given James's household income dropped from $80k to $40k due to caregiving
    And caregiving prevents full-time employment
    When the community_elohim assesses economic support needs
    Then care token supplements should be available based on need
    And community should provide financial support recognizing care work
    And support should be dignified, not stigmatizing like charity
    And care economy should function as economic justice system
    And caregivers should not face poverty due to care contributions

  Scenario: Community respite care accessible through care economy
    Given James needs regular respite to prevent burnout
    And formal respite care costs $20-30/hour he cannot afford
    When James accesses community respite resources
    Then his care token accumulation should subsidize respite costs
    And community should provide respite care at accessible rates
    And respite should be professional-quality and reliable
    And care economy should ensure caregivers get necessary breaks
    And community should invest in caregiver sustainability

  Scenario: Community caregiver support networks connect isolated caregivers
    Given James is profoundly isolated by intensive caregiving
    And connection to other caregivers is essential for survival
    When the community_elohim connects caregivers
    Then James should access support groups for Alzheimer's caregivers
    And he should connect with other sandwich generation caregivers
    And he should find LGBTQ+ caregiver community if desired
    And support networks should provide practical advice and emotional support
    And community should actively prevent caregiver isolation

  Scenario: Community medical equipment lending supported by care economy
    Given David needs increasing assistive equipment as disease progresses
    And purchasing equipment is financially impossible
    When James needs medical equipment
    Then the community_elohim should connect to equipment lending libraries
    And his care contributions should give standing to access equipment
    And borrowing should be dignified and based on care economy
    And community should pool medical resources for caregiver access
    And equipment access should reduce financial burden

  Scenario: Community education recognizes invisible care economy scale
    Given community members don't understand family caregiver reality
    And invisibility perpetuates lack of support
    When the community_elohim demonstrates care economy scale
    Then it should show family caregivers provide $470 billion/year nationally
    And it should quantify caregiving in local community specifically
    And community should recognize dependence on invisible care work
    And education should transform attitudes toward family caregiving
    And visibility should drive policy changes supporting caregivers

  Scenario: Community policy advocacy based on caregiver data
    Given caregivers need employment protections and support policies
    And policy requires data to demonstrate need
    When the community_elohim aggregates caregiver data
    Then it should demonstrate caregiving scope in community
    And data should support advocacy for caregiver leave policies
    And it should show economic impact of unsupported caregiving
    And community should advocate for caregivers at policy level
    And care economy data should drive systemic change

  Scenario: Community crisis support for caregiver emergencies
    Given caregiving crises can become tragedies quickly
    And James could reach complete burnout or medical emergency
    When the community_elohim detects caregiver crisis
    Then it should provide immediate crisis intervention
    And emergency respite care should be available immediately
    And medical support should be accessible for caregiver health
    And community should have safety net for caregiver collapse
    And crisis detection should prevent tragedy

  Scenario: Community food security for caregiver households
    Given James's household faces food insecurity on reduced income
    And care demands make food shopping difficult
    When the community_elohim assesses food security
    Then food assistance should be available through care economy
    And delivery should accommodate caregiver constraints
    And food should meet David's specialized nutritional needs
    And access should be dignified and based on care contributions
    And community should ensure caregiver households have food security

  Scenario: Community transportation support for medical appointments
    Given James must coordinate multiple medical appointments
    And transportation logistics are overwhelming
    When the community_elohim organizes transportation support
    Then volunteer drivers should be available for medical appointments
    And transportation should accommodate David's cognitive needs
    And scheduling should be reliable for multiple appointments
    And community should reduce transportation burden
    And medical access should not require James to manage everything alone

  Scenario: Community legal aid for caregiver navigation needs
    Given James needs advance directives, power of attorney, possibly guardianship
    And legal services are expensive and complex
    When the community_elohim connects to legal resources
    Then legal aid should be accessible based on care contributions
    And attorneys should understand caregiver-specific needs
    And legal navigation should be supported through care economy
    And community should ensure caregivers access legal protections
    And legal complexity should not be impossible barrier

  Scenario: Community future planning supports caregiver sustainability
    Given James's caregiving could last years or decades
    And he needs to build future care economy resources
    When James plans for long-term sustainability
    Then the community_elohim should track his accumulating care contributions
    And his care tokens should build toward future when he may need care
    And community should recognize caregiving as investment in mutual aid
    And care economy should function across decades, not just immediate needs
    And James should build care economy standing for his own future vulnerability
