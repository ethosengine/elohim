Feature: Educational Layer Value Literacy for Child
  As a child in the value scanner system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to develop genuine value literacy through guided practice
  So that I build care-based economic thinking for life

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the child user "Emma" is registered in the system
    And Emma is 8 years old in the Guided Autonomy phase
    And the educational governance context is active
    And pedagogical principles for ages 8-10 are configured
    And Emma's personal_agent uses Socratic teaching method
    And Emma is at concrete operations cognitive stage

  Scenario: Learning through Socratic questioning not direct instruction
    Given Emma is comparing two products
    And her personal_agent serves as teacher-guide
    When Emma seeks guidance on which to choose
    Then the agent should ask "What do you notice about these two options?"
    And the agent should follow up based on Emma's observations
    And the agent should ask "Which one do you think would work better for your family?"
    And direct instruction should be avoided
    And Emma should develop her own reasoning through inquiry
    And critical thinking should be built through question-based pedagogy
    And teaching should treat Emma as thinker, not rule-follower

  Scenario: Concrete operations stage supports numerical comparison
    Given Emma can handle basic math at age 8
    And she is developing numerical reasoning
    When Emma compares prices or quantities
    Then the personal_agent should support mathematical thinking
    And the agent should ask "How much money would we save?"
    And simple calculations should be scaffolded
    And Emma should practice applying math to real decisions
    And numerical literacy should be built through authentic use
    And abstract concepts should be grounded in concrete comparisons

  Scenario: Moral development supported through care-based choices
    Given Emma is at conventional morality stage (ages 7-11)
    And she is developing sense of right and wrong
    When Emma makes choices that affect others
    Then the personal_agent should highlight moral dimensions
    And the agent should ask "How will this choice affect Tommy?"
    And care ethics should be made explicit in decisions
    And Emma should develop moral reasoning through practice
    And value decisions should be framed as care decisions
    And moral development should be integrated with economic learning

  Scenario: Category formation applied to understanding value dimensions
    Given Emma is developing ability to categorize and classify
    And she can understand multiple attributes simultaneously
    When Emma evaluates products
    Then the personal_agent should help her categorize value types
    And the agent should present: nutritional value, environmental impact, care labor, price
    And Emma should learn to organize complexity through categories
    And cognitive development should support multi-dimensional analysis
    And value literacy should build on natural categorization abilities

  Scenario: Foundation for lifetime care economy thinking established
    Given Emma is forming foundational economic beliefs ages 8-10
    And early patterns shape lifelong thinking
    When Emma consistently makes care-based value decisions
    Then she should internalize resources are for stewardship
    And she should learn choices affect others' flourishing
    And she should understand care creates value
    And neural pathways for care economy should form
    And she should have alternative to consumer capitalism as baseline
    And this generation should grow up assuming care economy is normal

  Scenario: Learning value literacy, not just price comparison
    Given Emma is building complex understanding of value
    And value extends far beyond simple price
    When Emma uses the Value Scanner for education
    Then she should learn to see multiple value dimensions
    And nutritional value should be explored
    And environmental impact should be age-appropriately introduced
    And care labor embedded in production should be made visible
    And community benefit should be considered
    And she should learn to read complexity, not just price tags

  Scenario: Pedagogical approach adapts to individual learning pace
    Given Emma's development may vary from age averages
    And learning readiness differs across children
    When the personal_agent teaches value concepts
    Then instruction should adapt to Emma's actual capabilities
    And pacing should match her individual readiness
    And the system should observe comprehension signals
    And no child should be pushed beyond capacity
    And no child should be held back from what they're ready to learn
    And personalized learning should respect individual development

  Scenario: Safe environment for learning from mistakes
    Given Emma is practicing value literacy
    And mistakes are essential to learning
    When Emma makes a choice that doesn't work out well
    Then the experience should be treated as learning opportunity
    And her personal_agent should guide reflection: "How did that work out?"
    And no shame or punishment should be attached to mistakes
    And consequences should be educational, not harmful
    And judgment should be built through safe practice
    And error should be normalized as part of learning process

  Scenario: Building judgment before adolescence raises stakes
    Given Emma is practicing value decisions ages 8-10
    And adolescence will bring higher-stakes choices
    When Emma develops decision-making skills through scanner
    Then she should build capacity while consequences are manageable
    And judgment should be practiced in low-risk context
    And she should develop value literacy before teen years
    And safe practice should prepare her for Real Responsibility phase (11-13)
    And developmental progression should scaffold increasing autonomy
    And early practice should enable later capability

  Scenario: School curriculum integration supports value literacy
    Given Emma's school may integrate Value Scanner data
    And educational layer includes formal learning contexts
    When Emma's anonymized scanner data is shared with school (with family permission)
    Then data should support curriculum in nutrition, math, social studies
    And learning should be reinforced across contexts
    And family permission should be required for school integration
    And Emma's privacy should be protected in educational use
    And formal education should complement experiential learning
    And value literacy should be built across multiple contexts

  Scenario: Teaching that care work creates economic value
    Given traditional economics makes care work invisible
    And Emma is forming foundational economic understanding
    When Emma performs care labor through scanner decisions
    Then the system should explicitly teach care creates value
    And her personal_agent should say "Your stewardship helped your family"
    And care contributions should be valued concretely
    And she should learn caring for others is economically valuable
    And care economy framework should be established as baseline
    And she should understand care before being exposed to extraction economics

  Scenario: Educational design prevents consumer identity formation
    Given consumer capitalism targets children for conditioning
    And Emma is in critical identity formation years
    When Emma learns through the Value Scanner
    Then no gamification should train extraction thinking
    And no points systems should create consumption addiction
    And no rewards should condition acquisition behavior
    And identity should center on stewardship, not consumption
    And she should learn to see herself as contributor, not consumer
    And care-based identity should be cultivated intentionally

  Scenario: Accessibility features support diverse learning needs
    Given Emma may have varied learning needs
    And accessibility is required for equitable education
    When Emma uses educational features of the scanner
    Then multiple modalities should be available (visual, audio, text)
    And reading support should be provided as needed
    And math scaffolding should be accessible
    And voice guidance should be option
    And interface should serve children with diverse abilities
    And educational access should be universal

  Scenario: Learning contributes to collective knowledge without exploitation
    Given Emma's learning patterns generate educational data
    And this data could improve pedagogy for other children
    When Emma's anonymized learning data is collected
    Then it must only be used to improve educational outcomes
    And Emma's privacy must be absolutely protected
    And no commercial exploitation should occur
    And data should serve collective learning, not surveillance capitalism
    And educational data must never be monetized
    And community benefit must not compromise individual privacy

  Scenario: Environmental care literacy appropriate to concrete operations
    Given care economy extends to ecological relationships
    And Emma can understand concrete environmental concepts
    When Emma learns about environmental impact through scanner
    Then ecological care should be presented at age-appropriate level
    And the agent should say "This packaging can be recycled" (concrete)
    And abstract sustainability concepts should be avoided
    And connections between caring for people and planet should begin
    And Emma should develop environmental consciousness
    And ecological stewardship foundations should be laid for future development
