Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Person with Disabilities
  As a person with disabilities participating in family relationships
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want my autonomy respected and my contributions recognized within family
  So that I can engage as a full adult family member, not as dependent child or burden

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the person_with_disabilities user "Alex" is registered in the system
    And Alex is 35 years old with cerebral palsy
    And Alex has family relationships including parents and siblings
    And Alex lives independently but maintains connection to family
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim coordinates family care economy
    And family relationships involve complex dynamics around disability

  Scenario: Alex participates in family governance as full adult member
    Given Alex is an adult family member
    And some family might still treat Alex as dependent child
    When family decisions are made
    Then Alex should have equal voice to other adult family members
    And Alex's autonomy should be respected by the family_elohim
    And Alex's opinions should carry weight appropriate to an adult
    And infantilization patterns should be identified and countered
    And the system should structure Alex as competent adult
    And family should be prompted to respect Alex's sovereignty
    And Alex's full adulthood should be systematically affirmed

  Scenario: Reciprocal care flows challenge narrative of one-directional dependence
    Given family relationships often assume disabled people only receive care
    And Alex actually provides substantial care to family
    When the family_elohim tracks care contributions
    Then Alex's care work for family should be made visible
    And Alex provides emotional support, advice, practical help to family members
    And care should be recognized as flowing in multiple directions
    And the narrative that Alex only takes should be countered with data
    And family should see Alex as care contributor, not just recipient
    And reciprocity should be made undeniable through quantification
    And cultural assumptions should be challenged by visible reality

  Scenario: Family support coordinated without undermining Alex's independence
    Given Alex sometimes needs support from family members
    And family might conflate providing support with having authority
    When family provides assistance to Alex
    Then support should flow with full respect for Alex's autonomy
    And family should provide help Alex requests, not help they think Alex needs
    And Alex should maintain decision-making authority
    And the family_elohim should structure relationships to protect Alex's agency
    And offering help should never imply Alex is incapable
    And interdependence should be normalized, not pathologized
    And family support should strengthen, not undermine, Alex's independence

  Scenario: Alex's disability expertise recognized as valuable family knowledge
    Given Alex has deep expertise about disability, accessibility, and ableism
    And this knowledge benefits entire family
    When family engages with disability-related topics
    Then Alex should be recognized as the family expert
    And family should seek Alex's guidance on accessibility matters
    And Alex's advocacy work should be valued as contribution
    And Alex's perspective should shape family understanding
    And the family_elohim should position Alex as knowledge source
    And Alex's disability experience should be treated as expertise, not deficit
    And family should learn from Alex, not pity Alex

  Scenario: Family boundaries protect Alex from ableist assumptions
    Given family members might have internalized ableist beliefs
    And some might make assumptions about Alex's quality of life or capabilities
    When family interactions occur
    Then the family_elohim should help Alex maintain boundaries
    And it should support Alex in responding to ableist comments
    And it should document patterns of disrespect or boundary violations
    And Alex should have tools to protect themselves from family ableism
    And the system should recognize that family can be source of harm
    And Alex's right to distance from harmful family dynamics should be supported
    And protection should be available even within family relationships

  Scenario: Family gatherings consider accessibility proactively
    Given family events often occur in inaccessible spaces
    And accessibility is frequently an afterthought
    When family gatherings are planned
    Then the family_elohim should prompt organizers to consider accessibility
    And it should provide Alex tools to communicate access needs
    And venue accessibility should be verified before events
    And Alex should not have to repeatedly advocate for basic inclusion
    And family should understand that inaccessibility equals exclusion
    And accessible planning should become family norm
    And Alex should be able to participate fully in family life

  Scenario: Alex's life choices respected by family without ableist judgment
    Given Alex makes life choices that family might not understand
    And ableism might lead family to question Alex's decisions
    When Alex makes choices about work, living situation, relationships, etc.
    Then family should respect Alex's choices as they would any adult's
    And the family_elohim should affirm Alex's right to self-determination
    And disability should not be treated as reason to override Alex's autonomy
    And Alex should not have to justify choices more than non-disabled siblings
    And the protocol should protect Alex from family paternalism
    And Alex's sovereignty should be structurally defended
    And family should be prompted to examine their ableist assumptions

  Scenario: Family care token flows reflect Alex's substantial contributions
    Given Alex contributes significantly to family care economy
    And traditional family roles often render disabled people's contributions invisible
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Alex's emotional labor should accumulate tokens appropriately
    And Alex's advocacy improving accessibility benefits whole family
    And Alex's peer support to other disabled family members should be valued
    And care tokens should flow to Alex for contributions, not just from Alex as recipient
    And family economics should recognize Alex's care work explicitly
    And the data should challenge family narratives of Alex as burden
    And Alex's economic standing within family should reflect actual contributions

  Scenario: Family communication adapted for Alex's accessibility needs
    Given family uses various communication methods
    And some methods may not be accessible to Alex
    When family communicates
    Then the family_elohim should ensure Alex can participate fully
    And family should use accessible communication formats
    And Alex should not be excluded by inaccessible technology choices
    And family should be prompted to accommodate Alex's needs
    And accessibility should be automatic, not requested each time
    And Alex should have equal access to all family communication
    And the system should reduce Alex's communication barriers

  Scenario: Navigating family history of medical trauma
    Given Alex may have experienced medical trauma in childhood
    And family might have painful history around Alex's disability
    When family discusses disability-related topics
    Then the family_elohim should recognize potential trauma triggers
    And it should support Alex in managing difficult family dynamics
    And Alex should have tools to redirect unhelpful conversations
    And family should be prompted toward disability justice frameworks
    And the protocol should help family shift from medical to social model
    And Alex should be supported in processing family history
    And healing should be possible through better frameworks

  Scenario: Alex's chosen family recognized alongside biological family
    Given Alex may have close relationships in disability community
    And chosen family might be more supportive than biological family
    When the family_elohim defines family relationships
    Then it should include Alex's chosen family members
    And disability community bonds should be recognized as family
    And care flows with chosen family should be tracked and valued
    And Alex should be able to define their own family
    And the protocol should honor diverse family structures
    And biological family should not be privileged over chosen family
    And Alex's full support network should be acknowledged

  Scenario: Family privacy protects Alex from unwanted disclosure
    Given Alex's disability status is sensitive information
    And some family members might share Alex's private information
    When family members access shared family systems
    Then Alex should control what information family can access
    And the family_elohim should prevent unauthorized disclosure
    And Alex's medical information should never be shared without consent
    And family should not be able to discuss Alex's private matters in shared spaces
    And privacy violations should be prevented systematically
    And Alex should be protected from family gossip or oversharing
    And confidentiality should be enforced even within family

  Scenario: Family education about disability justice improves relationships
    Given family relationships improve when family understands disability better
    And many families lack disability justice frameworks
    When the family_elohim detects ableist patterns
    Then it should provide family members with educational resources
    And it should prompt family toward social model understanding
    And it should share disability culture and community perspectives
    And family should be invited to learn from Alex's expertise
    And education should be offered supportively, not punitively
    And the goal should be transforming family culture toward inclusion
    And better understanding should enable healthier family relationships
