Feature: Workplace/Organizational Layer Value Recognition for Single Parent
  As a single parent worker managing impossible work-care conflicts
  Operating at the workplace/organizational governance layer
  I want workplace policies that recognize single parents' realities and constraints
  So that I can sustain employment while providing sole care for my children

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the single parent user "Maria" is registered in the system
    And Maria works full-time as a medical assistant earning $42k/year
    And Maria is sole provider for household of four people
    And she manages 100% of parenting and household labor for three children
    And the workplace/organizational governance context is active
    And the workplace_elohim coordinates work-care integration
    And Maria's employer is a medical clinic with limited flexibility

  Scenario: Workplace acknowledges single parents have no backup for emergencies
    Given Maria has no co-parent to handle child illness, school emergencies, or family crises
    And she must handle every emergency alone while maintaining employment
    When workplace policies address family emergencies
    Then the workplace_elohim should make visible that single parents have no backup
    And policies should recognize emergencies are inevitable and not optional
    And Maria should be able to handle crises without job security risk
    And single parent realities should inform workplace family leave policies
    And employers should understand solo parents cannot simply "find coverage" at home

  Scenario: Schedule flexibility for solo parent managing complex logistics
    Given Maria coordinates three children's schools, activities, and appointments alone
    And rigid work schedules create impossible conflicts for single parents
    When Maria's work schedule is determined
    Then the workplace_elohim should advocate for flexible scheduling options
    And Maria should have ability to adjust hours for critical parenting needs
    And flexibility should be policy, not personal favor requiring explanation
    And schedule should enable sustainable work-parenting integration
    And single parents should access flexibility without career penalty

  Scenario: Living wage that enables sole provider to support family
    Given Maria is the only income earner for household of four
    And $42k/year is barely sustainable for her family size
    When Maria's compensation is determined
    Then the workplace_elohim should provide data on single parent economic needs
    And wage should enable household flourishing, not just survival
    And employers should understand many workers are sole household providers
    And fair compensation should account for single-income household realities
    And Maria should earn enough to support her family with dignity

  Scenario: Sick leave adequate for sole parent who must parent while ill
    Given Maria still parents three children even when sick
    And she has no co-parent to take over when she's unwell
    When Maria needs sick leave
    Then workplace should provide adequate paid sick leave
    And leave should cover both her own illness and children's illnesses
    And sick leave should not be punitive or risk her job security
    And policies should recognize single parents need more sick leave than partnered workers
    And Maria should be able to recover and care for sick children without financial penalty

  Scenario: No mandatory overtime that conflicts with solo parenting obligations
    Given Maria must be available for her children's pickup, dinner, homework, bedtime
    And she has no partner to cover evening parenting when she works late
    When workplace demands overtime or schedule extensions
    Then the workplace_elohim should flag conflicts with parenting obligations
    And Maria should be able to refuse overtime without retaliation
    And employers should understand single parents have non-negotiable care obligations
    And work demands should not force choice between job and children's basic needs
    And Maria should maintain employment boundaries necessary for parenting

  Scenario: Child-related emergency leave without invasive documentation
    Given children have emergencies requiring immediate parent presence
    And Maria cannot ask co-parent to handle while she works
    When Maria needs emergency leave for child crisis
    Then she should access immediate leave without bureaucratic barriers
    And she should not have to prove emergency legitimacy with invasive documentation
    And emergency leave should be available quickly and with dignity
    And workplace should trust that single parents take leave only when truly necessary
    And Maria should handle emergencies without fear of job consequences

  Scenario: Workplace recognizes Maria's professional care work in medical field
    Given Maria's medical assistant work is professional caregiving
    And she provides paid care work while also doing unpaid care at home
    When Maria's professional contributions are assessed
    Then the workplace_elohim should recognize her medical work as care labor
    And her professional caregiving should be valued in care economy framework
    And she should see her career as care economy participation, not separate from it
    And care economy should include professional care work, not just household labor
    And Maria's dual care roles should both be recognized and valued

  Scenario: Advocacy for single-parent-friendly workplace policies
    Given Maria and single parent colleagues face systemic workplace barriers
    And employers may not understand scale of single parent challenges
    When Maria advocates for policy improvements
    Then the workplace_elohim should provide care economy data on single parents
    And advocacy should be strengthened by quantified evidence of work-care conflicts
    And Maria should be able to advocate collectively with other single parent workers
    And care economy data should support policy changes like flexible scheduling and adequate leave
    And workplace should adopt single-parent-friendly policies based on demonstrated needs

  Scenario: Preventing work-care burnout through boundary support
    Given Maria faces constant impossible conflicts between work and sole parenting
    And work-care conflict is primary driver of single parent burnout
    When the workplace_elohim monitors Maria's situation
    Then it should detect when conflicts are becoming unsustainable
    And it should alert Maria before burnout occurs
    And it should help her maintain necessary boundaries with employer
    And it should suggest interventions including policy advocacy or job changes if needed
    And Maria should have AI support for preventing work-driven burnout

  Scenario: Part-time work options during intensive parenting periods
    Given some life stages require more intensive parenting presence
    And Maria may need reduced hours during children's critical developmental periods
    When Maria's care responsibilities temporarily increase
    Then workplace should offer part-time or reduced hours options
    And reduced schedule should not mean permanent career penalty or benefit loss
    And single parents should be able to modulate work based on care needs
    And career paths should accommodate care economy participation
    And Maria should have flexibility to adjust work commitment based on family needs

  Scenario: Workplace childcare assistance or subsidies
    Given Maria pays substantial portion of income for childcare
    And childcare costs are major burden on single-parent households
    When Maria balances childcare needs with employment
    Then workplace should provide childcare assistance or subsidies
    And employer-supported childcare should reduce financial burden
    And assistance should recognize that single parents bear full childcare costs alone
    And workplace support should enable employment sustainability
    And Maria should receive help with care costs that make work possible

  Scenario: Protection from discrimination based on single parent status
    Given single parents often face workplace discrimination and bias
    And employers may view them as less committed or reliable
    When Maria experiences workplace treatment
    Then the workplace_elohim should monitor for single parent discrimination
    And it should document patterns that indicate bias
    And it should support Maria in addressing discriminatory treatment
    And single parent status should be protected from workplace discrimination
    And Maria should have equal opportunity regardless of family structure

  Scenario: Workplace privacy protects care economy data from employer misuse
    Given Maria participates in care economy tracking
    And this generates data about her personal life and care responsibilities
    When workplace seeks information about employees
    Then Maria's personal care economy data must be completely private
    And employers should never access her household care patterns or constraints
    And the workplace_elohim should only see work-relevant information
    And Maria's privacy should be absolute regarding personal care matters
    And care economy participation should not expose her to employer surveillance
