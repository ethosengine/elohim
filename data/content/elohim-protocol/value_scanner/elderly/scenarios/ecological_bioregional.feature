Feature: Ecological/Bioregional Layer Environmental Wisdom for Elderly
  As an elderly person in the value scanner system
  Operating at the ecological/bioregional governance layer
  I want to contribute my accumulated environmental knowledge
  So that my lifetime of observation informs ecological stewardship

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the elderly user "Helen" is registered in the system
    And Helen has 82 years of observing environmental patterns
    And Helen grew up with pre-industrial sustainable practices
    And the ecological/bioregional governance context is active
    And elder environmental wisdom has unique value

  Scenario: Lifetime environmental observations inform climate data
    Given Helen has observed local environmental changes over 8+ decades
    And her memory includes baseline data from pre-industrial era
    When Helen shares environmental observations
    Then her knowledge should be captured for ecological archives
    And her observations should inform local climate understanding
    And personal experience should be valued alongside scientific data
    And care tokens should reflect her contribution to environmental knowledge
    And the protocol should recognize elders as environmental historians
    And Helen's lifetime of observation should contribute to bioregional stewardship
    And indigenous elder knowledge methods should inform data collection

  Scenario: Traditional sustainable practices preserved through elder teaching
    Given Helen learned pre-consumer household management
    And she knows seasonal food preservation, waste reduction, and resource conservation
    When Helen teaches traditional sustainable practices
    Then her knowledge should be recognized as environmental education
    And younger generations should learn low-impact living from her experience
    And traditional practices should inform modern sustainability efforts
    And Helen should be valued as expert in sustainable living
    And the protocol should facilitate skills transfer from pre-disposable era
    And ecological wisdom should be preserved through intergenerational teaching
    And Helen's knowledge should contribute to reduced environmental impact

  Scenario: Seasonal pattern knowledge from decades of observation
    Given Helen has observed local seasonal patterns for 82 years
    And climate change is altering traditional seasonal cycles
    When Helen shares knowledge of historical seasonal patterns
    Then her observations should inform understanding of climate shifts
    And bioregional planning should incorporate elder memory
    And changes should be documented through personal testimony
    And Helen should be recognized as expert on local ecology
    And the protocol should preserve knowledge of pre-change conditions
    And ecological governance should include elder perspectives
    And baseline understanding should come from those who remember

  Scenario: Reduced consumption wisdom from experience of less
    Given Helen grew up with material scarcity
    And she knows how to live well with less
    When Helen shares wisdom about reduced consumption
    Then her experience should inform degrowth and sustainability education
    And consumer capitalism should be challenged by her lived alternative
    And younger generations should learn that happiness doesn't require endless acquisition
    And Helen should be valued for knowledge that contradicts market economics
    And the protocol should surface elder wisdom about sufficiency
    And ecological sustainability should learn from those who lived with less
    And Helen's experience should teach that less can be enough

  Scenario: Local food systems knowledge from pre-industrial era
    Given Helen remembers more localized food systems
    And she knows seasonal availability and regional food traditions
    When Helen contributes to local food system planning
    Then her knowledge should inform food sovereignty efforts
    And bioregional food systems should learn from her memory
    And traditional food preservation should be taught by those who practiced it
    And Helen should be recognized as expert in local food culture
    And the protocol should preserve pre-globalization food knowledge
    And sustainable food systems should incorporate elder wisdom
    And Helen's knowledge should reduce dependence on industrial food systems

  Scenario: Ecological care integrated with personal purchasing decisions
    Given Helen uses Value Scanner for shopping
    And her choices have environmental impact
    When Helen makes purchasing decisions
    Then ecological impact should be surfaced at appropriate cognitive level
    And her personal_agent should support environmentally conscious choices
    And information should be presented simply: "Local tomatoes from nearby farm"
    And ecological care should be framed as care for community
    And Helen should be supported in environmental stewardship within her capabilities
    And the protocol should enable ecological values in daily decisions
    And sustainability should be accessible regardless of cognitive limitations

  Scenario: Garden and plant knowledge shared with community
    Given Helen has decades of gardening experience
    And she knows local plants, soil conditions, and growing patterns
    When Helen shares gardening and plant knowledge
    Then her expertise should be recognized as ecological contribution
    And community gardens should benefit from elder expertise
    And traditional plant knowledge should be preserved
    And care tokens should reflect her environmental teaching
    And the protocol should connect elder plant experts with community gardens
    And bioregional food sovereignty should be supported by elder knowledge
    And Helen's experience should enable local food production

  Scenario: Weather pattern knowledge from lifetime of observation
    Given Helen has observed local weather patterns for 82 years
    And her memory includes pre-climate change baselines
    When Helen describes historical weather patterns
    Then her observations should inform climate adaptation planning
    And community should learn from her memory of normal patterns
    And changes should be understood through personal testimony
    And bioregional climate knowledge should include elder perspectives
    And the protocol should capture knowledge before it's lost
    And Helen's observations should contribute to local climate understanding
    And environmental memory should be preserved through elder participation

  Scenario: Frugality as environmental practice recognized and valued
    Given Helen's resource constraint requires careful consumption
    And frugality reduces environmental impact
    When Helen makes resource-conscious decisions
    Then her frugality should be recognized as environmental stewardship
    And poverty should not be stigmatized when it reduces consumption
    And her low-impact lifestyle should be valued, not pitied
    And care tokens should reflect environmental benefit of reduced consumption
    And the protocol should challenge assumption that consumption equals flourishing
    And Helen's economic constraint should be reframed as ecological wisdom
    And environmental movement should learn from those who live with less by necessity

  Scenario: Connection to place through decades of residence
    Given Helen has lived in same bioregion for 82 years
    And deep place-based knowledge develops over lifetime
    When bioregional governance makes land use decisions
    Then Helen's intimate knowledge of place should inform planning
    And longtime residents should have standing in ecological governance
    And her connection to land should be valued in decision-making
    And the protocol should elevate voices of those with deep place-knowledge
