Feature: Educational Layer Value Literacy for Preteen
  As a preteen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want my real-world care responsibilities to be recognized as sophisticated learning
  So that my applied capabilities are valued academically and I develop advanced stewardship skills

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the preteen user "Marcus" is registered in the system
    And Marcus is 12 years old in the Real Responsibility phase
    And the educational governance context is active
    And Marcus applies sophisticated skills through household management
    And educational institutions can integrate real-world learning

  Scenario: Real-world household management recognized as applied learning
    Given Marcus manages complex household operations
    And he applies math, nutrition science, planning, and resource management
    When Marcus's scanner usage is analyzed educationally
    Then his applied skills should be recognized as sophisticated learning
    And the educational system should value real-world capability
    And his household work should qualify for academic recognition
    And applied learning should be weighted alongside traditional academics
    And his competencies should be documented and credentialed
    And practical stewardship should have educational value

  Scenario: Developing abstract thinking through real economic complexity
    Given Marcus is in developmental phase of emerging abstract thought
    And he manages genuinely complex resource coordination
    When Marcus plans meals and budgets across time
    Then he should be developing advanced cognitive capabilities
    And abstract concepts like opportunity cost should be learned through application
    And systems thinking should develop through real experience
    And the personal_agent should support abstract reasoning development
    And complex adult work should accelerate cognitive maturation
    And educational scaffolding should support his emerging abstraction

  Scenario: Nutritional science learned through responsibility for health
    Given Marcus is responsible for his and Keisha's nutrition
    And adequate nutrition requires scientific understanding
    When Marcus makes food choices
    Then he should be learning applied nutritional science
    And the personal_agent should teach nutrition in context
    And he should understand macronutrients, vitamins, balanced diet
    And learning should be motivated by real care responsibility
    And nutritional education should be deeper than typical age 12 curriculum
    And his care work should accelerate domain-specific learning

  Scenario: Mathematical skills developed through budget management
    Given Marcus manages $75 weekly budget across multiple constraints
    And budgeting requires sophisticated mathematical thinking
    When Marcus allocates resources across needs
    Then he should be learning applied mathematics
    And he should practice percentage calculations, unit pricing, budgeting
    And math should be learned through authentic application
    And his mathematical capabilities should exceed typical age-level expectations
    And the personal_agent should reinforce mathematical concepts
    And care economy should provide rich mathematical learning environment

  Scenario: Planning and executive function skills from complex coordination
    Given Marcus coordinates meals across week
    And he manages inventory, shopping lists, multi-store trips
    When Marcus exercises planning capabilities
    Then his executive function should be developing rapidly
    And he should be learning advanced planning and organization
    And time management and future orientation should develop
    And working memory and cognitive flexibility should be exercised
    And the personal_agent should support executive function development
    And real responsibility should build sophisticated planning capacity

  Scenario: Alternative educational pathways honor real-world capability
    Given Marcus has demonstrated sophisticated stewardship
    And traditional school may not capture his capabilities
    When educational pathways are considered
    Then alternative credentials should recognize his applied skills
    And competency-based advancement should be available
    And his household management should qualify for advanced placement
    And educational system should honor multiple forms of intelligence
    And practical capability should open doors to opportunity
    And care economy should create pathways beyond traditional academics

  Scenario: Learning economic systems through lived experience
    Given Marcus navigates real economic constraints daily
    And he experiences market systems, pricing, scarcity directly
    When Marcus develops economic understanding
    Then he should learn economics through authentic participation
    And he should understand supply and demand through shopping
    And he should grasp market failures through food desert experience
    And economic theory should be grounded in lived reality
    And his understanding should be deeper than abstract classroom learning
    And care economy should provide superior economic education

  Scenario: Moral and ethical development through care responsibility
    Given Marcus makes decisions affecting others' wellbeing
    And he balances competing needs with limited resources
    When Marcus exercises moral reasoning
    Then he should be developing sophisticated ethical thinking
    And he should understand fairness, reciprocity, and justice
    And moral development should accelerate through real responsibility
    And care ethics should be learned through practice
    And his moral maturation should advance beyond typical age expectations
    And care economy should support healthy moral development

  Scenario: Integration with school curriculum where beneficial
    Given Marcus's real-world learning is substantial
    And school integration could recognize his capabilities
    When Marcus grants permission for school integration
    Then the Value Scanner could share relevant learning data
    And schools could award credit for applied learning
    And his care contributions could supplement traditional coursework
    And integration should benefit Marcus academically
    And his consent and privacy should be absolute requirements
    And school recognition should honor his real-world competence

  Scenario: Educational support targeted to preteen's actual learning needs
    Given Marcus has gaps in some areas and advanced skills in others
    And his education should serve his whole development
    When educational resources are allocated
    Then support should target his actual needs, not age assumptions
    And he should receive advanced instruction in areas of strength
    And he should get support in areas where household burden limits learning
    And education should be personalized to his unique situation
    And the system should ensure his care burden doesn't limit his education
    And he should have full educational opportunity despite responsibilities

  Scenario: Scholarship eligibility based on demonstrated stewardship
    Given Marcus demonstrates exceptional capability and commitment
    And scholarships should go to deserving students
    When scholarship decisions are made
    Then Marcus's household stewardship should be powerful evidence
    And his care contributions should qualify as exceptional achievement
    And community should invest in young people proving their capability
    And care economy framework should influence scholarship criteria
    And his real-world responsibility should be valued over traditional metrics
    And educational opportunity should flow to those demonstrating care

  Scenario: Learning resource management as life skill
    Given Marcus manages complex household resources
    And resource stewardship is critical life skill
    When Marcus practices resource management
    Then he should be learning sophisticated stewardship
    And he should understand budgeting, planning, optimization
    And he should develop skills most people don't learn until adulthood
    And his education should include practical life competencies
    And resource management should be recognized as valuable learning
    And care economy should teach skills for thriving under constraint
