Feature: Family Layer Value Recognition for Preteen
  As a preteen in the value scanner system
  Operating at the family governance layer
  I want my substantial care contributions to be visible to my family
  So that I am recognized as a junior partner in family governance while preventing parentification damage

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the preteen user "Marcus" is registered in the system
    And Marcus is part of a family with mother Sarah and sister Keisha (age 7)
    And the family governance context is active
    And the family_elohim is coordinating family care economy
    And Marcus operates as junior partner in family governance
    And Sarah works two jobs with limited availability

  Scenario: Preteen's care work made visible with appropriate recognition
    Given Marcus has completed weekly grocery shopping
    And he has managed budget, nutrition, and meal planning
    When the family_elohim processes Marcus's contributions
    Then his care work should be visible on family dashboard
    And Sarah should receive specific recognition prompts
    And the prompt should detail "Marcus managed $75 budget, maintained 92% nutrition, planned 21 meals"
    And care tokens should reflect genuine economic value of his work
    And recognition should communicate that this is substantial labor
    And Sarah should be prompted to acknowledge his capability
    And Marcus should feel valued as major family contributor

  Scenario: Operating as junior partner in family governance
    Given Marcus makes real decisions about family resources
    And Sarah maintains ultimate parental authority
    When family governance decisions are made
    Then Marcus should be treated as junior partner, not dependent
    And his judgment should be increasingly trusted
    And the family_elohim should coordinate their partnership
    And Marcus's autonomy should grow with demonstrated capability
    And Sarah should maintain oversight without micromanaging
    And the balance should reflect his developmental stage
    And partnership model should prevent both parentification and infantilization

  Scenario: Mother's oversight calibrated to preteen's capability
    Given Sarah works two jobs with limited time
    And she needs to trust Marcus while maintaining responsibility
    When Sarah monitors Marcus's scanner usage
    Then she should have full visibility into his activities
    And the family_elohim should alert her when Marcus needs support
    And she should be informed of nutrition concerns or budget crises
    And routine successes should be summarized to build her confidence
    And the system should help her calibrate autonomy levels appropriately
    And she should not experience constant anxiety about delegating responsibility
    And trust should be built through visible competence

  Scenario: Care for sibling recognized without enabling parentification
    Given Marcus cares for Keisha age 7
    And he manages her meals and nutritional needs
    When Marcus makes care decisions for Keisha
    Then his care work should be tracked by family_elohim
    And the system should recognize legitimate care contributions
    And it should also watch for parentification damage
    And Keisha should be prompted to appreciate Marcus's work
    And the protocol should prevent Keisha from taking Marcus for granted
    And family_elohim should help maintain sibling dynamics alongside care reality
    And Marcus should be supported, not exploited

  Scenario: Tracking nutritional needs across family members
    Given Marcus is responsible for feeding himself and Keisha
    And Keisha has specific dietary needs and preferences
    When Marcus plans meals and shops
    Then the personal_agent should track both their nutritional requirements
    And it should alert Marcus to Keisha's needs: "Keisha needs more iron this week"
    And it should help him find affordable foods that meet her requirements
    And age-appropriate nutrition for both should be maintained
    And Marcus should have tools to ensure Keisha's healthy development
    And nutritional tracking should prevent inadequate diet

  Scenario: Family care tokens reflect preteen's substantial contributions
    Given the family participates in care token economy
    And Marcus performs significant household labor
    When family care tokens are calculated
    Then Marcus's contributions should be valued at realistic rates
    And tokens should reflect that his work would be compensated if adult performed it
    And family care token total should include his contributions
    And tokens should qualify family for community resource access
    And Marcus's demonstrated stewardship should be evidence of family capability
    And care economy should channel support to families like Marcus's

  Scenario: Preventing household stress from breaking family bonds
    Given Sarah is stretched thin across two jobs
    And Marcus carries substantial household responsibility
    When family stress levels are high
    Then the family_elohim should monitor for relationship strain
    And it should facilitate communication between Marcus and Sarah
    And it should prompt Sarah to recognize Marcus's work
    And it should connect family to support resources before crisis
    And the protocol should prevent stress from damaging their bond
    And care visibility should make burden manageable
    And support should flow to prevent family breakdown

  Scenario: Coordinating care across limited parental availability
    Given Sarah's work schedule limits her availability
    And Marcus manages daily household operations
    When coordination is needed between them
    Then the family_elohim should facilitate asynchronous communication
    And Sarah should be able to provide guidance during her available hours
    And Marcus should be able to request help when needed
    And the system should ensure Sarah stays informed despite time constraints
    And coordination should happen efficiently without constant interruption
    And their partnership should function despite scheduling challenges

  Scenario: Budget crisis triggers appropriate intervention
    Given Marcus manages $75 weekly budget
    And unexpected expenses could create crisis
    When budget becomes unsustainable
    Then the family_elohim should alert Sarah immediately
    And it should connect family to emergency resources
    And crisis intervention should preserve Marcus's dignity
    And the system should prevent budget failure from becoming catastrophic
    And support should be framed through care economy, not charity
    And Marcus should not feel responsible for systemic poverty

  Scenario: Family decision making includes preteen's substantial input
    Given Marcus has real knowledge of household needs and constraints
    And he manages daily household operations
    When family decisions about resources are made
    Then Marcus's input should carry genuine weight
    And his knowledge should inform family planning
    And the family_elohim should surface his insights to Sarah
    And his voice should be respected as informed perspective
    And family governance should reflect that he has legitimate standing
    And his participation should be meaningful, not token

  Scenario: Preserving developmentally appropriate family structure
    Given Marcus has adult-level responsibilities
    And he is still a 12-year-old child
    When family dynamics are shaped by care economy
    Then the family_elohim should work to preserve appropriate boundaries
    And Marcus should not become de facto parent
    And Sarah should remain ultimate authority and protector
    And age-appropriate childhood should be preserved where possible
    And the protocol should prevent role reversal damage
    And family structure should remain as healthy as circumstances allow

  Scenario: Recognition prompts build mother-son relationship
    Given Sarah has limited time with Marcus
    And their relationship could be strained by her absence and his burden
    When the family_elohim generates recognition prompts
    Then prompts should facilitate positive connection moments
    And Sarah should be given specific appreciations to express
    And Marcus should receive recognition from Sarah, not just system
    And their relationship should be strengthened by care visibility
    And prompts should create opportunities for bonding
    And love should be communicated despite difficult circumstances
