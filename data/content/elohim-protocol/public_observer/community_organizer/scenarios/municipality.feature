Feature: Municipal Coalition Building for Community Organizer
  As a community organizer in the public_observer system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want to mobilize multi-community coalitions for citywide policy campaigns
  So that collective power holds municipal government accountable to residents

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the community_organizer user is registered in the system
    And the municipality governance context is active

  Scenario: Organizer identifies budget justice organizing opportunity
    Given city council will vote on annual budget in three weeks
    And proposed cuts affect services in low-income neighborhoods
    When the Observer surfaces the organizing opportunity
    Then the organizer receives early alert with enough time to organize
    And sees which communities are most affected by cuts
    And gets analysis of budget trade-offs and alternatives
    And identifies decision points where testimony will have impact
    And three weeks allows for education, coalition building, and mobilization

  Scenario: Organizer builds cross-neighborhood budget justice coalition
    Given parents care about after-school programs being cut
    And seniors need meal delivery services maintained
    And workers depend on subsidized transit
    When the organizer uses Observer to identify alignment
    Then they see all three groups affected by same budget priorities
    And facilitate coordination across five neighborhoods
    And maintain shared information base on budget impacts
    And coordinate 100 residents for budget hearing testimony
    And diverse communities unite around shared municipal interests

  Scenario: Organizer generates accessible materials for citywide campaign
    Given the coalition is campaigning against developer tax breaks
    And needs to explain complex tax increment financing to residents
    When the organizer requests education materials from Observer
    Then they receive plain-language explanation of TIF mechanics
    And see actual dollar flows (who benefits, who pays)
    And get talking points for testimony and media
    And access fact-checking data to counter developer claims
    And technical policy becomes accessible community education

  Scenario: Organizer holds city council accountable for campaign promises
    Given council member promised affordable housing support during campaign
    And the organizer's coalition delivered volunteer support and votes
    When the council member votes on housing policy
    Then the Observer tracks their votes against commitments
    And shows the organizer their complete voting record
    And provides evidence for accountability conversations
    And makes politician's record visible to organized constituents
    And electoral support creates ongoing accountability relationship

  Scenario: Organizer coordinates testimony from diverse coalition members
    Given coalition spans four languages and six neighborhoods
    And members work different shifts limiting meeting availability
    When the organizer uses Observer for testimony coordination
    Then members access testimony guidelines in their languages
    And sign up for speaking slots that work with their schedules
    And share testimony drafts for peer feedback asynchronously
    And arrive at city council with coordinated powerful messages
    And coalition shows municipal government the breadth and depth of community power
