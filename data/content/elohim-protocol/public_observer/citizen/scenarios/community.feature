Feature: Community Civic Democracy for Citizen
  As a citizen in the public_observer system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to participate in neighborhood decisions without overwhelming time commitment
  So that I can shape my community while managing work and family responsibilities

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the citizen user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active

  Scenario: Citizen receives time-efficient community meeting summary
    Given a neighborhood council meeting occurred last night
    And the citizen has indicated interest in local amenities
    When the citizen checks their morning brief
    Then they see a 3-minute summary of key decisions
    And they see plain-language explanations of policy changes
    And they are notified only about decisions affecting their stated interests
    And they can submit async feedback on decisions
    And their time commitment is under 15 minutes

  Scenario: Citizen discovers coalition around shared community concern
    Given 14 neighbors are concerned about playground safety
    And the citizen has reported the same concern
    When the Public Observer detects the alignment pattern
    Then the citizen receives an opt-in coalition notification
    And they can coordinate with other concerned residents
    And they see aggregated data on playground conditions
    And they can participate in coordinated advocacy
    And isolation becomes collective action

  Scenario: Citizen tracks accountability for neighborhood commitments
    Given the community council promised playground repairs in 60 days
    And the commitment was made during a public meeting
    When 60 days pass
    Then the Observer alerts the citizen about the deadline
    And tracks whether repairs were completed
    And provides evidence for accountability conversations
    And prevents institutional forgetting of commitments
    And democracy includes follow-through tracking

  Scenario: Citizen accesses community resources without attending meetings
    Given the citizen works evening shifts
    And cannot attend 7 PM community meetings in person
    When community decisions are being made
    Then they can review asynchronous meeting summaries
    And submit positions via the app during lunch break
    And join key decision moments virtually
    And participate meaningfully in 15 minutes vs 3 hours
    And working-class participation barriers are reduced

  Scenario: Citizen evaluates development proposal affecting neighborhood
    Given a developer proposes new construction in their neighborhood
    And claims it will "bring community benefits"
    When the citizen reviews the Observer analysis
    Then they see actual value flows (who benefits, who pays)
    And view the developer's track record from past projects
    And understand infrastructure impacts (traffic, services, green space)
    And can challenge claims with evidence not just emotion
    And make informed decisions about supporting or opposing
