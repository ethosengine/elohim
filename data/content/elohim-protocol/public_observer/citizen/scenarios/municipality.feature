Feature: Municipal Civic Democracy for Citizen
  As a citizen in the public_observer system
  Operating at the municipality governance layer
  I want to engage meaningfully with city decisions without policy expertise
  So that democracy works for working people with limited time

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the citizen user is registered in the system
    And the municipality governance context is active

  Scenario: Citizen understands city budget trade-offs
    Given the city council is deciding the annual budget
    And a 300-page budget document was released
    When the citizen reviews the Observer summary
    Then they see clear spending priorities in plain language
    And understand which neighborhoods get infrastructure investment
    And view trade-offs between services (parks vs roads vs libraries)
    And can submit position on budget priorities in 10 minutes
    And complex civic decisions become comprehensible

  Scenario: Citizen detects politician voting pattern inconsistency
    Given a council member claims to support affordable housing
    And the citizen cares about housing affordability
    When the Observer tracks voting records over time
    Then the citizen sees the council member voted against 5 housing measures
    And approved tax breaks for luxury development
    And observes patterns vs rhetoric divergence
    And can hold officials accountable in elections
    And political theater becomes visible

  Scenario: Citizen participates in zoning decision with real-time context
    Given a city council meeting is discussing zoning changes
    And the citizen is following virtually during dinner
    When officials and developers make claims
    Then the Observer provides real-time fact-checking
    And shows what "efficient development" actually means for residents
    And calculates community costs hidden in presentations
    And surfaces conflicts of interest (donations, relationships)
    And informed participation happens in real-time

  Scenario: Citizen forms coalition across municipal issue areas
    Given 230 families are losing time to bus delays
    And 47 teachers are concerned about school overcrowding
    And both issues stem from municipal transportation budget
    When the Observer detects the pattern connection
    Then citizens see the larger civic context
    And can coordinate with teachers and other affected groups
    And build more powerful coalition across stakeholder types
    And isolated concerns become coordinated advocacy
    And cross-issue patterns surface organically

  Scenario: Citizen verifies municipal service delivery claims
    Given city officials claim streets are maintained equitably
    And the citizen's neighborhood has persistent potholes
    When the Observer tracks service delivery patterns
    Then the citizen sees which neighborhoods receive infrastructure investment
    And compares response times across different areas
    And identifies disparities in municipal services
    And presents evidence for accountability demands
    And equitable service delivery becomes measurable
