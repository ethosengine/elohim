Feature: Municipal Parent Advocacy for Children's Needs
  As a parent in the public_observer system
  Operating at the municipal governance layer
  I want to influence municipal decisions affecting my children's wellbeing
  So that city policies support children's safety, health, development, and opportunity

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the parent user is registered in the system
    And the parent has linked their children's schools, routes, and activities
    And the municipal governance context is active

  Scenario: Parent connects municipal budget to school funding
    Given the municipality is finalizing annual budget priorities
    And the parent doesn't understand how city budget affects schools
    When the parent reviews Observer's municipal-education analysis
    Then they see how city tax decisions impact school district funding
    And understand library budget cuts reduce children's book access
    And learn recreation spending affects afterschool program availability
    And municipal decisions connect to children's educational resources
    And parent advocacy expands to city-level budget priorities

  Scenario: Parent challenges development affecting school capacity
    Given a developer proposes 300-unit residential development
    And claims it will "strengthen the community and tax base"
    When the parent reviews Observer's school capacity analysis
    Then they see 180 new students projected from the development
    And learn the nearest elementary school is already over capacity
    And understand no new school facilities are planned
    And view developer's track record on past school impact promises
    And can challenge development approval with child-impact data

  Scenario: Parent advocates for safe routes to school infrastructure
    Given the parent's child walks to school along unsafe streets
    And lacks sidewalks and safe crossings for two blocks
    When the parent reviews municipal transportation budget
    Then they see $4M allocated for downtown streetscape improvements
    And learn zero dollars budgeted for school route safety
    And connect with other parents whose children walk same routes
    And present coordinated testimony at city council meeting
    And municipal infrastructure priorities include children's safety

  Scenario: Parent tracks municipal library service commitments
    Given the city council promised to restore library weekend hours
    And the parent's children depend on library for homework and programs
    When three months pass without weekend hours being restored
    Then the Observer alerts parent about the broken commitment
    And provides evidence from the original council promise
    And shows which council members voted for the restoration
    And parent can demand accountability for family-serving commitments
    And municipal promises to families persist despite turnover

  Scenario: Parent evaluates city's childcare infrastructure crisis
    Given the parent struggles to find affordable childcare
    And municipal zoning rules restrict home-based childcare
    When the parent reviews Observer's childcare access analysis
    Then they see municipality has 1 childcare slot per 4 children
    And understand zoning restrictions reduce supply
    And learn neighboring cities changed zoning to expand access
    And discover other parents facing same childcare crisis
    And parent advocacy targets municipal policy barriers

  Scenario: Parent opposes park closure affecting children's play space
    Given the municipality proposes closing neighborhood park
    And selling land to developer "to increase tax revenue"
    When the parent reviews Observer's park access analysis
    Then they see this eliminates closest play space for 400 children
    And understand remaining parks are across dangerous intersections
    And view data on child physical activity and green space access
    And connect with pediatricians concerned about children's health
    And parent advocacy preserves children's play infrastructure

  Scenario: Parent discovers coalition for youth recreation programs
    Given municipal budget cuts threaten youth sports and rec programs
    And the parent's child participates in city soccer league
    When the Observer detects 180 parents whose children use these programs
    Then parents form rapid coalition to defend youth programs
    And present coordinated data on program participation and benefits
    And show economic value of city programs vs private alternatives
    And municipal budget priorities respond to organized parent power
    And youth recreation programs are preserved

  Scenario: Parent challenges traffic safety near schools
    Given traffic speeds and volume near the school create danger
    And the parent has witnessed multiple near-miss incidents
    When the parent reviews Observer's traffic safety data
    Then they see documented speeding violations near school hours
    And learn which other schools have traffic calming measures
    And understand city transportation department can install measures
    And coordinate with school principal and other parents
    And municipal traffic safety includes school zone protection

  Scenario: Parent connects development pattern to school overcrowding
    Given the parent's child attends chronically overcrowded school
    And wonders why enrollment keeps increasing
    When the parent reviews Observer's municipal development history
    Then they see 5 major residential developments approved in 3 years
    And learn developers paid minimal school impact fees
    And understand city approved housing without ensuring school capacity
    And systematic pattern of municipal decisions harming education becomes visible
    And parent advocacy targets growth management policies

  Scenario: Parent advocates for municipal climate action affecting children
    Given extreme heat days close schools and cancel outdoor activities
    And the parent worries about children's future climate impacts
    When the parent reviews municipal climate adaptation plans
    Then they see schools lack air conditioning for heat waves
    And learn city has no strategy for protecting children's health
    And understand children are most vulnerable to climate impacts
    And connect with other parents concerned about children's futures
    And municipal climate policy centers children's wellbeing and safety
