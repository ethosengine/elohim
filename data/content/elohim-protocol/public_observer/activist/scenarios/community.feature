Feature: Community Organizing for Activist
  As an activist in the public_observer system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to build grassroots power and document local impacts
  So that community voices drive policy decisions

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the activist user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active

  Scenario: Activist documents neighborhood displacement patterns
    Given the activist is organizing against gentrification
    And needs evidence of displacement in specific neighborhoods
    When the Observer provides hyperlocal data
    Then the activist sees rent increase patterns by block
    And views eviction filing trends over time
    And identifies buildings with code violations
    And maps demographic changes showing displacement
    And organizes residents with documented evidence

  Scenario: Activist identifies affected community members for organizing
    Given a city policy will impact 300 residents in the neighborhood
    And the activist needs to build organized base
    When the Observer detects affected residents
    Then the activist can see community impact patterns
    And identify residents most affected by the issue
    And facilitate grassroots testimony development
    And build coalition grounded in lived experience
    And transform policy analysis into community power

  Scenario: Activist tracks local environmental justice issues
    Given pollution sources affect the activist's community
    And residents report health concerns
    When the Observer documents environmental conditions
    Then the activist sees air quality trends by neighborhood
    And maps proximity of industrial facilities to residences
    And tracks permit violations and regulatory responses
    And organizes community for accountability demands
    And environmental racism becomes documented and actionable

  Scenario: Activist coordinates neighborhood tenant association
    Given multiple tenants face similar landlord issues
    And the activist is organizing tenant power
    When the Observer facilitates secure coordination
    Then tenants can connect without landlord surveillance
    And see patterns across different units and buildings
    And coordinate collective bargaining for repairs
    And track landlord compliance with commitments
    And individual tenant struggles become collective action

  Scenario: Activist connects community issue to citywide pattern
    Given the activist is fighting playground neglect locally
    When the Observer shows citywide park maintenance data
    Then the activist sees systematic under-investment in certain neighborhoods
    And identifies which communities face similar conditions
    And connects local organizing to citywide advocacy
    And frames individual grievance as structural injustice
    And builds power through pattern recognition
