Feature: Education Policy and Professional Expertise for Teacher
  As a teacher in the public_observer system
  Operating at the educational governance layer
  I want to center professional expertise in education decisions
  So that education policy serves student learning not bureaucratic compliance

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teacher user is registered in the system
    And the educational governance context is active

  Scenario: Teacher grounds curriculum debate in professional knowledge
    Given the school board debates curriculum approaches
    And discussion is dominated by political ideology not educational evidence
    When teachers contribute professional expertise through Observer
    Then board receives aggregated teacher insights on effective curriculum
    And teachers provide research evidence on curriculum approaches
    And share classroom examples of what actually works for students
    And connect curriculum to actual student learning outcomes
    And education policy discussion becomes evidence-based and professional

  Scenario: Teacher exposes gap between policy rhetoric and classroom reality
    Given administrators promote new "personalized learning" initiative
    And claim technology will revolutionize teaching
    When teachers document actual implementation through Observer
    Then teachers show "personalized learning" means students on computers alone
    And reduced human interaction and teacher-student relationships
    And technology substitutes for reduced staffing
    And student engagement declining not improving
    And teacher evidence reveals policy rhetoric vs learning reality

  Scenario: Teacher connects resource allocation to learning outcomes
    Given district allocates resources based on administrative priorities
    And claims all schools receive equitable support
    When teachers document resource-outcome patterns through Observer
    Then teachers show schools with counselors have better student wellbeing
    And smaller class sizes correlate with better learning outcomes
    And arts programs predict higher engagement and graduation rates
    And teacher professional judgment is validated by student outcome data
    And resource allocation becomes student-centered not administratively convenient

  Scenario: Teacher advocates for evidence-based special education practices
    Given students with learning differences need specialized support
    And current special education approach is compliance-focused not learning-focused
    When teachers coordinate around special education reform through Observer
    Then teachers document what actually helps students with diverse needs
    And share successful inclusive practices across schools
    And identify barriers to effective special education (caseloads, resources, training)
    And build coalition with parents of students with disabilities
    And special education becomes about student learning not just paperwork

  Scenario: Teacher challenges standardized assessment overemphasis
    Given standardized testing dominates education policy decisions
    And teachers know tests measure narrow slice of learning
    When teachers provide professional perspective on assessment through Observer
    Then teachers show how test prep narrows curriculum and reduces rich learning
    And document student stress and declining engagement with testing
    And present comprehensive assessment approaches that inform teaching
    And build parent coalition around learning-centered not test-centered education
    And assessment policy reflects professional expertise about student learning

  Scenario: Teacher informs early literacy policy with classroom expertise
    Given state mandates specific reading instruction approach
    And approach contradicts teacher professional knowledge and research
    When teachers document reading instruction reality through Observer
    Then teachers show mandated approach doesn't work for all students
    And provide evidence on effective literacy practices for diverse learners
    And document student reading outcomes under different approaches
    And coordinate with literacy researchers and reading specialists
    And reading policy becomes informed by professional expertise not ideology

  Scenario: Teacher reveals disciplinary policy impacts on students
    Given district implements zero-tolerance discipline policy
    And claims it improves school safety and learning environment
    When teachers track disciplinary policy impacts through Observer
    Then teachers document disproportionate impact on students of color
    And show suspensions increase rather than decrease behavior issues
    And demonstrate how exclusionary discipline harms student learning
    And propose restorative practices as evidence-based alternative
    And disciplinary policy becomes educational equity issue

  Scenario: Teacher builds parent-teacher coalition for education quality
    Given parents and teachers share commitment to student learning
    But often lack coordination around education policy
    When the Observer facilitates parent-teacher alignment
    Then teachers share professional insights on education policy impacts
    And parents provide family perspective on student experiences
    And shared analysis reveals common interests (smaller classes, arts, counselors)
    And parent-teacher coalition advocates together to decision-makers
    And cross-stakeholder solidarity transforms education advocacy power
