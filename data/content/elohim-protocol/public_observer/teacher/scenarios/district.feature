Feature: District Governance and Resource Allocation for Teacher
  As a teacher in the public_observer system
  Operating at the district governance layer
  I want to inform board decisions with professional expertise
  So that district policies support effective teaching and student learning

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the teacher user is registered in the system
    And the district governance context is active

  Scenario: Teacher decodes school board agenda in morning brief
    Given tonight's board meeting will vote on "instructional efficiency optimization"
    And teachers have limited time to track board activities
    When the teacher receives Observer morning brief
    Then they learn this means increasing class sizes from 24 to 28
    And see projected impact on teaching and individual attention
    And get concrete advocacy pathway (testimony, email, coordination)
    And can coordinate response with colleagues and parents during workday
    And board jargon becomes actionable intelligence

  Scenario: Teacher provides evidence on class size policy
    Given the board is considering budget cuts increasing class sizes
    And board claims research shows class size doesn't matter
    When teachers coordinate evidence-based advocacy through Observer
    Then they present district's own data showing outcomes decline as sizes increase
    And cite research on class size effects by grade level
    And show neighboring district has lower ratios and better results
    And provide teacher professional judgment grounded in evidence
    And board decision becomes informed by multiple evidence sources

  Scenario: Teacher exposes resource distribution inequities
    Given some schools have abundant materials while others lack basics
    And district claims equitable allocation
    When teachers document resources across schools through Observer
    Then data reveals wealthy-area schools get $800/student discretionary
    And high-poverty schools get $200/student discretionary
    And teachers coordinate with parents in under-resourced schools
    And bring evidence of systematic inequity to board
    And resource distribution becomes equity accountability issue

  Scenario: Teacher coalition challenges harmful curriculum mandate
    Given district mandates scripted curriculum contradicting best practices
    And individual teacher objections are dismissed as "resistance"
    When 180 teachers coordinate through Observer platform
    Then collective professional voice becomes undeniable
    And teachers present research on curriculum approach
    And document student engagement declining since mandate
    And propose evidence-based alternative approaches
    And collective expertise creates pressure for policy reconsideration

  Scenario: Teacher tracks board member voting patterns
    Given teachers need to identify genuine board allies
    And can't easily track votes across meetings
    When the Observer tracks and analyzes board member votes
    Then teachers see which members consistently support teaching conditions
    And identify which members prioritize administrative recommendations over teacher input
    And can target advocacy to persuadable members
    And recognize true allies for coalition building
    And board accountability becomes visible and actionable

  Scenario: Teacher evaluates budget priorities with evidence
    Given the district approved $2M for new administration positions
    But rejected $800K for reducing class sizes
    When the Observer makes budget trade-offs transparent
    Then teachers see value priorities (administration vs instruction)
    And calculate that rejected proposal would fund 16 teaching positions
    And document that administrative overhead increased 40% in five years
    And organize parents and community around budget priorities
    And fiscal policy becomes professional accountability issue

  Scenario: Teacher monitors superintendent promise on evaluation reform
    Given the superintendent promised to reduce evaluation paperwork burden
    And teachers experience evaluation as compliance not professional growth
    When the Observer tracks implementation over time
    Then teachers document that paperwork actually increased
    And evaluation time went from 8 hours to 12 hours annually
    And no evidence of professional development benefit
    And bring accountability data to board on broken promise
    And administrative commitments become enforceable through transparency
