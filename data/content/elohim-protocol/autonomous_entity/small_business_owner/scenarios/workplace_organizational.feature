Feature: Democratic Transition and Knowledge Transfer for Small Business Owner
  As a small_business_owner in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the workplace_organizational governance layer
  I want to facilitate workers' transition to democratic ownership with dignity
  So that my legacy becomes community institution and workers gain autonomy

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Rosa has accepted EAE acquisition of Rosa's Auto Repair
    And the workplace_organizational governance context is active
    And Rosa has chosen the two-year transition steward role

  Scenario: Owner systematically transfers tacit business knowledge to workers
    Given Rosa has 15 years of operational expertise workers need to succeed
    And her knowledge includes supplier relationships, customer preferences, and workflow optimization
    When workplace_elohim initiates knowledge transfer protocols
    Then Rosa participates in documented teaching sessions covering key business areas
    And her expertise is captured through video demonstrations and written guides
    And workers learn bookkeeping, supplier negotiation, and customer relations
    And relationship maps show supplier and customer networks with context
    And knowledge becomes institutional memory, not dependent on Rosa's presence

  Scenario: Workers gradually assume democratic governance responsibilities
    Given Rosa previously made all strategic business decisions alone
    And workers need to develop governance capacity and confidence
    When democratic transition timeline begins
    Then early phase: Rosa proposes decisions, workers approve and learn rationale
    And middle phase: workers propose decisions, Rosa advises and supports
    And late phase: workers decide democratically, Rosa consults only when requested
    And workplace_elohim tracks governance capacity growth over transition period
    And power genuinely transfers without hierarchical recapture

  Scenario: Business operations maintain continuity during ownership transition
    Given customers depend on reliable auto repair service
    And continuity protects both community institution and workers' livelihoods
    When ownership structure transforms from individual to democratic
    Then customer relationships are systematically introduced to workers as new decision-makers
    And service quality remains consistent through documented procedures
    And supplier relationships transfer with Rosa introducing workers personally
    And equipment maintenance knowledge is shared and documented
    And no disruption occurs to daily operations or customer service

  Scenario: Former owner role evolves from command to facilitation
    Given Rosa was sole decision-maker carrying full responsibility
    And transition steward role requires fundamentally different skills
    When Rosa begins facilitating rather than commanding
    Then her proposals become suggestions workers can accept or modify
    And her expertise is valued through consultation, not authority
    And conflicts are resolved through democratic process, not owner decree
    And workers request her input because it's helpful, not because it's mandated
    And workplace_elohim ensures boundaries prevent hierarchical creep

  Scenario: Workers develop confidence in collective decision-making
    Given workers have never governed a business democratically
    And they may doubt their capability initially
    When early democratic decisions succeed
    Then workers see their collective wisdom produces good outcomes
    And small decisions (schedule adjustments, supply orders) build confidence
    And larger decisions (pricing strategy, service expansion) follow as capacity grows
    And workplace_elohim documents successful democratic decision patterns
    And worker self-governance becomes normalized, not exceptional

  Scenario: Owner processes identity shift from sole owner to transition supporter
    Given Rosa's identity was tied to business ownership for 15 years
    And letting go triggers real grief and identity crisis
    When EAE provides transition support including peer counseling
    Then Rosa accesses support groups with other converted owners
    And she processes ownership loss with validation and care
    And new identity emerges: founder who chose community over extraction
    And her purpose shifts from ownership burden to legacy stewardship
    And emotional reality is honored throughout transition

  Scenario: Business adapts to worker priorities through democratic governance
    Given Rosa's priorities as owner shaped business direction
    And workers' priorities may differ in important ways
    When workers gain governance voice during transition
    Then schedule flexibility increases based on workers' family needs
    And service offerings adapt to worker expertise and interests
    And workplace improvements workers suggested previously get implemented
    And compensation equity is addressed through democratic value distribution
    And business becomes genuinely responsive to worker flourishing, not just profit

  Scenario: Transition steward compensation reflects expertise without recreating extraction
    Given Rosa receives $55K annually for coordination and knowledge transfer
    And this must be fair without enabling exploitation
    When steward compensation is evaluated democratically
    Then workers verify Rosa's salary is justified by coordination value
    And compensation is transparent and subject to democratic approval
    And Rosa cannot use steward role to reclaim ownership control
    And after two years, role ends with clear transition to worker autonomy
    And workplace_elohim monitors to prevent steward role from becoming new hierarchy

  Scenario: Customer relationships institutionalize beyond individual owner
    Given Rosa built customer loyalty through personal trust over 15 years
    And these relationships are valuable but currently dependent on her
    When customer relationship transition process begins
    Then Rosa introduces workers to customers as new business leaders
    And customer histories are documented (with privacy protection)
    And workers learn customer preferences and build direct relationships
    And customers discover democratic ownership often deepens their loyalty
    And relationships survive and strengthen beyond Rosa's involvement

  Scenario: Supplier networks transfer to democratic worker management
    Given Rosa negotiated with parts suppliers and built distributor relationships
    And these networks are essential for business operations
    When supplier relationship transition occurs
    Then Rosa introduces workers to her supplier contacts personally
    And relationship trust transfers through Rosa's endorsement
    And workers learn negotiation strategies and supplier quality assessment
    And EAE network provides volume purchasing power Rosa never had
    And supplier relationships professionalize under democratic governance

  Scenario: Equipment and facilities knowledge prevents operational failures
    Given Rosa knows every quirk of equipment and building systems
    And this tacit knowledge prevents costly breakdowns and delays
    When facilities knowledge transfer is prioritized
    Then Rosa documents equipment maintenance schedules and troubleshooting
    And workers learn which compressor sounds indicate problems
    And building system knowledge (electrical, plumbing, HVAC) is shared
    And maintenance protocols are established preventing future failures
    And institutional knowledge replaces individual expertise

  Scenario: Owner exits gracefully with community gratitude after transition completes
    Given Rosa has completed two-year transition steward commitment
    And workers are confidently governing the business democratically
    When Rosa's transition steward role concludes
    Then workers celebrate her choice to enable democratic ownership
    And community honors her as founder who chose workers over individual wealth
    And Rosa exits with consulting income and profound sense of legacy preserved
    And business continues thriving under worker governance
    And workplace_elohim documents successful transition as model for future conversions
