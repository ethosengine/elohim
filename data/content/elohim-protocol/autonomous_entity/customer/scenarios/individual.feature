Feature: Ethical Consumption and Dignified Service for Customer
  As a customer in the autonomous_entity system
  Operating at the individual governance layer
  I want consumption aligned with values and genuine human connection
  So that I support dignity and community rather than extraction

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And Ms. Johnson is a customer at democratically-converted ChickenMax (now Maria's Kitchen)
    And the individual governance context is active
    And democratic ownership transforms customer experience

  Scenario: Customer receives genuine human connection instead of scripted service
    Given corporate service is performed emotional labor monitored by surveillance
    And Ms. Johnson wants authentic connection, not corporate performance
    When democratic ownership frees workers to provide genuine care
    Then DeShawn's smile is authentic because he's valued and treated with dignity
    And conversations are unhurried because workers aren't timed on transactions
    And workers remember Ms. Johnson's preferences through relationship, not data mining
    And service becomes mutual care: workers provide food and connection, customer provides appreciation
    And community_elohim supports relationship building without creating surveillance

  Scenario: Customer experiences transparency about where money goes
    Given corporate spending is opaque—customers don't know how their payment distributes
    And Ms. Johnson cares about supporting fair wages but had no information
    When democratic business provides complete value distribution transparency
    Then she sees exactly: 60% to worker wages and benefits, 30% to community programs, 10% to sustainability
    And workers earn $18/hour minimum vs. previous corporate $11/hour
    And her $8.99 meal supports specific visible outcomes
    And transparency enables ethical consumption through informed choice
    And community_elohim provides accessible transparency dashboard for interested customers

  Scenario: Customer learns food sourcing story connecting to agricultural labor
    Given corporate food system obscures where food comes from and who grew it
    And Ms. Johnson wants to know her food's origin but lacked information
    When democratic supply chain provides sourcing transparency
    Then she learns tomatoes come from Johnson Farm where Tom practices regenerative agriculture
    And she can visit farm during open houses if interested
    And farmworker conditions and wages are transparent
    And food becomes connected to human labor and environmental stewardship, not faceless commodity
    And community_elohim provides supply chain stories and farm connections

  Scenario: Customer notices quality improvement through worker ownership
    Given corporate model pressured quality cuts for profit maximization
    And Ms. Johnson accepted mediocre quality as inevitable for fast food
    When worker ownership aligns incentives with quality
    Then food tastes better because workers care about product they own
    And vegetables are fresh (from Johnson Farm, not corporate distributor)
    And cleanliness improves through worker pride in ownership
    And quality exceeds previous corporate standards while prices remain affordable
    And community_elohim documents quality improvements for customer awareness

  Scenario: Customer consumption aligns with values through democratic option
    Given Ms. Johnson opposed worker exploitation but lacked alternatives
    And corporate greenwashing made ethical consumption impossible to verify
    When democratic business provides transparent ethical alternative
    Then her consumption supports values: worker dignity, fair wages, environmental stewardship, community wealth
    And alignment between values and consumption reduces moral cognitive dissonance
    And she feels good about supporting democratic business, not guilty about corporate extraction
    And ethical consumption becomes real choice, not marketing manipulation
    And community_elohim helps communicate values alignment opportunities

  Scenario: Customer addresses loneliness through community connection at democratic business
    Given Ms. Johnson is recently widowed experiencing social isolation
    And corporate design optimizes transaction speed, discouraging lingering and connection
    When democratic business welcomes community connection
    Then space is comfortable for lingering and conversation
    And workers have time to talk, genuinely caring about her wellbeing
    And regular customers become acquaintances building social network
    And business serves social needs beyond food provision
    And community_elohim identifies isolated customers and facilitates community connection

  Scenario: Customer gains optional participation pathway in stakeholder processes
    Given corporate businesses treat customers as transaction data, not community members
    And Ms. Johnson wants deeper engagement but had no pathway
    When democratic governance offers optional customer stakeholder participation
    Then she's invited to stakeholder meetings providing input on community programs
    And her suggestion (senior meal program) is seriously considered and implemented
    And participation is optional—she can remain simple customer or engage more deeply
    And voice is advisory not controlling (workers maintain final decision authority)
    And community_elohim facilitates stakeholder participation while protecting worker autonomy

  Scenario: Customer benefits from community programs funded by value circulation
    Given corporate extraction left minimal resources for community benefit
    And Ms. Johnson and neighbors needed community support but lacked access
    When democratic value distribution funds community programs
    Then senior meal program provides affordable nutritious food and social connection
    And subsidized pricing (sliding scale) ensures access across income levels
    And community space is available for neighborhood organizing
    And her patronage directly supports programs benefiting her and neighbors
    And community_elohim manages community programs funded by democratic business

  Scenario: Customer experiences price reduction while worker wages increase
    Given corporate model claimed low prices required low wages
    And Ms. Johnson paid $9.99 for meal while workers earned $11/hour
    When extraction is eliminated through democratic ownership
    Then meal costs $8.99 (11% price reduction)
    And workers earn $18/hour (64% wage increase)
    And both price and wage improvements are possible by eliminating corporate extraction
    And false trade-off between customer affordability and worker dignity is exposed
    And community_elohim documents value distribution showing extraction was the real cost

  Scenario: Customer privacy is protected while patterns inform worker decisions
    Given corporate surveillance tracks customers for manipulative marketing
    And Ms. Johnson values privacy but also appreciates being known
    When democratic business respects privacy while valuing relationships
    Then workers remember her through human relationship, not algorithmic tracking
    And no customer data is sold or used for manipulation
    And aggregate patterns (many customers requesting vegan options) inform decisions without individual surveillance
    And privacy and personalization coexist through human dignity, not data extraction
    And community_elohim ensures privacy-protecting pattern recognition

  Scenario: Customer discovers consumption as political act building community wealth
    Given corporate consumption felt powerless and alienating
    And Ms. Johnson didn't think her spending mattered politically
    When democratic business makes consumption politically meaningful
    Then her modest annual spending ($900) supports worker ownership and living wages
    And money circulates in community rather than extracting to distant shareholders
    And consumption choice builds democratic economy infrastructure
    And she understands individual actions aggregate into systemic transformation
    And community_elohim helps customers see collective impact of consumption choices

  Scenario: Customer loyalty deepens through values alignment and relationship
    Given corporate loyalty was transactional (rewards programs) or habitual (convenience)
    And Ms. Johnson's loyalty to ChickenMax was weak and circumstantial
    When democratic ownership creates genuine basis for loyalty
    Then loyalty comes from values alignment (supporting worker ownership)
    And relationships with workers create emotional connection
    And community commitment makes leaving feel like betraying neighbors
    And loyalty is authentic, not manufactured through manipulation
    And community_elohim tracks loyalty through retention, not surveillance rewards programs
