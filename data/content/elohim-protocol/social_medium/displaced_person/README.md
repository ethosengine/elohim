# Displaced Person - Social Medium

## Archetype

A displaced person is someone separated from their community due to various causes including climate disasters, economic hardship, domestic violence, gentrification, or internal conflict. Unlike refugees who crossed international borders, displaced persons may be within their own country or region but have lost connection to their original community. They need to maintain relationships across distance, build new community connections, and often face economic and social vulnerability.

Key characteristics:
- Age range: All ages, from children to elders
- Separated from original community for various reasons
- May be internally displaced within same country
- Often economically vulnerable
- Need to rebuild community connections
- May be fleeing domestic violence or persecution
- Climate displacement increasingly common

## Core Needs

- **Connection Maintenance**: Keep relationships with family and community left behind
- **New Community Building**: Establish connections in new location while processing loss
- **Safety and Privacy**: Protection from those they may be fleeing (domestic violence, persecution)
- **Resource Access**: Find housing, employment, support services in new location
- **Community Memory**: Preserve connection to home community and culture

## Key Relationships

- **refugee**: Shares displacement experience, though legal status differs
- **activist**: May receive support from housing rights, climate justice, or domestic violence advocates
- **community_moderator**: Supported by moderators in both origin and destination communities
- **elder**: May be elder displaced from lifelong home, or receive elder support in new location
