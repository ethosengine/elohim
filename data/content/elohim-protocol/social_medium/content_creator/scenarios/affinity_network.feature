Feature: Value-Driven Content Creation for Affinity Networks
  As a content_creator in the social_medium system
  Operating at the affinity_network governance layer
  I want to create quality content that earns reach through genuine value
  So that I can sustainably serve communities without extraction or manipulation

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the content_creator user is registered in the system
    And the affinity_network governance context is active
    And the creator is Jordan, producing educational science content

  Scenario: Creator produces quality educational content that earns reach
    Given Jordan creates a video explaining climate feedback loops
    And the content includes verified scientific sources
    And it's accessible to general audience without oversimplification
    When Jordan contributes the content to climate education affinity network
    Then the verification agent validates the scientific claims
    And the content is offered to climate education communities
    And educators and learners can review and appreciate the content
    And genuine appreciation causes the content to spread to related networks
    And Jordan receives community support for valuable educational work
    And reach is earned through demonstrated value, not algorithms

  Scenario: Creator prevented from spreading misinformation
    Given Jordan creates content making unsupported health claims
    And the claims contradict scientific consensus
    When Jordan attempts to contribute the content
    Then the verification agent surfaces counter-evidence
    And Jordan sees the evidence gaps before distribution
    And Jordan can revise with better sources or accept limited reach
    And if posted without revision, reach is limited to personal connections
    And communities are protected from health misinformation
    And Jordan learns that evidence standards enable trust and reach

  Scenario: Creator receives sustainable support from communities
    Given Jordan has consistently produced valuable climate education content
    And multiple educational communities appreciate the work
    When these communities decide to support Jordan's work
    Then they can contribute to Jordan's sustainability directly
    And support flows from communities who receive value
    And Jordan can continue creating without platform advertising
    And no surveillance or data extraction occurs
    And sustainable creator economy emerges from mutual value

  Scenario: Creator documents elder wisdom for cultural preservation
    Given Jordan collaborates with elder traditional knowledge keepers
    When Jordan creates content documenting traditional ecological knowledge
    And the elders approve the content and its use
    Then the content is shared with appropriate cultural communities
    And attribution and respect for knowledge sources is maintained
    And younger generations learn traditional wisdom
    And the elders receive recognition and value for their knowledge
    And cultural preservation happens through respectful documentation
