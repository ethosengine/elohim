Feature: Community Storytelling and Local Documentation
  As a content_creator in the social_medium system
  Operating at the community governance layer
  I want to document and share local stories and knowledge
  So that community memory is preserved and local voices are amplified

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the content_creator user is registered in the system
    And the community governance context is active
    And the creator is Sam, documenting local community stories

  Scenario: Creator documents community history through elder interviews
    Given Sam is creating an oral history project for Riverside neighborhood
    When Sam interviews Rose about neighborhood changes over 50 years
    And creates content preserving her memories and insights
    Then the content is shared with the Riverside community
    And community members add their own memories and context
    And Rose receives recognition for her knowledge contribution
    And community history is preserved for future generations
    And the content earns reach to similar history preservation projects

  Scenario: Creator covers local civic issue with evidence-based reporting
    Given the city council is voting on a controversial development
    When Sam creates content investigating the proposal's impacts
    And includes verified facts, stakeholder interviews, and documentation
    Then the verification agent validates factual claims
    And the content reaches community members affected by the decision
    And evidence-based reporting earns trust and wider reach
    And community makes better-informed decision
    And Sam builds reputation for quality local journalism

  Scenario: Creator produces age-appropriate content for local youth
    Given Sam creates content about neighborhood nature exploration
    And the content is designed for children aged 8-12
    When Sam contributes the content to educational spaces
    Then the guardian agent verifies age-appropriateness
    And local children can access the content safely
    And parents can review and approve their children's participation
    And Sam helps children learn about their local environment
    And community benefits from quality youth programming

  Scenario: Creator collaborates with activists on community campaign
    Given Riverside is organizing for better public transportation
    When Sam creates content documenting the transit challenges
    And activists provide data and community testimonials
    Then evidence-based storytelling supports the campaign
    And content earns reach through verified community impact
    And the campaign builds support through quality documentation
    And Sam's work serves community organizing without manipulation
