Feature: Cross-Border Connection and Protection for Refugee
  As a refugee in the social_medium system
  Operating at the global governance layer
  I want to maintain connection with family and culture across borders
  So that I can preserve relationships and identity despite forced displacement

  Background:
    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational
    And the refugee user is registered in the system
    And the global governance context is active
    And the refugee is Amira, who fled Syria and now lives in Germany

  Scenario: Refugee maintains family connection across borders
    Given Amira's parents and siblings remain in Syria
    And internet access in Syria is unreliable and monitored
    When Amira communicates with her family through Elohim
    And the translation agent provides Arabic-German translation
    Then communication flows securely across borders
    And her family's privacy is protected from Syrian surveillance
    And Amira maintains vital family bonds despite separation
    And the distributed architecture bypasses censorship
    And family photos and memories are safely shared

  Scenario: Refugee protected from human trafficking scheme
    Given Amira is seeking employment in Germany
    When traffickers posing as employers try to contact her
    And they offer suspiciously lucrative jobs requiring isolation
    Then the protection agent identifies trafficking patterns
    And the fraudulent messages never reach Amira
    And she is protected without knowing she was targeted
    And legitimate employment resources continue to reach her
    And vulnerable refugees are protected from exploitation

  Scenario: Refugee connects with cultural community in diaspora
    Given Amira wants to maintain Syrian cultural connections
    When she joins the Syrian diaspora cultural community
    And the community includes refugees across multiple countries
    Then she finds others who share her language and culture
    And cultural practices, recipes, and traditions are preserved
    And she participates in Arabic language maintenance
    And her children can learn their cultural heritage
    And the community provides mutual support across diaspora

  Scenario: Refugee documents journey for family reunification
    Given Amira is working toward bringing her family to Germany
    When she documents her journey and establishes housing and employment
    And she needs to prove family relationships for legal process
    Then critical documents are cryptographically secured
    And they're backed up across sanctuary institutions
    And the documentation supports family reunification application
    And legal aid organizations can access needed evidence
    And the family reunification process is supported by secure documentation
