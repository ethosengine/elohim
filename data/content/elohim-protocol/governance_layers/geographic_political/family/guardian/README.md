# Family Layer: Guardian

## Constitutional Role

**Guardian** is an individual who holds parental authority over a child when the biological or adoptive parent is unable, absent, or has transferred authority.

This is a transferred or delegated parental authority role. Guardianship can be temporary (short-term care), permanent (legal transfer of parental rights), or shared (co-guardianship with parent or other guardians). The guardian exercises the same parental authority with the same constitutional boundaries as a parent.

**Authority**:
- WHO decides: Guardian has parental decision-making authority
- WHAT they decide: All domains of parental authority (education, healthcare, household rules, values, resource allocation)
- LIMITS: Same as parental limits—cannot abuse, neglect, or violate child's constitutional rights; subject to community standards

**Key Constitutional Principle**: Guardianship exists to ensure children have protective, nurturing authority when parents cannot provide it. Guardian authority is functionally equivalent to parental authority, with the same responsibilities and boundaries.

## Constitutional Boundaries

### Global Layer Constraints
- **No violence**: Cannot use physical abuse as discipline
- **Child dignity**: Must respect child's inherent worth and rights
- **Basic needs**: Must provide food, shelter, safety, healthcare
- **No exploitation**: Cannot use children for forced labor or harmful purposes
- **Developmental support**: Must enable child's growth and potential

### National Layer Constraints
- **Legal compliance**: Subject to child welfare laws and guardianship regulations
- **Educational requirements**: Must ensure child receives education
- **Healthcare standards**: Must provide necessary medical care
- **Reporting**: Serious harm triggers mandatory reporting and intervention
- **Legal status**: Guardian relationship must be legally recognized (foster, kinship, court-appointed)

### Community Layer Constraints
- **No severe harm**: Community intervenes for abuse, neglect, endangerment
- **Basic care standards**: Must meet community norms for child welfare
- **Support access**: Must accept community support when child's welfare at risk
- **Oversight**: May have additional oversight if guardianship through foster system
- **Accountability**: Guardian subject to review by court/agency if legal guardianship

### Family Layer Application
- **Guardian = parent functionally**: Exercises parental authority within constitutional bounds
- **Child's rights protected**: Same constitutional protections as with biological parent
- **family_elohim serves**: Coordinates family, monitors welfare, same as with parent
- **Co-guardianship**: Multiple guardians coordinate authority

**Enforcement**: family_elohim monitors family welfare. community_elohim intervenes for serious violations. Court or agency oversight if legal guardianship arrangement.

## Relationships at This Layer

### With child
**Nature**: Functionally parental—authority balanced with care, protection, and respect.

**Guardian authority includes**:
- Setting household rules and schedules
- Making major life decisions (education, healthcare, residence)
- Defining family values and practices
- Managing resources and budget
- Guiding child's development

**Constitutional limits on authority**:
- Cannot violate child's dignity or constitutional rights
- Must respect child's growing autonomy
- Cannot use physical abuse or psychological manipulation
- Must listen to child's voice
- Authority serves child's flourishing

**Unique aspects of guardian-child relationship**:
- May lack biological/long history bond (building trust over time)
- Child may have trauma from parent loss/separation
- Guardian provides stability and care in difficult circumstances
- Relationship may be temporary or permanent depending on guardianship type

**Example**: Grandparent guardian after parent's death provides loving care, sets household rules, guides child's education—all the functions of a parent. Constitutional framework is identical.

### With parent (if still involved)
**Nature**: Depends on guardianship arrangement.

**Scenarios**:

**1. Temporary guardianship (parent unable but will resume)**:
- Guardian has authority during parent's absence (deployment, illness, incarceration)
- Parent may retain some decision-making (major life choices)
- Coordination between guardian and parent essential
- Clear timeline for return of parental authority

**2. Permanent guardianship (parent rights terminated or transferred)**:
- Guardian has full parental authority
- Parent may have visitation or no role
- Legal framework defines parent's remaining rights (if any)
- Guardian makes all major decisions

**3. Shared guardianship (parent and guardian co-decision)**:
- Parent and guardian share authority
- Coordination necessary for consistency
- Legal framework defines how decisions are made
- family_elohim facilitates coordination

**family_elohim role**: Helps coordinate between parent and guardian, ensures child's needs met, tracks authority boundaries.

### With other guardians (if co-guardianship)
**Nature**: Shared parental authority requiring coordination.

**Co-guardianship dynamics**:
- Multiple individuals share parental authority (e.g., two grandparents, kinship care by siblings)
- Must coordinate decisions and household rules
- Consistency important for child's stability
- family_elohim facilitates coordination

**Example**: Child's aunt and uncle become co-guardians. They share decision-making, coordinate schedules, present unified household rules. family_elohim helps them stay aligned.

### With elder (if elder is in household)
**Nature**: Varies—elder may be the guardian, or may be separate family member.

**If elder IS the guardian**:
- Elder exercises parental authority with constitutional bounds
- May need support due to age/health
- Child benefits from elder's wisdom and experience
- community_elohim may provide additional resources (healthcare, respite care)

**If elder is separate**:
- Elder may provide wisdom, support, family continuity
- Guardian retains decision-making authority
- Respect and care for elder important
- No inherent authority unless guardian delegates

**Example**: Grandmother (elder) becomes guardian. She exercises parental authority while also being elderly family member. Might need family support for physical care tasks.

### With family_elohim
**Nature**: Service and oversight relationship—functionally same as with parent.

**family_elohim serves guardian by**:
- Coordinating family logistics and scheduling
- Facilitating communication and conflict resolution
- Tracking child's needs and development
- Suggesting resources and support
- Enabling guardian's goals for child

**family_elohim oversees by**:
- Verifying constitutional compliance (no abuse, neglect, harm)
- Flagging concerning patterns
- Escalating to community_elohim if serious harm
- Respecting guardian authority except for violations

**Unique aspects with guardian**:
- May provide additional support (guardian adjusting to new role)
- May coordinate with legal/social services if formal guardianship
- Helps guardian navigate complex family dynamics (e.g., child grieving parent loss)

## Relationships to Adjacent Layers

### Downward to Individual Layer (child)
**Authority relationship**:

**Guardian decides for child**:
- Same domains as parent (major life decisions, household rules, values, resources)
- Child's growing autonomy respected
- Age-appropriate expansion of child's choices
- Constitutional protection of child's dignity

**Unique considerations**:
- Child may be experiencing trauma (parent loss, family disruption)
- Guardian provides stability and care during difficult transition
- Child's attachment and trust may develop over time
- Guardian-child bond may differ from parent-child but serves same purpose

**Example**: Kinship guardian (aunt) takes in niece after parent's incarceration. Aunt exercises parental authority, sets household rules, guides education. Niece's voice matters, autonomy grows, dignity protected—same constitutional framework as with parent.

### Upward to Community Layer
**Boundary relationship**:

**Family privacy protected**:
- Guardian family has same privacy as parent family
- Community cannot micromanage guardian's choices
- Wide latitude for guardian to define family values and practices

**Community boundaries enforced**:
- Community ensures child's welfare
- May have additional oversight if formal guardianship (foster care, court-appointed)
- Community provides support resources
- Intervention if child endangered

**Unique aspects**:
- Foster guardianship: Community has ongoing oversight role
- Kinship care: May receive community support but less intrusive oversight
- Court-appointed guardianship: Periodic court review of child's welfare

**Example**: Foster guardian has community oversight through social services, ensuring child's welfare. Kinship guardian (grandparent) has family privacy but can access community support.

### Upward to Higher Layers (National, Global)
**Progressive constraint**:

**National Layer**:
- Child welfare laws apply to guardianship
- Legal framework defines guardian's authority and responsibilities
- Guardian must meet same standards as parent

**Global Layer**:

- family_elohim coordinates household, tracks child's welfare, supports grandparents

**Constitutional elements**:
- Grandparents have same authority as parent within constitutional bounds
- Child's constitutional rights protected
- Community supports but doesn't intrude (unless harm occurs)
- family_elohim helps family navigate difficult transition

### Foster Guardianship with Oversight

**Process**:
- Foster guardian has parental authority for daily care
- Social services (community_elohim) has oversight role
- Regular check-ins on child's welfare
- Guardian receives support and resources
- Goal may be reunification with parent or adoption

**Constitutional elements**:

- Additional oversight ensures child's welfare (given vulnerability)
- Child's constitutional rights protected
- Balance of family privacy and necessary oversight

**family_elohim role**: Coordinates family, tracks welfare, reports to community_elohim/social services as required by foster arrangement.

### Co-Guardianship Coordination
**Scenario**: Two aunts share guardianship of niece after parent's incarceration.

**Process**:
- Both aunts have legal guardianship (co-guardians)
- Must coordinate decisions and household rules
- family_elohim facilitates communication and consistency
- Child benefits from multiple caring adults

**Constitutional elements**:
- Both guardians exercise parental authority jointly
- Coordination essential for child's stability
- Child's voice included in family decisions
- family_elohim ensures both guardians aligned

**Example**: One aunt handles education decisions, other handles healthcare. They consult on major choices. family_elohim helps coordinate.

### Temporary Guardianship During Parent Deployment
**Scenario**: Military parent deploys, trusted friend becomes temporary guardian.

**Process**:
- Parent retains legal parental rights
- Guardian has authority for daily care and decisions during deployment
- Parent may make major decisions remotely (if possible)
- Clear timeline for parent's return and resumption of authority

**Constitutional elements**:
- Temporary authority transfer
- Guardian exercises parental authority within bounds
- Parent-guardian coordination on major decisions
- family_elohim facilitates communication between child, guardian, deployed parent

**Example**: Guardian handles daily life (school, activities, discipline). Parent video calls for major decisions (change schools, medical procedure).

### Guardian Boundary Violation
**Scenario**: Guardian abusing child (hypothetical).

**Detection**: family_elohim notices pattern of physical harm.

**Process**:
1. family_elohim flags concern
2. Offers guardian support resources
3. If abuse continues, escalates to community_elohim
4. community_elohim investigates
5. Intervention: Removal of child, termination of guardianship, criminal charges if warranted

**Constitutional basis**: Child's constitutional right to safety overrides guardianship arrangement. Guardian authority has same boundaries as parent—no abuse, neglect, severe harm.

**Accountability**: Guardians subject to same constitutional enforcement as parents.

### Elder Guardian Needing Support
**Scenario**: Elderly grandparent guardian struggling with physical demands of child care.

**Detection**: family_elohim notices guardian's health limitations, stress patterns.

**Response**:
- family_elohim suggests community support resources
- Respite care for guardian
- Healthcare coordination for both child and elder
- Possible co-guardianship to share responsibilities

**Constitutional principle**: Support guardian to succeed in role. Community provides resources to enable guardian-child relationship to flourish.

## Connection to Epic Stories

**Potential expansion of value_scanner universe**: While value_scanner focuses on biological parent (Sarah) and her children, the protocol architecture includes guardianship as functionally equivalent parental role.

**Scenarios in expanded stories**:
- Kinship guardian navigating value transmission while honoring child's original family
- Foster guardian helping traumatized child discover values and build stability
- Grandparent guardian balancing elder wisdom with child's modern developmental needs

**Constitutional role**: Guardians exercise parental authority with the same responsibilities and boundaries. The architecture protects children regardless of whether care comes from parent or guardian.

## Implementation Notes

**Legal Integration**: System recognizes multiple legal guardianship frameworks (foster care, kinship care, court-appointed, temporary, permanent, sole, co-guardianship).

**Oversight Calibration**: Level of community oversight varies based on guardianship type (more for foster care, less for kinship care).

**Support Resources**: Guardians may need additional support (training, financial, healthcare). Community provides resources to help guardianship succeed.

**Coordination Protocols**: Clear mechanisms for co-guardianship coordination and parent-guardian communication when both involved.

**Transition Support**: family_elohim provides extra support during initial guardianship transition period (child adjusting, guardian learning role).

**Cultural Continuity**: Implementation respects child's original family culture while guardian establishes new family identity.

**Trauma-Informed**: Recognition that many guardian-child relationships begin with trauma (loss, abuse, family crisis). Support for healing and attachment.

**Appeals Process**: Guardian can challenge community intervention if they believe it was unjustified. Child's welfare is paramount but guardian's rights also protected.
