Family Layer Multigenerational Care Coordination for Elderly\n  As an elderly person in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want to maintain my role as valued family member while receiving care\n  So that I experience reciprocal care relationships across generations\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the elderly user \"Helen\" is registered in the system\n    And Helen is part of a multigenerational family\n    And Helen's daughter Sarah provides primary family care\n    And Helen has grandchildren and great-grandchildren\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim coordinates multigenerational care economy\n\n  Scenario: Family care labor made visible to prevent invisible burden\n    Given Helen's daughter Sarah provides substantial weekly care\n    And Sarah also works and has her own children\n    When Sarah assists Helen with shopping, appointments, and household tasks\n    Then the family_elohim should make this care work visible\n    And Sarah's care labor should be recognized with care tokens\n    And the family should see Sarah's contribution quantified\n    And Sarah should not feel guilty about needing recognition\n    And Helen should understand the care Sarah provides\n    And the protocol should prevent invisible exploitation of family caregivers\n    And care work should be valued, not taken for granted\n\n  Scenario: Elderly person's continued contributions made visible to family\n    Given Helen shares family stories with great-grandchildren\n    And she provides wisdom from 82 years of experience\n    When Helen contributes to family flourishing\n    Then her contributions should be visible in care economy tracking\n    And family should see that Helen still gives, not just receives\n    And care tokens should reflect her mentoring and wisdom sharing\n    And reciprocity should be visible even when care flows are asymmetric\n    And Helen should experience herself as valued contributor, not burden\n    And younger generations should learn that elders have worth\n    And the protocol should make visible what market economics erases\n\n  Scenario: Family decision-making includes elderly voice appropriately\n    Given family decisions affect Helen's care and wellbeing\n    And Helen retains decision-making capacity\n    When family governance processes occur\n    Then Helen's voice should carry weight in family decisions\n    And she should not be decided about, but consulted\n    And the family_elohim should ensure her input is heard\n    And family should not override her preferences without consent\n    And she should experience agency within family governance\n    And the protocol should preserve her standing as family elder\n    And respect should be maintained even as care needs increase\n\n  Scenario: Family care coordination prevents caregiver burnout\n    Given Sarah provides most of Helen's family care\n    And unsustainable care burden causes burnout\n    When the family_elohim analyzes care patterns\n    Then it should identify when Sarah's burden is too heavy\n    And it should suggest care distribution across family members\n    And it should surface when professional support is needed\n    And it should intervene before crisis occurs\n    And Sarah should not have to advocate for her own limits\n    And the system should protect both Helen and Sarah\n    And sustainable multigenerational care should be built proactively\n\n  Scenario: Grandparent-grandchild relationships maintained despite limitations\n    Given Helen's mobility and cognitive limitations affect interaction\n    And grandchildren want relationship with Helen\n    When grandparent-grandchild connection is facilitated\n    Then the family_elohim should coordinate visits that don't overwhelm Helen\n    And communication should be adapted to her capabilities\n    And grandchildren should be guided on how to interact respectfully\n    And Helen's contributions to grandchildren should be recognized\n    And relationships should be preserved despite changing capabilities\n    And the protocol should support connection across limitations\n    And grandchildren should learn to value elders through maintained relationship\n\n  Scenario: Family care economy includes elderly in reciprocal network\n    Given the family participates in care token economy\n    And Helen both receives and gives care\n    When family care tokens are calculated\n    Then Helen's contributions should be valued alongside her care receipt\n    And her lifetime of family care should be visible\n    And current care she receives should be framed as reciprocity\n    And family care economy should show mutual support, not one-way dependency\n    And Helen should have standing in family based on accumulated contributions\n    And the protocol should demonstrate that care flows throughout entire lifespan\n    And family economics should value elders as continuing participants\n\n  Scenario: Adult children caring for aging parents receive support\n    Given Sarah navigates complex dynamics of caring for her mother\n    And role reversal creates emotional challenges\n    When Sarah provides care for Helen\n    Then the family_elohim should provide guidance on healthy boundaries\n    And Sarah should receive recognition for care labor\n    And emotional complexity should be acknowledged\n    And Sarah should be connected to caregiver support resources\n    And Helen's dignity should be preserved through care relationship changes\n    And the protocol should support both caregiver and care recipient\n    And family care should be sustainable and healthy for all\n\n  Scenario: Family memory preservation through elderly storytelling\n    Given Helen holds decades of family history\n    And dementia threatens loss of collective memory\n    When Helen shares family stories\n    Then the family_elohim should help capture and preserve these memories\n    And Helen's storytelling should be recognized as valuable contribution\n    And great-grandchildren should learn family history from Helen\n    And her role as family memory keeper should be honored\n    And preservation should happen while she can still share\n    And the protocol should recognize cultural value of elder wisdom\n    And family heritage should be maintained through elder participation\n\n  Scenario: Family cultural values shape elderly care approach\n    Given Helen's family has specific cultural values about elder care\n    And different cultures have different expectations\n    When family care is coordinated\n    Then the family_elohim should respect cultural context\n    And care approaches should align with family cultural values\n    And Helen should receive care consistent with her cultural expectations\n    And family obligations should be understood culturally\n    And the protocol should serve diverse family structures and values\n    And no single model of \"good elder care\" should be imposed\n    And cultural wisdom about aging should be honored\n\n  Scenario: Multigenerational household coordination when elderly live with family\n    Given some families have Helen living with adult children\n    And multigenerational households have complex dynamics\n    When household governance includes elderly family member\n    Then the family_elohim should mediate competing needs\n    And Helen's needs should be balanced with other household members\n    And her voice should be heard in household decisions\n    And privacy should be maintained for all generations\n    And care should be coordinated without overwhelming household\n    And the protocol should support healthy multigenerational living\n    And all family members' flourishing should be considered\n\n  Scenario: End-of-life planning as family governance issue\n    Given Helen is facing mortality consciously\n    And her death will affect entire family\n    When family discusses Helen's end-of-life wishes\n    Then the family_elohim should facilitate dignity-preserving conversations\n    And Helen's wishes should be documented and shared with family\n    And family should understand and commit to honoring her preferences\n    And emotional complexity should be supported\n    And Helen's voice should be authoritative about her own death\n    And family should be prepared to advocate for her wishes\n    And the protocol should support family through end-of-life planning\n\n  Scenario: Great-grandchildren learn care economy through elder relationship\n    Given Helen's great-grandchildren are young children\n    And they observe family caring for Helen\n    When great-grandchildren interact with Helen\n    Then they should learn that elders deserve care and respect\n    And they should see care flowing reciprocally across generations\n    And they should experience Helen as person, not problem\n    And they should learn that humans need more care as we age\n    And they should internalize that caregiving is valuable\n    And the protocol should teach care economy through family relationships\n    And next generation should grow up assuming care reciprocity is normal\n",
