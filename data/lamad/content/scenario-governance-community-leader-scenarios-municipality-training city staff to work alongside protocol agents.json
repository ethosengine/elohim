  "content": "Scenario: Training city staff to work alongside protocol agents\n    Given city employees need to understand protocol to do their jobs\n    And they may feel threatened by AI systems\n    When I coordinate staff training and cultural adaptation\n    Then we explain: how protocol augments not replaces their work\n    And we provide: training on working with agent information\n    And we clarify: that professional judgment remains valued\n    And we ensure: staff see agents as tools not replacements\n    And we maintain: good jobs with dignity for city workers\n    And we demonstrate: that democratic AI can strengthen not undermine labor\n    And implementation respects: people doing the work\n",
