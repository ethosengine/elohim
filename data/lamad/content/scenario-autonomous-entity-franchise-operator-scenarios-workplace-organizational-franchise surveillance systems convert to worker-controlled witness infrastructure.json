  "content": "Scenario: Franchise surveillance systems convert to worker-controlled witness infrastructure\n    Given corporate-mandated cameras monitored workers for compliance and speedup\n    And surveillance served corporate extraction, not worker protection\n    When conversion disconnects corporate surveillance feed\n    Then cameras network to local Elohim node under worker control\n    And footage protects workers from customer harassment and safety violations\n    And surveillance data cannot be used for discipline or productivity pressure\n    And workers democratically govern when and how footage is accessed\n    And workplace_elohim ensures corporate has no backdoor access to surveillance\n",
