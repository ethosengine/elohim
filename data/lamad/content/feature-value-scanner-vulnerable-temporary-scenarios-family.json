  "content": "Feature: Family Governance and Relationships During Temporary Vulnerability\n  As a person navigating complex family dynamics during crisis\n  I want tools to coordinate family relationships across multiple contexts\n  So that I can protect my children, maintain supportive connections, and navigate fraught family governance\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am managing family relationships during crisis\n    And my family structure includes my children, potentially supportive extended family, and legal interface with abuser\n    And I am using the family_elohim to coordinate complex family dynamics\n    And some family relationships are supportive while others are harmful\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating legal family governance with abusive ex-partner\n    Given I am navigating custody, protective orders, and child support with my abuser\n    And I need to minimize contact while managing legal obligations\n    When legal family governance requires communication\n    Then the family_elohim helps me manage legally-required communication only\n    And provides templates for documented, bounded interactions\n    And tracks all communications for legal purposes\n    And helps me maintain protective boundaries while meeting legal requirements\n    And alerts me to concerning patterns or escalation\n    And my personal_agent coaches me through high-stress legal interactions\n    And recognizes this boundary management as substantial emotional labor\n    And validates that minimizing contact while co-parenting is appropriate\n\n  Scenario: Protecting children's relationship with abusive parent when legally required\n    Given my children have court-ordered visitation with their abusive parent\n    And I need to support children's wellbeing within legal constraints\n    When children navigate relationship with abusive parent\n    Then the family_elohim helps me prepare children appropriately\n    And tracks children's responses to visitation\n    And helps me support children's processing of complex feelings\n    And documents concerning behaviors for legal purposes if needed\n    And connects me to resources on supporting children through this\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of safety protocols around visitation\n    And recognizes my emotional labor supporting children through this trauma\n    And validates that my protective responses are appropriate\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating support from extended family members who are helpful\n    Given some extended family members (my parents, siblings) want to help\n    And their support is genuine and appropriate\n    When I coordinate family assistance with children or resources\n    Then the family_elohim helps me organize extended family support\n    And tracks who's helping with what to distribute requests fairly\n    And maintains my authority as primary decision-maker\n    And ensures family help respects my boundaries and parenting choices\n    And facilitates communication about children's needs\n    And my personal_agent helps me ask for help when needed\n    And recognizes that coordinating family support is labor\n    And validates that accepting help is strength, not failure\n\n  Scenario: Managing boundaries with extended family members aligned with abuser\n    Given some extended family members (potentially abuser's family, some of my family) excuse or minimize abuse\n    And I need to protect myself and children from these relationships\n    When problematic family members attempt contact or involvement\n    Then the family_elohim helps me maintain firm boundaries\n    And provides language for declining contact or setting limits\n    And tracks boundary violations for safety purposes\n    And supports me in limiting children's contact when appropriate\n    And helps me navigate family pressure to reconcile or minimize abuse\n    And my personal_agent validates that protecting my household is my right\n    And recognizes boundary enforcement as essential protective labor\n    And supports me saying \"no\" to family expectations that endanger wellbeing\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating family information sharing to protect privacy and safety\n    Given different family members have different levels of trustworthiness\n    And information about my location or situation could compromise safety\n    When I decide what to share with which family members\n    Then the family_elohim helps me track what information each person has\n    And provides graduated privacy controls for different relationships\n    And alerts me if information sharing could create safety risks\n    And helps me maintain consistent boundaries about what I disclose\n    And supports me withholding information from untrustworthy family\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of safety protocols\n    And recognizes information management as constant cognitive labor\n    And validates that privacy protection is appropriate\n\n  Scenario: Managing children's relationships with extended family during crisis\n    Given my children have relationships with grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins\n    And these relationships may be supportive, complicated, or harmful\n    When I coordinate children's extended family contact\n    Then the family_elohim helps me facilitate healthy family relationships\n    And supports me in

family members judge me for leaving, for being \"difficult,\" for accessing assistance\n    And I am vulnerable to internalizing family shame and blame\n    When family members express stigmatizing

brave and appropriate\n    And recognizes resisting family judgment as emotional labor\n    And supports my right to distance from unsupportive family\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating family participation in children's lives during instability\n    Given my children's lives are disrupted by housing changes and crisis\n    And extended family wants to support children's stability\n    When I organize family involvement in children's education, activities, care\n    Then the family_elohim coordinates family practical support\n    And helps family members contribute according to their capacity\n

family participation strengthens children's support network\n\n  Scenario: Managing family expectations about my crisis recovery timeline\n    Given family members have opinions about how quickly I should \"get back on my feet\"\n    And my actual recovery is proceeding at appropriate pace for trauma\n    When family pressure conflicts with my needs\n    Then the family_elohim helps me resist

boundary-setting with family as emotional labor\n    And supports my right to recover at my own pace\n\n  Scenario: Rebuilding family identity and culture after leaving abuse\n    Given my family culture was defined by abusive dynamics\n    And I am creating new family identity with my children\n    When I establish new family values, traditions, and norms\n    Then the family_elohim helps me articulate our family values\n    And supports creation of new family traditions that reflect our healing\n    And helps children understand our family transformation\n    And tracks what family practices we want to keep vs. change\n    And validates that redefining family is important work\n    And my personal_agent helps me communicate family values consistently\n    And recognizes family culture creation as substantial care work\n    And celebrates our family becoming who we want to be\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating family decision-making about major changes\n    Given major decisions affect my children and our whole family\n    And I want children to have age-appropriate voice while I retain authority\n    When we face decisions about housing, location, schooling, or other major changes\n    Then the family_elohim facilitates age-appropriate family discussions\n    And helps children express their needs and preferences\n    And supports me in making final decisions

heard appropriately\n    And recognizes inclusive decision-making as sophisticated parenting\n    And celebrates family decisions made together\n\n  Scenario: Managing family financial governance with child support uncertainty\n    Given I am supposed to receive child support but it's unreliable\n    And family finances are therefore unpredictable\n    When I manage family financial planning with uncertain child support\n    Then the family_elohim helps me plan for multiple scenarios\n    And tracks child support payments and non-payments\n    And documents non-payment for legal enforcement if needed\n    And helps me make financial decisions despite uncertainty\n    And connects me to legal resources for child support enforcement\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to missing payments\n
