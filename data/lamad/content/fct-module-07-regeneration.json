Here are some organizations and movements that approach regenerative practices from a faith perspective, with an emphasis on inclusivity and systemic change:\n\nWild Church Network: A collective of faith communities that meet outside and focus on reconnecting people with nature, emphasizing ecological spirituality and stewardship.  \nParish Collective: Cultivates neighborhood-rooted communities that are inclusive, creative, and committed to the flourishing of their local contexts.  \nNew Monasticism: A movement that seeks to embody Christian community in intentional, inclusive ways, often in marginalized neighborhoods.  \nEco-Congregation: An ecumenical program helping churches make the link between environmental issues and Christian faith, and respond in practical action.  \nCreation Justice Ministries: Represents the creation care and environmental justice policies of major Christian denominations, focusing on systemic change.  \nThe Oikos Institute: A Christian think tank exploring regenerative economics and sustainable development from a theological perspective.  \nThe Transforming Center: Offers resources for church leaders to cultivate spiritual transformation, including practices that foster inclusive community.  \nThe Missional Wisdom Foundation: Experiments with and teaches about alternative forms of Christian community, emphasizing inclusivity and sustainability.  \nThe Catholic Climate Covenant: Addresses climate change from a faith perspective, emphasizing integral ecology and community-based solutions.  \nBartimaeus Cooperative Ministries: Integrates biblical study with ecological and economic literacy, and radical discipleship in local contexts.\n\nThese organizations tend to emphasize:\n\nWhole-community approaches rather than top-down charity models  \nIntegration of ecological concerns with social and spiritual practices  \nReimagining church structures and practices for greater inclusivity and sustainability  \nConnecting faith principles with concrete action for systemic change\n\nThey offer models of how faith communities can embody regenerative practices in inclusive ways, seeing themselves as part of the ecosystem they're trying to heal and transform, rather than as outside saviors.\n\n**Raw Markdown:** \n\n## Regeneration and Reconciliation \\- Changing the paradim of church success.\n\n###

Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors.\n\nBecause the problems we are discussing are often externalities produced by the things that we are doing more of, regenerative solutions are oftentimes found in understanding what we could do less.\n\n### Bible Reference(s)\n\n( Prophetic Imagination? )\n\nActs 2:42-47 The Fellowship of the Believers (Right-sizing) \n\n42And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 43And awed came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 44And all who believed were together and had all things in common. 45And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 46And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.\n\n“Thus says the Lord of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord.” Then the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? Now, therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways. You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes. “Thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways. Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the Lord. You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the Lord of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house. Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors.”  \nHaggai 1:2‭-‬11 ESV\n\nhttps://bible.com/bible/59/hag.1.2-11.ESV\n\n### Story \n\nMatthew 6: Giving to the Needy  \n6 “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.\n\n2 “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\n\nPrayer  \n5 “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\n\n9 “This, then, is how you should pray:\n\n“‘Our Father in heaven,  \nhallowed be your name,  \n10 your kingdom come,  \nyour will be done,  \n    on earth as it is in heaven.  \n11 Give us today our daily bread.  \n12 And forgive us our debts,  \n    as we also have forgiven our debtors.  \n13 And lead us not into temptation,\\[a\\]  \n    but deliver us from the evil one.\\[b\\]’\n\n14 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\n\nFasting  \n16 “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 17 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18 so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\n\nTreasures in Heaven  \n19 “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n\n22 “The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy,\\[c\\] your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eyes are unhealthy,\\[d\\] your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness\\!\n\n24 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\n\nDo Not Worry  \n25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life\\[e\\]?\n\n28 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\n\n### Discussion Question or Activity\n\nHow can churches embody Christ's vision of regeneration and reconciliation in their use and development of technology, while avoiding the pitfalls of extractive systems and harmful externalities?\"\n\nThis question encourages students to:\n\nReflect on Jesus' teachings about regeneration and reconciliation in light of modern technological challenges.  \nConsider how churches can model humane technology practices that align with Kingdom values.  \nCritically examine current church practices that may unintentionally contribute to extractive or harmful systems.  \nBrainstorm practical ways churches can shift towards more regenerative and reconciliatory approaches to technology use and development.  \nExplore the tension between growth/expansion and sustainability/stewardship in both technological and spiritual contexts.  \nApply concepts from the CHT course like externalities, regenerative systems, and \"binding scale to responsibility\" to a church context.  \nDiscuss how churches can be prophetic voices advocating for more humane technology in broader society.\n\nThis question invites rich discussion that bridges theological reflection, practical application, and critical analysis of current practices \\- key goals for this Christian companion course to the CHT material.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n We should be seeking faith-based models that go beyond \"serving the poor\" to truly embodying inclusive ways of being the church. Here are some organizations and movements that approach regenerative practices from a faith perspective, with an emphasis on inclusivity and systemic change:\n\nWild Church Network: A collective of faith communities that meet outside and focus on reconnecting people with nature, emphasizing ecological spirituality and stewardship.  \nParish Collective: Cultivates neighborhood-rooted communities that are inclusive, creative, and committed to the flourishing of their local contexts.  \nNew Monasticism: A movement that seeks to embody Christian community in intentional, inclusive ways, often in marginalized neighborhoods.  \nEco-Congregation: An ecumenical program helping churches make the link between environmental issues and Christian faith, and respond in practical action.  \nCreation Justice Ministries: Represents the creation care and environmental justice policies of major Christian denominations, focusing on systemic change.  \nThe Oikos Institute: A Christian think tank exploring regenerative economics and sustainable development from a theological perspective.  \nThe Transforming Center: Offers resources for church leaders to cultivate spiritual transformation, including practices that foster inclusive community.  \nThe Missional Wisdom Foundation: Experiments with and teaches about alternative forms of Christian community, emphasizing inclusivity and sustainability.  \nThe Catholic Climate Covenant: Addresses climate change from a faith perspective, emphasizing integral ecology and community-based solutions.  \nBartimaeus Cooperative Ministries: Integrates biblical study with ecological and economic literacy, and radical discipleship in local contexts.\n\nThese organizations tend to emphasize:\n\nWhole-community approaches rather than top-down charity models  \nIntegration of ecological concerns with social and spiritual practices  \nReimagining church structures and practices for greater inclusivity and sustainability  \nConnecting faith principles with concrete action for systemic change\n\nThey offer models of how faith communities can embody regenerative practices in inclusive ways, seeing themselves as part of the ecosystem they're trying to heal and transform, rather than as outside saviors.\n\n### Application \n\n(This section should have One-To-One applications with Minimizing Harmful Consequences)   \n\\* We must see ourselves as Christans in a universal sense, if we are growing because other smaller congregations aren't as resourced are as capable as we are, or poaching from other christian communities, does not count toward growth as a body.   \n\\-- As such, we should develop some ministry which seeks the development and success of other communities of christians, what we do well MUST be shared with the body, the full body of Christ.  \n\\-- Church planting, building campaigns, or relocating should regenrate places that we previously have been. (San Pedro \\-\\> Thousand Oaks)\n\n\\* We need to maximize the sustainability of our operations where we can, large buildings, debt-servicing (but provides loans and grants), huge energy bills (operate with renewable energy), transportation (make everywhere we for people first (walk, bike, tansit), deliver health-care, social services , risk-transfer (stabilize incomes).\n\n\\* We need a positive model for political discernment of the body which is judged by real measurable outcomes not lipservice to stated goals, we cannot be a community which serves the poor, prisoners, immigrants, orphans, and widows, while voting for a political representatives who impoverish, imprison, criminalize, orphan, and widow.  ( We cannot continue sinning, \\[or advocate for consequences\\], so that grace may abound )\n\n\\* Our lives must reflect our identity as christians,   \n\\--if we-members are working in industry that is generating externalities, we could dedicate capacity to helping people re-align their vocation with those values, without penalty or disruption.   \n\\--if we-members are living in such a way that is generating externalities (Parable of the Polygons), we should encourage people to make active choices and not rely on passive hope that someone will happen upon what a life well lived looks like. \n\n### Class Homework\n\nCHT Module 4: Centering Values  \nGyfted \\- Values Survey\n\n### Other Media / Go Deeper / Class Maps\n\nRegeneration through the lens of Public Infrastructure (Commons):   \nNew\\_ Public: A non-profit initiative focused on building better digital public spaces that foster community and democracy.  \nCenter for Humane Technology: Works to realign technology with humanity's best interests, addressing the harms of current tech and promoting more ethical alternatives.  \nStrong Towns:   \nDoughnut Economics Action Lab (DEAL): Promotes Kate Raworth's economic model that balances essential human needs with planetary boundaries.  \nZebra's Unite Coop:   \nTransition Network: Supports community-led responses to climate change and shrinking supplies of cheap energy, building resilience and happiness.  \n \\- Learning form Living Systems (nature- inspired Systems Practices)  \n  \\-- Permaculture  \n  \\-- Regenerative agriculture  \n  \\-- Biomimicry  \n  \\-- Systems-thinking (ecosystems)   \n  \\-- Rewilding  \n  \\-- Biophilic design  \n  \\-- Regenerative leadership/business  \n  \\-- Regenerative Economics  \n  \\-- Nature-inspired wellbeing/citizenship  \nShareable: A nonprofit media outlet and action network promoting sharing-based solutions for a more resilient and equitable world.  \nP2P Foundation: Researches, documents, and promotes peer-to-peer practices in a variety of fields.  \nCommons Network: Think tank promoting access to knowledge and other social and ecological causes from a commons perspective.  \nRegeneration International: Promotes food, farming and land use systems that regenerate and stabilize climate systems, the health of the planet and people.  \nThe Biomimicry Institute: Empowers people to create nature-inspired solutions for a healthy planet.  \nEllen MacArthur Foundation: Promotes the transition to a circular economy, where waste and pollution are designed out.  \nPost-Growth Institute: An international group exploring and inspiring paths to global prosperity that don't rely on economic growth.  \nThe Natural Step: Helps organizations and individuals understand and move towards sustainability.  \nPresencing Institute: Develops awareness-based methodologies for leadership and change.  \nRegenesis Group: Provides regenerative development services to create vitality in human and natural systems.  \nCapital Institute: Explores and promotes economic transition strategies aligned with living systems principles.  \nCommonspoly: A board game teaching principles of commoning and cooperation, in contrast to monopolistic practices.  \nDark Matter Labs: Designs institutional infrastructure for a distributed, democratic and sustainable next economy.  \nThe Next System Project: Promotes visions, models and pathways that point to a \"next system\" radically different from today's failed systems.  \nPlatform Cooperativism Consortium: Supports the development of a more democratic digital economy.  \nParticipatory City Foundation: Works on large-scale practical participatory ecosystem approaches to city transformation.\n\n",
