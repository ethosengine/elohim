  "content": "**Instructions:** For Individual Christians:\n\nPersonal Lifestyle Audit: Develop a tool for individuals to assess how their daily choices (consumption, housing, transportation, etc.) impact justice in their communities.  \n\"Justice in Practice\" Challenge: Create a 30-day program that guides individuals to make incremental changes in their lifestyle to promote justice (e.g., ethical consumption, community engagement).  \nDigital Footprint Evaluation: Provide a framework for Christians to critically evaluate their online behavior and digital consumption habits in light of justice principles.  \nEthical Stewardship Course: Develop a course on managing personal finances and resources in ways that promote justice and support marginalized communities.  \nCommunity Impact Assessment: Guide individuals in mapping their sphere of influence and identifying opportunities to advocate for justice in their workplaces, neighborhoods, and social circles.\n\nFor Church Leaders and Developers:\n\nHolistic Church Audit: Expand the \"Digital Justice Audit\" to include all aspects of church operations, including budgeting, community engagement, and physical resources.  \nJustice-Centered Discipleship Program: Develop a comprehensive discipleship curriculum that integrates justice principles into all aspects of Christian living and church participation.  \nEthical Tech Development Framework: Create guidelines for Christian tech professionals to ensure their work promotes justice and human dignity.  \n\"Kingdom Economics\" Workshop: Design a workshop that challenges church financial practices and explores alternative economic models aligned with biblical justice.  \nCommunity Needs Assessment Tool: Develop a systematic approach for churches to identify and address justice issues in their local communities.  \nInclusive Worship Design: Create resources for designing worship experiences that are accessible and meaningful across socioeconomic backgrounds.  \n\"Digital Jubilee\" Initiative: Develop a program for churches to address digital inequality in their communities through skills training, equipment provision, and advocacy.  \nJustice-Oriented Missions Strategy: Rethink short-term missions and charitable giving to prioritize long-term community development and systemic change.\n\nPriorities for Implementation:\n\nEducation and Awareness: Prioritize helping individuals and churches understand the connection between personal choices, church practices, and systemic injustice.  \nPractical Application: Focus on actionable steps that individuals and churches can take immediately to promote justice.  \nSystemic Thinking: Encourage a shift from charitable giving to addressing root causes of injustice.  \nCommunity Engagement: Prioritize building relationships and partnerships with marginalized communities to inform justice efforts.  \nTechnology as a Tool: View technology not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote justice and human flourishing.  \nContinuous Reflection: Implement regular assessment and reflection practices to ensure ongoing alignment with justice principles.  \nProphetic Witness: Empower churches and individuals to advocate for just policies and practices in their broader communities and political spheres.\n\nThese applications and priorities aim to move beyond surface-level changes to foster a deep, lived commitment to justice that permeates all aspects of Christian life and church practice. They challenge both individuals and churches to critically examine their roles in perpetuating or dismantling unjust systems and to take concrete steps towards embodying God's justice in the world.\n**PracticeType:** application",
