  "content": "Feature: Educational Coordination and Advocacy During Temporary Vulnerability\n  As a parent navigating crisis while coordinating children's education\n  I want tools to maintain educational continuity and access support services\n  So that my children's education doesn't suffer due to our temporary circumstances\n\n  Background:\n    Given I am parenting children during crisis or housing instability\n    And my children's education is being disrupted by our circumstances\n    And I am using the Value Scanner to coordinate educational needs\n    And schools and educational institutions are part of our navigation\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining children's educational continuity during housing transitions\n    Given I am moving between temporary housing or shelters\n    And my children need stable educational engagement despite housing instability\n    When we experience housing transitions\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me understand children's educational rights (McKinney-Vento)\n    And coordinates school enrollment, transfers, and records\n    And ensures children can continue at current school if educationally beneficial\n    And arranges transportation if needed for school continuity\n    And tracks educational transitions and helps minimize disruption\n    And my personal_agent manages school documentation and deadlines\n    And recognizes educational coordination as substantial parenting labor\n    And validates that maintaining school stability protects children\n\n  Scenario: Accessing educational support services for children experiencing trauma\n    Given my children are exhibiting trauma responses affecting learning\n    And schools have support services (counseling, IEPs, 504 plans, trauma-informed support)\n    When I advocate for educational support for my children\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me identify appropriate educational interventions\n    And provides information about my children's rights to services\n    And helps me navigate IEP or 504 plan processes\n    And coordinates with school counselors and support staff\n    And tracks children's educational support needs and services received\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of educational meetings and deadlines\n    And recognizes educational advocacy as sophisticated parenting work\n    And validates that trauma affects learning and requires support\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating with teachers about children's circumstances\n    Given teachers need some information to support my children appropriately\n    And I need to protect privacy while ensuring teachers understand context\n    When I communicate with children's teachers\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me determine what to disclose\n    And provides language for explaining relevant context without oversharing\n    And helps me advocate for appropriate accommodations\n    And tracks teacher communications and commitments\n    And validates that teachers should know enough to support children\n    And my personal_agent drafts communications that balance privacy and advocacy\n    And recognizes school communication as ongoing parenting labor\n    And supports appropriate teacher partnership in children's support\n\n  Scenario: Managing children's school participation despite resource constraints\n    Given school requires fees, supplies, or resources I cannot afford\n    And children need to participate fully in educational activities\n    When resource constraints threaten children's school participation\n    Then the Value Scanner identifies school assistance programs and resources\n    And helps me access fee waivers, supply assistance, scholarship programs\n    And connects me to community resources for school needs\n    And validates that lack of resources shouldn't exclude children\n    And my personal_agent tracks school financial requirements and deadlines\n    And recognizes resource navigation as substantial invisible labor\n    And ensures children's educational participation despite poverty\n\n  Scenario: Supporting children's learning at home amid crisis and instability\n    Given children need home learning support and homework help\n    And I am traumatized, stressed, and have limited time and energy\n    When I try to support children's learning despite constraints\n    Then the Value Scanner provides appropriate learning support strategies\n    And helps me access homework help resources (libraries, tutoring, online support)\n    And suggests realistic expectations for home learning support given my capacity\n    And validates that my limited bandwidth is reasonable given circumstances\n    And tracks children's learning progress and needs\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of important school deadlines and events\n    And recognizes home learning support as valuable educational labor\n    And celebrates my children's learning engagement despite crisis\n\n  Scenario: Navigating school bureaucracy and institutional requirements\n    Given schools require forms, meetings, documentation, and coordination\n    And school bureaucracy can be overwhelming during crisis\n    When I manage school institutional requirements\n    Then the Value Scanner tracks all school deadlines and requirements\n    And helps me gather necessary documentation efficiently\n    And prepares me for required school meetings (IEP, parent-teacher conferences)\n    And ensures nothing falls through cracks despite my overwhelm\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of upcoming school obligations\n    And recognizes school bureaucracy navigation as cognitive labor\n    And validates that school demands are significant amid crisis\n    And prevents school requirements from overwhelming me\n\n  Scenario: Advocating for children's educational needs when institutional responses are inadequate\n    Given school is not providing appropriate support for my children\n    And I need to advocate more forcefully for services\n    When school fails to meet children's educational needs\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me understand escalation options\n    And provides resources on children's educational rights\n    And connects me to educational advocacy organizations\n    And helps me document inadequate services for advocacy purposes\n    And my personal_agent drafts advocacy communications\n    And recognizes forceful advocacy as necessary parenting work\n    And validates that schools should serve all children appropriately\n    And supports me in demanding what my children deserve\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating educational services across multiple children with different needs\n    Given I have multiple children (ages 4 and 7) with different educational contexts\n    And each child has unique needs, schools, and support requirements\n    When I manage educational coordination for multiple children\n    Then the Value Scanner tracks each child's educational needs separately\n    And coordinates across different schools, teachers, and support services\n    And helps me prioritize when children's needs conflict\n    And ensures neither child's education suffers due to complexity\n    And my personal_agent manages multiple educational calendars and requirements\n    And recognizes multi-child educational coordination as substantial labor\n    And validates that managing multiple children's education is complex\n    And prevents educational tasks from overwhelming me\n\n  Scenario: Accessing early childhood education and care for younger children\n    Given my younger child (age 4) needs early childhood education\n    And quality early childhood programs have long waitlists and costs\n    When I seek early childhood education for my young child\n    Then the Value Scanner identifies early childhood programs accepting subsidies\n    And helps me access Head Start, pre-K, or subsidized childcare\n    And navigates enrollment processes and waitlists\n    And ensures young child has educational engagement despite constraints\n    And tracks early childhood education options and applications\n    And my personal_agent manages early childhood enrollment deadlines\n    And recognizes early childhood education coordination as parenting work\n    And validates that young children deserve educational opportunities\n\n  Scenario: Supporting children's social and emotional development through school connections\n    Given children need peer relationships and social development\n    And school provides important social context during crisis\n    When I support children's social development through education\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me facilitate children's school friendships\n    And coordinates children's participation in social activities (clubs, sports, events)\n    And accesses resources for children's social activities despite cost barriers\n    And tracks children's social development and peer relationships\n    And validates that social development is as important as academics\n    And my personal_agent reminds me of school social events children care about\n    And recognizes social development facilitation as care work\n    And celebrates children's friendships and belonging\n\n  Scenario: Managing educational implications of children's trauma behaviors\n    Given my children's trauma manifests in school behaviors (acting out, withdrawal, academic struggles)\n    And school may not understand trauma-informed responses\n    When children's trauma affects their school experience\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me advocate for trauma-informed school responses\n    And provides information on trauma's educational impacts\n    And helps schools understand children's behaviors as trauma responses, not \"bad\" behavior\n    And coordinates with school mental health support\n    And tracks children's behavioral patterns and triggers\n    And my personal_agent alerts me to concerning school incidents\n    And recognizes trauma advocacy as sophisticated parenting labor\n    And validates that trauma-informed education protects children\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating educational planning for children's long-term development\n    Given crisis is temporary but children's educational trajectory is long-term\n    And current educational decisions affect future opportunities\n    When I make educational choices considering children's futures\n    Then the Value Scanner helps me consider long-term educational implications\n    And balances immediate stability needs with future development\n    And tracks children's educational progress and trajectory\n    And ensures crisis doesn't permanently derail educational opportunities\n    And validates that my
