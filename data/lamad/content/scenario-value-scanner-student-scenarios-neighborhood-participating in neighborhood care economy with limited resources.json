  "content": "Scenario: Participating in neighborhood care economy with limited resources\n    Given Kenji has severe resource constraints\n    And he cannot contribute financially to neighborhood projects\n    When the neighborhood_elohim tracks care contributions\n    Then it should recognize non-financial contributions Kenji can make\n    And it should value his labor, time, and presence\n    And it should show \"Kenji helped neighbor carry groceries: 2 care tokens\"\n    And participation should not require money\n    And the system should enable care economy participation at all resource levels\n    And students should contribute to neighborhood based on capacity\n",
