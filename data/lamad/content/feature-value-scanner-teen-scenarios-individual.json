Individual Layer Value Recognition for Teen\n  As a teen (ages 14-17) in the value scanner system\n  Operating at the individual governance layer\n  I want adult-level economic autonomy with appropriate scaffolding\n  So that I build real capability for financial independence and self-governance\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the teen user \"Jasmine\" is registered in the system\n    And Jasmine is 16 years old\n    And the individual governance context is active\n    And Jasmine's personal_agent is configured for adult-level autonomy\n    And Jasmine has part-time employment at a local retail store\n\n  Scenario: Adult-capable interface for sophisticated decision-making\n    Given Jasmine is using the Value Scanner independently\n    And she has complex financial goals and multiple contexts to manage\n    When Jasmine opens the scanner application\n    Then the interface should provide comprehensive budgeting tools\n    And the personal_agent should offer professional-grade financial analysis\n    And multi-context care tracking should be available (school, work, family, community)\n    And sophisticated planning and analysis features should be accessible\n    And privacy controls should be granular and user-controlled\n    And the interface should treat Jasmine as the competent person she is\n\n  Scenario: Teen makes independent financial decisions with real consequences\n    Given Jasmine is shopping with money from her part-time job\n    And she is saving for college expenses\n    And she has set a monthly budget of $150 for discretionary spending\n    When Jasmine considers purchasing a $60 jacket\n    Then her personal_agent should provide decision support without controlling her choice\n    And the agent should surface relevant information: \"This is 40% of your monthly discretionary budget\"\n    And the agent should connect to her goals: \"You're saving $200/month for college\"\n    And Jasmine should retain full authority to make the decision\n    And the choice should have real economic consequences\n    And the system should support learning from mistakes without catastrophic outcomes\n\n  Scenario: Building adult financial capability through practice\n    Given Jasmine manages portions of her household budget\n    And she has responsibility for weekly grocery shopping\n    And her family has allocated $100/week for her to manage\n    When Jasmine makes purchasing decisions\n    Then her personal_agent should track spending against budget\n    And provide analysis of value optimization\n    And highlight patterns: \"You've stayed within budget 7 of 8 weeks\"\n    And surface learning opportunities: \"Buying bulk rice saved $12 this month\"\n    And build sophisticated financial literacy through real practice\n    And scaffold her capability without removing decision-making authority\n\n  Scenario: Privacy controls honor teen's developing autonomy\n    Given Jasmine's care contributions are tracked across multiple contexts\n    And she has legitimate need for privacy from parents\n    When Jasmine configures her privacy settings\n    Then she should have granular control over what data is shared with whom\n    And parents should have access to family-relevant information only\n    And her personal data (friendships, personal purchases, private reflections) should be protected\n    And community resource coordinators should see care contributions but not private details\n    And employers should not access her family or school data\n    And Jasmine should actively learn to manage privacy boundaries\n\n  Scenario: Recognition of care contributions across multiple life contexts\n    Given Jasmine contributes care work in multiple domains\n    And she works 15 hours/week at her part-time job\n    And she does substantial household labor\n    And she volunteers 4 hours/week at community center\n    When her personal_agent aggregates her care contributions\n    Then all contexts should be recognized: household, paid work, volunteering, civic engagement\n    And care tokens should reflect her substantial contributions\n    And her work should be made visible as genuine economic participation\n    And she should see herself as a productive member of society\n    And her care contributions should give her standing in care economy discussions\n\n  Scenario: Personal agent serves as sophisticated decision support system\n    Given Jasmine has complex scheduling and coordination needs\n    And she balances school, work, family responsibilities, and social life\n    When Jasmine uses her personal_agent for planning\n    Then the agent should function as financial advisor, schedule coordinator, and career counselor\n    And provide information, analysis, and memory support\n    And help her see connections: \"Your work schedule affects family dinner planning\"\n    And surface opportunities: \"Your community volunteering builds skills for your intended career\"\n    And never make decisions for her\n    And model healthy AI-human partnership where AI amplifies human capability\n\n  Scenario: Value formation through autonomous exploration\n    Given Jasmine is consciously forming her personal values\n    And she tests values through real economic decisions\n    When Jasmine makes purchasing choices reflecting her values\n    Then her personal_agent should help her track alignment between values and actions\n    And surface patterns: \"You've prioritized local/sustainable products 12 of 15 purchases\"\n    And support her value exploration without imposing external values\n    And recognize that she's developing adult value framework\n    And protect her space for individual identity development\n    And acknowledge her increasing moral sophistication\n\n  Scenario: Savings and investment education through real practice\n    Given Jasmine is saving for college and future goals\n    And she has accumulated $2,400 in savings from work\n    When she explores investment options through her personal_agent\n    Then the agent should provide age-appropriate investment education\n    And explain concepts like compound interest, risk, diversification\n    And connect to her specific goals and timeline\n    And help her understand long-term financial planning\n    And provide resources for learning about different investment vehicles\n    And support her building adult financial capability\n    And never pressure her toward specific investment products\n\n  Scenario: Right to disconnect maintained for teen autonomy\n    Given Jasmine has been using the Value Scanner extensively\n    And constitutional constraints protect her agency\n    When Jasmine chooses to disconnect from the system\n    Then the disconnection must be honored immediately\n    And no data retention beyond legal requirements should occur\n    And no manipulative patterns to retain usage should be employed\n    And her right to not participate must be respected\n    And her care contributions should be exportable in standard format\n    And she should maintain full control over her participation\n\n  Scenario: Learning from financial mistakes with safety nets\n    Given Jasmine overspent her monthly budget by $40\n    And she used her college savings to cover the shortfall\n    When her personal_agent analyzes the situation\n    Then it should provide non-judgmental feedback about the pattern\n    And help her understand the long-term impact on her college savings goal\n    And support her learning from the mistake\n    And suggest strategies for getting back on track\n    And not shame or guilt her about the decision\n    And recognize that learning requires room for mistakes\n    And ensure the mistake isn't catastrophic to her future\n\n  Scenario: Building identity around care contribution and capability\n    Given Jasmine has made substantial care contributions over months\n    And she balances multiple demanding contexts successfully\n    When she reflects on her Value Scanner usage and care economy participation\n    Then she should experience herself as a capable, contributing adult\n    And her identity should be forming around care for others and community\n    And she should understand that her work has genuine economic value\n    And she should expect to be taken seriously in economic conversations\n    And she should internalize that care economy principles are normal\n    And her self-concept should reflect her actual capability and contribution\n",
