Regional Pattern Journalism for Journalist\n  As a journalist in the public_observer system\n  Operating at the county/regional governance layer\n  I want pattern detection across jurisdictional boundaries\n  So that regional investigations expose systemic issues\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the journalist user is registered in the system\n    And the county_regional governance context is active\n\n  Scenario: Journalist coordinates regional investigation across 15 municipalities\n    Given affordable housing crisis affects entire metropolitan region\n    And the journalist collaborates with reporters in neighboring coverage areas\n    When the Observer provides civic surveillance across all municipalities\n    Then journalists access comprehensive data from all 15 cities\n    And identify common patterns in zoning and development approval\n    And compare policy approaches and housing production outcomes\n    And publish coordinated regional investigation\n    And local stories reveal regional systemic failure\n\n  Scenario: Journalist exposes developer's regional exploitation pattern\n    Given a development firm proposes controversial project locally\n    And uses familiar tactics the journalist suspects are standardized\n    When the Observer tracks developer across regional jurisdictions\n    Then the journalist sees same firm operating in 8 municipalities\n    And documents pattern of community promises never fulfilled\n    And identifies political contributions across region\n    And finds environmental violations in 3 other states\n    And publishes investigation warning other communities\n    And regional surveillance exposes systematic bad actor\n\n  Scenario: Journalist detects environmental racism at regional scale\n    Given pollution facilities cluster in certain neighborhoods\n    And the journalist investigates environmental justice\n    When the Observer analyzes regional environmental patterns\n    Then the journalist sees industrial permits concentrate in communities of color\n    And maps proximity of pollution sources to schools and residences\n    And documents health outcome disparities by neighborhood and race\n    And shows pattern across county regardless of municipal boundaries\n    And publishes investigation exposing regional environmental racism\n\n  Scenario: Journalist investigates regional transit inequity\n    Given transit access varies dramatically across metropolitan area\n    And the journalist covers regional transit authority\n    When the Observer analyzes transit service distribution\n    Then the journalist sees frequent service to employment centers from white suburbs\n    And finds infrequent service in communities of color despite higher ridership\n    And documents decades of investment decisions favoring certain areas\n    And compares stated equity goals to actual funding allocation\n    And publishes accountability story on transit racism\n\n  Scenario: Journalist tracks regional displacement and gentrification\n    Given housing costs rise across metropolitan region\n    And the journalist investigates who benefits and who is harmed\n    When the Observer tracks displacement patterns regionally\n    Then the journalist sees working-class communities of color losing residents\n    And maps evictions, rent increases, and demographic changes\n    And identifies corporate landlords buying properties across region\n    And documents regional coordination of displacement\n    And publishes investigation connecting local experiences to regional pattern\n\n  Scenario: Journalist fact-checks regional economic development claims\n    Given county officials tout major economic development success\n    And claim massive job creation and tax revenue\n    When the Observer analyzes economic development outcomes\n    Then the journalist verifies jobs created are lower-wage than promised\n    And finds tax incentives cost more than revenue generated\n    And sees environmental violations and labor law violations\n    And tracks development firm's record in other regions\n    And publishes accountability story on corporate welfare\n    And instant research exposes exaggerated claims\n\n  Scenario: Journalist compares county policies to state and national patterns\n    Given county debates approach to criminal justice reform\n    And the journalist provides context on policy options\n    When the Observer enables comparative policy research\n    Then the journalist reviews outcomes from counties with reform policies\n    And analyzes data on recidivism, cost, and community safety\n    And interviews officials and residents in comparison jurisdictions\n    And provides evidence-based policy journalism\n    And regional coverage connects to national criminal justice debate\n",
