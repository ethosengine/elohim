  "content": "Scenario: Conducting ethnographic research in Riverside community\n    Given I have selected Riverside (population 45,000) for intensive case study\n    And I have secured ethical approval and community consent\n    When I begin multi-month observation of protocol implementation\n    Then I can attend Constitutional Council meetings as observer\n    And I can interview appellants like Marcus about their appeal experience\n    And I can participate in community deliberations about protocol\n    And I can track resource flows and wellbeing indicators\n    And I can document challenges and successes as they emerge\n    And The community retains ownership of data about themselves\n    And My research serves community improvement not just academic publication\n",
