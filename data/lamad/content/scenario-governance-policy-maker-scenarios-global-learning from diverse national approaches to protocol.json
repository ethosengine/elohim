  "content": "Scenario: Learning from diverse national approaches to protocol\n    Given different nations implemented protocol differently\n    And cultural context shapes governance outcomes\n    When I study international variations in implementation\n    Then I learn: from collectivist societies' community emphasis\n    And I examine: how different political systems integrate protocol\n    And I identify: universal patterns vs context-specific adaptations\n    And I share: lessons with other policy makers\n    And I adapt: my legislation based on international evidence\n    And I contribute: to global learning community\n    And I practice: epistemic humility about cultural diversity\n",
