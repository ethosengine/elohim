Family Layer Value Recognition for Student\n  As a student maintaining family connection while establishing independence\n  Operating at the family governance layer\n  I want to participate in family care economy despite geographic distance\n  So that family relationships continue while I develop adult autonomy\n\n  Background:\n    Given the Elohim Protocol is operational\n    And the student user \"Kenji\" is registered in the system\n    And Kenji is 20 years old living away from family at college\n    And Kenji's family is 300 miles away\n    And Kenji receives some financial support from family\n    And Kenji maintains regular contact with parents and siblings\n    And the family governance context is active\n    And the family_elohim could coordinate family care across distance\n\n  Scenario: Maintaining family care relationships despite geographic distance\n    Given Kenji lives 300 miles from family\n    And he cannot provide daily in-person care or support\n    When the family_elohim tracks Kenji's family contributions\n    Then it should recognize remote emotional support as care work\n    And it should value video calls with parents as connection labor\n    And it should track time spent supporting younger siblings remotely\n    And geographic distance should not make contributions invisible\n    And the system should recognize digital care as real care\n    And family connection across distance should be valued\n\n  Scenario: Receiving family financial support with dignity\n    Given Kenji receives some financial support from family\n    And traditional economics treats this as dependency or charity\n    When the family_elohim tracks family resource flows\n    Then it should frame financial support as family care investment\n    And it should recognize that families invest in young members' development\n    And it should help Kenji receive support without shame\n    And it should track this as reciprocal care economy, not dependency\n    And the system should value family investment in student development\n    And receiving family support should be dignified participation in family economy\n\n  Scenario: Contributing care work to family despite being student\n    Given Kenji provides emotional support to stressed parents\n    And he helps younger siblings with homework and advice remotely\n    When the family_elohim tracks Kenji's care contributions to family\n    Then it should recognize emotional labor supporting family members\n    And it should value advice and mentorship provided to siblings\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for family support work\n    And students should be recognized as care contributors, not just recipients\n    And the system should make Kenji's family contributions visible\n    And reciprocal care should be recognized even when receiving financial support\n\n  Scenario: Navigating independence while maintaining family belonging\n    Given Kenji is establishing adult independence\n    And he also wants to remain part of family unit\n    When the family_elohim supports this transition\n    Then it should help family recognize Kenji's emerging adult status\n    And it should maintain his belonging while respecting his autonomy\n    And it should facilitate his transition from dependent child to adult family member\n    And family relationships should evolve without breaking\n    And the system should support healthy independence development\n    And Kenji should participate in family as autonomous adult\n\n  Scenario: Family decision-making includes student voice\n    Given Kenji is becoming adult family member\n    And family makes decisions that affect him\n    When family discusses major decisions (moving, finances, elder care)\n    Then the family_elohim should ensure Kenji's voice is included\n    And it should recognize his emerging adult perspective as valuable\n    And it should facilitate his participation despite distance\n    And family governance should include student members as participants\n    And the system should support transition from child to adult family voice\n    And Kenji should participate in family decisions appropriately\n\n  Scenario: Family emergency response across distance\n    Given family emergencies can occur while Kenji is at school\n    And he may need to return home or provide remote support\n    When family crisis occurs (illness, accident, death)\n    Then the family_elohim should coordinate crisis response\n    And it should help Kenji balance academic obligations with family needs\n    And it should facilitate his care contributions from distance if he can't travel\n    And it should connect him to campus support if family crisis affects his functioning\n    And the system should recognize family crisis impact on student\n    And emergency coordination should include geographically distant students\n\n  Scenario: Sharing life learning with family\n    Given Kenji is developing new knowledge and capabilities\n    And his learning could benefit family members\n    When Kenji shares environmental science knowledge with family\n    Then the family_elohim should recognize teaching family as care contribution\n    And it should value knowledge transfer from student to parents\n    And it should recognize reverse mentoring (young teaching old) as valid\n    And Kenji's education should benefit whole family, not just himself\n    And the system should value educational contributions to family\n    And students should be recognized as bringing new knowledge to family\n\n  Scenario: Coordinating family visits and holiday logistics\n    Given Kenji returns home for holidays and breaks\n    And visit logistics require coordination and resources\n    When the family_elohim manages visit planning\n    Then it should coordinate schedules across family members\n    And it should help plan transportation, meals, and household logistics\n    And it should recognize labor involved in maintaining connection across distance\n    And it should value family members' work hosting and traveling\n    And the system should reduce friction in cross-distance family coordination\n    And maintaining family connection should be recognized as work\n\n  Scenario: Family understanding of student financial constraints\n    Given Kenji lives on $180/week total budget\n    And family might not understand severity of his constraints\n    When the family_elohim shares appropriate financial context\n    Then it should help family understand Kenji's resource limitations\n    And it should facilitate realistic expectations for gift-giving, travel, expenses\n    And it should reduce shame around financial scarcity\n    And family should understand student economic reality\n    And the system should bridge understanding gap about student poverty\n    And realistic financial communication should strengthen family relationships\n\n  Scenario: Siblings learning from student care economy practices\n    Given Kenji has younger siblings who will become students\n    And he's learning valuable care economy skills\n    When the family_elohim tracks knowledge transfer\n    Then it should recognize Kenji mentoring siblings in life skills\n    And it should value his teaching them budgeting, cooking, household management\n    And it should accumulate care tokens for mentorship work\n    And older siblings should be recognized as teachers for younger ones\n    And the system should value peer education within families\n    And Kenji's student experience should benefit future student siblings\n\n  Scenario: Family cultural and value transmission across generations\n    Given Kenji learned family values and culture growing up\n    And he is now interpreting these in young adult context\n    When Kenji participates in family cultural practices\n    Then the family_elohim should recognize his work maintaining culture\n    And it should value his adaptation of family traditions to college life\n    And it should support intergenerational transmission of family values\n    And cultural work should be recognized as family care labor\n    And the system should value students as culture carriers\n    And family identity should persist across geographic separation\n\n  Scenario: Recognizing family investment as care economy transaction\n    Given Kenji's family invests time, money, and emotional energy in his development\n    And Kenji invests in family relationships and contributes what he can\n    When the family_elohim tracks family care economy\n    Then it should recognize mutual investment across generations\n    And it should value family support of student as care contribution\n    And it should value student's family participation as reciprocal care\n    And family economy should be understood as long-term reciprocal exchange\n    And the system should frame family support as investment in flourishing\n    And intergenerational care should be recognized as care economy foundation\n\n  Scenario: Student privacy rights within family context\n    Given Kenji is legal adult with full privacy rights\n    And family relationships involve some appropriate information sharing\n    When the family_elohim manages family information\n    Then Kenji must have complete control over what family sees\n    And parents should not have access to his personal data without consent\n    And the system should respect his adult autonomy absolutely\n    And family connection should not compromise privacy\n    And Kenji should decide what to share with family\n    And adult student privacy should be default, non-negotiable\n",
