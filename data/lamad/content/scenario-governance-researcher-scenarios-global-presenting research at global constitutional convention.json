  "content": "Scenario: Presenting research at Global Constitutional Convention\n    Given convention delegates need evidence to inform constitutional decisions\n    And I am invited to present research on sortition effectiveness\n    When I address 10,000 randomly-selected citizens from around the world\n    Then I summarize: what research shows about democratic AI governance\n    And I present: honestly about successes, failures, and uncertainties\n    And I explain: the superintelligence governance legitimacy question\n    And I acknowledge: the limits of my knowledge and research\n    And I clarify: that delegates must make values choices research cannot resolve\n    And I serve: democracy by informing not replacing citizen judgment\n    And My scholarship demonstrates: how expertise serves rather than dominates democracy\n",
