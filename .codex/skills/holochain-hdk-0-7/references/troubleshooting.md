# Troubleshooting

Keyed on the literal text the compiler, conductor or CLI prints. Search this page for the error you actually saw.

Entries marked **(verified)** were reproduced on Holochain 0.7.0 while building this skill's example hApp. The rest are drawn from the official 0.6 to 0.7 upgrade guide and the release CHANGELOG.

## Build and compile

| Error text | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `The wasm32-unknown-unknown targets are not supported by default; you may need to enable the "wasm_js" configuration flag` **(verified)** | Building zomes without the getrandom backend flag. The error names `getrandom`, not Holochain, so it reads like a dependency problem | `RUSTFLAGS='--cfg getrandom_backend="custom"' cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`. `npm run build:zomes` sets this for you |
| `cannot find type EntryCreationAction in this scope` | 0.6 code on 0.7 | `TypedAction<EntryCreationData>`. See `patterns.md` |
| `no variant named StoreEntry found for enum FlatOp` | 0.6 FlatOp names | `CreateEntry`. Full rename table in `patterns.md` |
| `no variant named RegisterCreateLink` / `RegisterDeleteLink` | Both folded into one variant in 0.7 | `FlatOp::Link(OpLink::CreateLink { .. })` |
| `no method named author found` on an action struct | The per-variant action structs are gone | `action.author()`, or `action.header.author`. Accessors exist on both `Action` and `TypedAction<D>` |
| `cannot move out of dereference` on a `TypedAction` field | `TypedAction<D>` derefs to its data; you cannot move through a deref | Use `.data` explicitly: `action.data.target_address.into_action_hash()` |
| `unresolved import holochain_zome_types::action::Action` | Crate-root and module re-exports were removed in 0.7 | Import from a prelude: `holochain_zome_types::prelude::Action`. Zomes importing only `hdi::prelude` / `hdk::prelude` are unaffected |
| `feature sqlite-encrypted does not exist` | Renamed in 0.7 | `encryption` |
| `feature wasmer_sys does not exist` | Renamed in 0.7 | `wasmer-sys-cranelift` |
| `feature transport-iroh does not exist` | Removed; iroh is compiled in unconditionally | Drop it from the feature list |
| Build fails looking for `perl` | A holochain build dependency needs it on PATH, usually surfacing only when building a Sweettest suite | Add `perl` to the `packages` list in `flake.nix` |
| `non-exhaustive patterns: AdminRequest::DumpOpTimings { .. } not covered`, raised **inside the `holochain` crate itself** **(verified)** | Version skew: the `holochain` crate is pinned to a `0.7.0-rc` while `holochain_conductor_api` resolves to stable `0.7.0`, which added the `DumpOpTimings` variant the rc does not handle. `hc scaffold` 0.700.0-rc emits exactly this combination | Pin `holochain` to stable `0.7.0` in `[workspace.dependencies]`, then `cargo update -p holochain`. Never leave the scaffolder's rc pins in place |
| `no method named agent found for &OpActivity<..>`, or `missing field agent` on `OpActivity::CreateAgent` **(verified)** | **Scaffolder output does not compile against stable 0.7.0.** `hc scaffold` 0.700.0-rc generates `ref create @ OpActivity::CreateAgent { ref action }` plus `create.agent()`, which matches the rc crates. Stable hdi 0.8.0 carries `agent` as a plain field, as the official upgrade guide documents | Match the field directly: `OpActivity::CreateAgent { agent, action } => { ... }` and drop the `create.agent()` block. `assets/templates/integrity-lib.rs` is already corrected |

## Scaffolding

### First, check which scaffolder you are running

```
hc scaffold --version
```

Holonix `main-0.7` bundles **`holochain_scaffolding_cli 0.700.0-rc.0`** (verified 2026-08-17 against the holonix `main-0.7` tip, rev `ffcc7c6`). The stable **v0.700.0** released 2026-07-31 and fixes every row in the rc block below. The bundled binary is the one you get by default, so most people hit these.

Install the stable scaffolder alongside holonix and use it instead:

```
nix run github:holochain/scaffolding/v0.700.0 -- web-app my-app
# or, once:
cargo install holochain_scaffolding_cli --version 0.700.0
```

Stable v0.700.0 emits `holonix?ref=main-0.7`, `nodejs_24`, and stable pins `hdi 0.8.0` / `hdk 0.7.0` / `holochain 0.7.0`, and its `validate()` codegen compiles against those crates.

### Applies to every scaffolder version

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Integrity zome "<name>" was not found in dna "<dna>"` **(verified)** | `--zome` takes the integrity crate's **package** name, not the directory name. `hc scaffold zome posts` creates directory `posts` with package `posts_integrity` | Pass `--zome posts_integrity` |
| `hc: command not found` inside `nix develop` | Wrong holonix branch, or the shell did not rebuild | Check the `ref` in `flake.nix`, then `nix flake update && nix develop` |

### Applies to `hc-scaffold 0.700.0-rc.0` only (the holonix-bundled binary)

Fixed in stable v0.700.0. If you are on stable and see one of these, something else is wrong.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Scaffolded `flake.nix` says `ref=main` **(verified)** | The rc emits `main`, and holonix `main` tracks the 0.8 dev line | Change to `ref=main-0.7` after scaffolding, then `nix flake update` |
| Scaffolded `flake.nix` says `nodejs_22` **(verified)** | Same stale template | Change to `nodejs_24` | <!-- legacy-ok -->
| Scaffolded `Cargo.toml` pins `-rc` crates **(verified)** | The scaffolding CLI is itself an rc and pins its own generation | Pin stable: `hdi = "=0.8.0"`, `hdk = "=0.7.0"`, `holochain = "0.7.0"` |

---

## Conductor startup

| Error / symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Conductor exits immediately after a 0.7 upgrade | `NetworkConfig` rejects unknown fields rather than ignoring them | Remove `signal_url` and `webrtc_config`. Move `request_timeout_s` under `network`. Rename `db_sync_strategy` to `db_sync_level` (`Full`/`Normal`/`Off`; old `Resilient` maps to `Normal`, `Fast` to `Off`). Remove `chc_url` |
| Conductor cannot read existing databases | 0.7 renamed its databases and there is no migration path | `hc sandbox clean`. Expected, not a bug |
| Peers never connect after upgrading | DNA hashes changed in 0.7 even for otherwise identical DNAs, so you are on a new network | Everyone must be on the same build. Republish the DNA hash to your users |
| `hc sandbox` rejects the network type | Only `mem` and `quic` remain; `webrtc` is gone with tx5 | Update scripts passing `webrtc` |
| App manifest rejected for an unrecognised field | App and web-app manifests now reject unknown fields | Remove stray or misspelled keys. `manifest_version` is `'0'` |

---

## Validation

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Validation passes locally, fails for other agents | Non-deterministic validation: a `get()` or `get_links()` in a coordinator helper called from validation, `agent_info()`, `sys_time()`, or `get_init_properties()` | Validation may only inspect the op and what `must_get_*` returns. See `patterns.md` |
| A progenitor check works for the installer and nobody else | Reading `init_properties` instead of `modifiers.properties`. Init properties are conductor-local and invisible to other peers | Use `dna_info().modifiers.properties`. See `progenitor.md` |
| An entry fails to deserialize after a schema change | A field was added without `#[serde(default)]` | `Option<T>` alone is not sufficient. Add `#[serde(default)]` |
| `WrongActionError` from a narrowing conversion | The action was not the variant sys validation guarantees | Propagate with `?`, do not return `Invalid`. It is a fault, not bad author data |

---

## Testing

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-agent read returns `None` intermittently | Missing consistency wait | `await_consistency([&alice_cell, &bob_cell]).await.unwrap()` before every cross-agent read. `await_consistency_s(n, ..)` for a custom timeout |
| Suites over roughly 8 tests hang or flake | Too many in-process conductors at once | `cargo test -- --test-threads 6` |
| `Conductor::install_app_with_manifest` not found | Moved behind a feature in 0.7 | Enable the `test_utils` feature |
| `mock_network` not found | Removed from `holochain_p2p` in 0.7 | Use `test_utils` directly |
| Inline zome tests fail to compile | Inline zome definitions are no longer embedded in `DnaDef`; closures live on `DnaFile`, and `InlineZome::uuid` became `InlineZome::hash` | Rework against the 0.7 inline zome API |

---

## Deployment

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Kangaroo build uses the wrong conductor | Cloned the default branch | `git checkout main-0.7`. `main-0.7` pins holochain 0.7.0; `main-0.6` pins 0.6.3 |
| App will not start after a version bump | Kangaroo isolates data folders on minor and major bumps by design | Expected. Only patch bumps share a data folder |
| Windows MSI build fails | Special characters in `PRODUCT_NAME` | Alphanumerics and hyphens only |
