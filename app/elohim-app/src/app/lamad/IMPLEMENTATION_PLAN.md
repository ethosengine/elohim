### Quick Start

```bash
# Generate data
python scripts/generate_lamad_data.py

# Serve app
ng serve

# Key routes
/lamad                              → Path-centric home
/lamad/path/elohim-protocol         → Path overview
/lamad/path/elohim-protocol/step/0  → Step navigation
/lamad/explore                      → Graph explorer
/lamad/resource/:id                 → Direct content access (with back-links)
```

---

## Architectural Principles

### Lazy Loading is Non-Negotiable
Content is fetched by ID, one node at a time. Path metadata loads without loading step content. No service method returns "all nodes."

### Data Structures Mirror Holochain Entries
Every JSON structure translates directly to a Holochain entry type. IDs are opaque strings (become action hashes), no circular references.

### Path-Centric Navigation
Path-centric navigation (step progression with narrative) is primary. Graph exploration is secondary discovery.

### Territory and Journey Separation
Content nodes (Territory) exist independently of paths (Journey). Same content can appear in multiple paths.

### Human-Centered Terminology
We use "human" not "user" throughout the codebase. This aligns with Elohim Protocol principles and the Imago Dei framework - recognizing the dignity and agency of every person who engages with the platform.

### Phase 13: Session Human ✅
Zero-friction entry with Holochain upgrade path.

- **SessionUser model** (`session-human.model.ts`):
  - `SessionUser` - temporary identity with sessionId, displayName, stats
  - `SessionStats` - engagement metrics (nodesViewed, pathsStarted, pathsCompleted)
  - `SessionActivity` - activity history for timeline
  - `SessionPathProgress` - path progress with notes
  - `HolochainUpgradePrompt` - contextual upgrade suggestions
  - `UpgradeTrigger` - meaningful moments (first-affinity, path-completed, etc.)
  - `SessionMigration` - data package for Holochain transition

- **Content Access model** (`content-access.model.ts`):
  - `AccessLevel`: visitor → member → attested
  - `ContentAccessLevel`: open → gated → protected
  - `ContentAccessMetadata` - per-content access requirements
  - `AccessCheckResult` - detailed access denial with actions
  - `ACCESS_PRESETS` - common configurations

- **SessionUserService** (`session-user.service.ts`):
  - Session lifecycle: create, restore, touch
  - Activity tracking: views, affinity, path progress
  - Content access control: `checkContentAccess()`, `canAccessContent()`
  - Upgrade prompts: contextual triggers, dismiss, active list
  - Migration: `prepareMigration()`, `clearAfterMigration()`

- **Service Integration**:
  - `AffinityTrackingService` - session-scoped storage keys
  - `AgentService` - delegates identity to session, access checks
  - `LamadLayoutComponent` - session human UI, upgrade banner, modal

### Phase 14: Human Profile (Imago Dei) ✅
Human-centered identity view aligned with Imago Dei framework.

- **Profile model** (`profile.model.ts`):
  - `HumanProfile` - core identity + growth indicators (imagodei-core)
  - `JourneyStats` - growth-oriented metrics (not consumption)
  - `CurrentFocus` - active learning paths (imagodei-experience)
  - `DevelopedCapability` - attestations earned (imagodei-gifts)
  - `TimelineEvent` - significant moments (imagodei-experience)
  - `ContentEngagement` - meaningful encounters (imagodei-synthesis)
  - `NoteWithContext` - personal reflections (imagodei-synthesis)
  - `ResumePoint` - smart continuation suggestion
  - `PathWithProgress`, `PathsOverview` - organized path views

- **ProfileService** (`profile.service.ts`):
  - `getProfile()` - complete identity view
  - `getProfileSummary()` - compact header/card display
  - `getJourneyStats()` - aggregated growth metrics
  - `getCurrentFocus()` - paths in progress
  - `getDevelopedCapabilities()` - earned attestations
  - `getTimeline()` - transformation events
  - `getTopEngagedContent()` - high-affinity content
  - `getAllNotes()` - personal reflections with context
  - `getResumePoint()` - smart "continue here" suggestion
  - `getPathsOverview()` - in-progress, completed, suggested

### Phase 16: Relational Maps ✅
Four-dimensional knowledge map architecture for holistic growth.

- **Knowledge Map model expanded** (`knowledge-map.model.ts`):
  - `KnowledgeMapType` - Now four types: domain, self, person, collective
  - `SelfKnowledgeMap` - "Know thyself" (γνῶθι σεαυτόν) reflexive map
  - `ImagoDeiDimension` - Core/experience/gifts/synthesis facets
  - `PersonalValue` - Values hierarchy with priority ranking
  - `LifeChapter` - Narrative structure of personal history
  - `DiscoveredGift` - Strengths uncovered through self-examination
  - `ShadowArea` - Growth areas and blind spots (honest self-awareness)
  - `VocationalClarity` - Calling, purpose, gift-to-need alignment
  - `DomainReflection` - How domain learning reveals the self

Theological grounding: "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Mark 12:31)
implies three loves: God, neighbor, and self. Self-knowledge is prerequisite
to loving others well.

The four relational dimensions:
1. **Domain** - What do I know? (relationship with ideas)
2. **Self** - Who am I? (relationship with self)
3. **Person** - Who do I know? (relationship with others - Gottman love maps)
4. **Collective** - What do we know? (relationship with communities)

### Phase 17: Psychometric Assessments ✅
Scientifically validated self-knowledge with research contribution and Elohim guidance.

- **Assessment Architecture** (`knowledge-map.model.ts`):
  - `AssessmentInstrument` - Validated psychometric tools with reliability/validity data
  - `AssessmentDomain` - 12 domains: personality, attachment, EQ, values, strengths, relationship, wellbeing, spiritual, vocational, cognitive, trauma, family-systems
  - `AssessmentResult` - Completed assessments with raw scores, interpretation, quality metrics
  - `AssessmentInterpretation` - Human-readable results with subscales, strengths, growth areas
  - `LongitudinalChange` - Track changes over time for repeated assessments
  - `SelfKnowledgeLink` - How assessments inform dimensions, values, gifts, shadows, vocation
  - `ResponseQuality` - Detect rushed/inconsistent responses

- **Assessments as Attributable Content**:
  - `InstrumentContributor` - Contributors who developed/validated instruments (uses ContributorPresence)
  - `ContributorRole` - original-author, validator, adapter, translator, normer, digitizer, curator, elohim-synthesizer
  - `InstrumentDerivation` - Track when instruments derive from prior work
  - `InstrumentRecognitionModel` - Recognition flows when instrument is used
  - Contributors earn recognition for: completions, citations, validation work

- **Assessments as Learning Paths**:
  - `AssessmentPathStructure` - Pre-assessment → Instrument → Post-assessment
  - `InstrumentSection` - Questions organized into meaningful sections
  - `AssessmentQuestion` - Full question model with types (likert, multiple-choice, ranking, etc.)
  - `AssessmentAttestation` - Attestations granted upon completion
  - `AssessmentAttestationType` - self-knowledge, domain-exploration, pattern-awareness, growth-commitment, longitudinal, research-contributor, instrument-certified
  - `AssessmentPrerequisite` - Prerequisites for sensitive assessments

- **Pattern Detection** (Elohim guidance):
  - `PatternAlert` - Detected patterns requiring attention (anxiety, distress, growth opportunity)
  - `PatternType` - 9 types: anxiety-elevation, depression-indicators, relationship-distress, attachment-activation, burnout-risk, value-conflict, growth-opportunity, blind-spot-revealed, longitudinal-shift
  - `SuggestedAction` - Recommended responses: learning paths, assessments, professional help
  - `CrisisProtocol` - Safety net for serious concerns (NOT diagnosis, but resources)

- **Research Contribution** (data sovereignty):
  - `ResearchConsent` - Human-controlled contribution with scope options
  - `ResearchConsentScope` - none, aggregate-only, anonymized, identifiable
  - `ContributionRecognition` - REA recognition for research participation
  - Privacy model: raw data on private source chain, anonymized contributions use differential privacy

Three purposes of assessments:
1. **Self-Knowledge** - Scientifically validated insights about oneself
2. **Contribution** - Anonymized data for research (with consent) earns recognition
3. **Elohim Guidance** - Pattern detection enables personalized growth paths

Example flow: Human takes attachment assessment → Results reveal anxious attachment → Elohim gently suggests "Attachment Repair" learning path → Human's growth contributes to research (if consented) → Research advances understanding of attachment patterns in distributed communities.

Attribution example: Dr. Kim Bartholomew (unclaimed ContributorPresence) developed the ECR-R → Community member adapts it for faith context → Both earn recognition when someone completes → If Dr. Bartholomew claims her presence, accumulated recognition transfers.

### Phase 18: Governance & Feedback ✅
Constitutional moderation system - the protocol's immune system.

"In systems theory every system needs meaningful feedback or it goes chaotic." - Destin Sandlin

- **Governance State** (`governance-feedback.model.ts`):
  - `GovernableEntityType` - Everything is governable: content, paths, assessments, contributors, humans, even Elohim
  - `GovernanceState` - Every entity has status, labels, reviews, challenges, restrictions
  - `GovernanceStatus` - Lifecycle: unreviewed → reviewed → challenged → restricted/restored
  - `StatusBasis` - Transparent reasoning for every status decision

- **Labels (Taxonomy of Concerns)**:
  - `LabelType` - 25 label types covering quality, safety, policy, positive markers
  - `LabelSeverity` - Graduated: informational → advisory → warning → critical → emergency
  - `LabelEvidence` - All labels must have evidence
  - Labels are CHALLENGEABLE, not absolute

- **Reviews**:
  - `ReviewRecord` - Who reviewed, what type, outcome, recommendations
  - `ReviewType` - initial, periodic, triggered, appeal, precedent, meta
  - Reviews have quality scores (meta-review the reviewers)

- **Challenges (The Right to Contest)**:
  - `Challenge` - EVERY decision can be challenged (constitutional right)
  - `ChallengeStanding` - content-owner, affected-party, community-member, public-interest
  - `ChallengeGrounds` - 10 grounds: factual-error, misapplication, bias, inconsistency, etc.
  - `ChallengeState` - Lifecycle with SLA guarantees
  - System MUST respond within SLA - silence is not an option

- **Appeals (Escalation Path)**:
  - `Appeal` - Escalation to higher Elohim level
  - `ElohimLevel` - individual → family → community → network → constitutional
  - `AppealDecision` - Can affirm, reverse, modify, or remand
  - Appeals create PRECEDENT (unlike Facebook's ad-hoc moderation)

- **Precedent (Constitutional Evolution)**:
  - `Precedent` - Decisions inform future decisions
  - `PrecedentBinding` - persuasive, binding-local, binding-network, constitutional
  - `PrecedentScope` - What does this precedent apply to?
  - Creates predictable, fair governance over time

- **Voting**:
  - `GovernanceVote` - Collective decision-making
  - `VotingMechanism` - simple-majority, supermajority, ranked-choice, quadratic, conviction, consent
  - `QuorumRequirement` - Ensures legitimacy
  - Democratic input into governance decisions

- **Feedback Loop Metrics (System Health)**:
  - `GovernanceFeedbackMetrics` - Track response times, outcomes, consistency
  - `GovernanceRedFlag` - Detect system dysfunction early
  - If metrics go bad, the system is going chaotic

- **SLA Guarantees**:
  - `GovernanceSLA` - Constitutional response time requirements
  - Default: 1hr acknowledgment, 3 days initial response, 14 days resolution
  - Breach consequences: auto-escalate, default-favor-challenger, public-report
  - **No more "Help me get 16 years of my life back" with no response**

Key difference from Facebook/Meta:
- Every decision is challengeable
- Every challenge gets a response (SLA-guaranteed)
- Precedent builds predictable governance
- Feedback metrics detect dysfunction
- Power is distributed (Elohim hierarchy)
- Constitutional rights, not discretionary policies

### Phase 19: Governance Deliberation ✅
Deliberation infrastructure extending the governance/feedback system.

Inspired by:
- **Loomio**: Structured proposals (advice, consent, consensus, sense-check) with graduated feedback
- **Polis**: AI-powered opinion clustering, bridging statement detection
- **Wikipedia**: Talk pages, edit history, protection logs for audit trails

- **Governance Deliberation model** (`governance-deliberation.model.ts`):
  - `GovernanceContextMenu` - Entry point to governance dimension for any entity
  - `GovernanceQuickAction` - Quick actions: flag, discuss, challenge, vote, review
  - `GovernanceAlert` - Notifications: vote-open, challenge-pending, sla-warning

- **Graduated Feedback** (Loomio-inspired):
  - `GraduatedFeedbackSelector` - Context-aware feedback component
  - `FeedbackContext` - What's being evaluated: accuracy, usefulness, proposal-position, etc.
  - `FeedbackOption` - Graduated options with optional reasoning requirements
  - `FeedbackResponse` - User response with reasoning (required for negative feedback)
  - `FeedbackAggregateView` - Distribution, consensus strength, bridging opportunities
  - Pre-defined `FEEDBACK_SCALES` for different contexts

- **Deliberation Proposals**:
  - `DeliberationProposal` - Structured proposal for collective decision
  - `ProposalType` - advice, consent, consensus, sense-check, ranked-choice, dot-vote, score-vote
  - `ProposalPhase` - draft → discussion → voting → closed → decided → implemented
  - `VotingConfiguration` - Mechanism, options, quorum, passage threshold
  - `ProposalResults` - Tallied results with participation rate, blocks, recommendation
  - `ProposalOutcome` - Final decision with reasoning and actions triggered

- **Sensemaking** (Polis-inspired):
  - `SensemakingVisualization` - Opinion clustering display
  - `OpinionCluster` - Group with characteristic statements and centroid position
  - `ConsensusStatement` - Statements with cross-cluster agreement (bridging)
  - `DivisiveStatement` - High-variance statements showing disagreement
  - `ClusterVisualizationData` - 2D projection (PCA/t-SNE/UMAP) for rendering
  - `BridgingOpportunity` - Cross-group agreement worth surfacing

- **Governance History** (Wikipedia-inspired):
  - `GovernanceHistoryView` - Full audit trail with tabbed interface

### Phase 20: Feedback Profile - Virality as Privilege ✅
Feedback mechanisms as gated privileges - orthogonal to ContentReach.

Core insight: **"Virality is a privilege, not an entitlement."**

- **Feedback Profile model** (`feedback-profile.model.ts`):
  - `FeedbackMechanism` - Types of engagement (NO "LIKES"):
    - Low friction: `approval-vote`, `emotional-reaction`, `affinity-mark`
    - Medium friction: `graduated-usefulness`, `graduated-accuracy`, `share-with-context`
    - High friction: `proposal-vote`, `challenge`, `discussion-only`, `citation`, `peer-review`
    - None: `view-only`
  - `FeedbackProfile` - Governs what mechanisms are permitted for content
  - `ProfileEvolution` - Upgrade AND downgrade (intellectual humility, Micah 6:8)
  - `ProfileChangeTrigger` - What causes changes (attestation, peer-review, new-research, author-retraction)

- **Emotional Reactions (NOT Facebook reactions)**:
  - `EmotionalReactionType` - Contextual responses:
    - Supportive: `moved`, `grateful`, `inspired`, `hopeful`, `grieving`
    - Critical: `challenged`, `concerned`, `uncomfortable`
  - `EmotionalReactionConstraints` - Guards against "tyranny of the laughing emoji"
  - `MediatedReaction` - Elohim intercepts harmful reactions with teaching rather than blocking
  - `MediatedReactionBehavior` - What happens if user proceeds (not visible to author, logged for monitoring)

- **Key Design Decisions**:
  - **No "likes"** - Replaced with approval voting (up/down) minimum
  - **Path inheritance** - Most restrictive profile wins
  - **Dynamic profiles** - Upgrade through trust-building, downgrade through new evidence
  - **Mediated reactions** - Teach rather than block; user can proceed but author won't see

- **ContentNode enhancement**:
  - Added `feedbackProfileId` and `permittedFeedbackMechanisms` fields

- **Elohim capabilities**:
  - `feedback-profile-negotiation`, `feedback-profile-enforcement`
  - `feedback-profile-upgrade`, `feedback-profile-downgrade`

- **API routes** (Specification 1.10):
  - `/lamad/{entityType}:{entityId}/feedback-profile` - View/manage profile
  - `/lamad/{entityType}:{entityId}/reactions` - Emotional reactions
  - Profile upgrade requests with justification

### Phase 21: Cohesion Review ✅
Model standardization and documentation alignment.

**Issues Addressed:**

1. **Duplicate Type Names Resolved**:
   - `ContentAccessRequirement` in `attestations.model.ts` → renamed to `AttestationAccessRequirement`
   - Now clearly distinguished from `ContentAccessRequirement` in `content-access.model.ts`
   - `AttestationAccessRequirement`: What ATTESTATIONS unlock (earned credentials → content)
   - `ContentAccessRequirement`: What ACCESS LEVEL is required (visitor/member/attested)

2. **Date Field Standardization**:
   - All timestamp fields now use ISO 8601 string format (not Date objects)
   - Files updated: `attestations.model.ts`, `human-affinity.model.ts`, `content-node.model.ts`
   - Rationale: JSON serialization, Holochain compatibility, timezone safety

3. **Index.ts Documentation**:
   - Enhanced barrel export with six-layer architecture summary
   - Clear distinction between three attestation models documented
   - Date field convention noted
   - Governance layer added to architecture summary

4. **API Specification Updated** (v1.1):
   - Added "Technical Conventions" section
   - Date field convention documented
   - Attestation model distinction table added

**Files Modified:**
- `attestations.model.ts` - Renamed type, fixed date fields
- `human-affinity.model.ts` - Fixed date fields
- `content-node.model.ts` - Fixed date fields
- `models/index.ts` - Enhanced documentation
- `LAMAD_API_SPECIFICATION_v1.0.md` - Added technical conventions

### Phase 15: REA Economic Models ✅

- **REA Bridge model** (`rea-bridge.model.ts`):
  - `REAAction` - ValueFlows action vocabulary (use, cite, produce, transfer, accept)
  - `ResourceSpecification` - Resource type definitions (content, attention, recognition, credential)
  - `EconomicResource` - Current state derived from event history
  - `REAAgent` - Extended agent type including `contributor-presence`
  - `Process` - Learning paths as value-creating transformations
  - `Commitment` / `Intent` - Future flows and promises
  - `Agreement` - Governance documents and contracts
  - `Appreciation` / `Claim` - Recognition flows and entitlements

- **Contributor Presence model** (`contributor-presence.model.ts`):

  - `AccumulatedRecognition` - Value awaiting the contributor
  - `PresenceStewardship` - Elohim care record with activities
  - `PresenceInvitation` - Outreach to contributors
  - `PresenceClaim` - Verification and transfer process
  - `NestedStewardshipOffer` - Claimed contributors stewarding others

- **Economic Event model** (`economic-event.model.ts`):
  - `EconomicEvent` - Core REA event (provider, receiver, action, resource)
  - `LamadEventType` - 25 Lamad-specific event types
  - `createEventFromRequest()` - Helper for typed event creation
  - `EventQuery` - Search/filter events
  - `AgentEventLedger` - Agent-perspective view
  - `NetworkEconomicMetrics` - System-wide transparency metrics
  - `hREAEventAdapter` / `UnytEventAdapter` - Integration interfaces

## Holochain Migration Notes

When transitioning from JSON prototype to Holochain:

1. **DataLoaderService** is the only service that knows about the data source
2. Replace HTTP calls with Holochain conductor calls
3. IDs become action hashes
4. **SessionUserService.prepareMigration()** packages session data for transfer
5. Progress moves from localStorage to agent's private source chain
6. Attestations become DHT entries with cryptographic verification
7. Reach enforcement moves from client to conductor validation
8. Network membership replaces "visitor" access level

### hREA Integration

When integrating with hREA (Holochain REA):

1. **EconomicEvent** maps directly to hREA zome entries via GraphQL API
2. **ContributorPresence** uses hREA Agent with custom extension fields
3. Recognition transfer on claim uses countersigned events
4. **hREAEventAdapter** interface defines the translation layer
5. Resource specifications align with ValueFlows vocabulary

### Unyt Integration

When integrating with Unyt/HoloFuel:

1. **UnytEventAdapter** interface handles mutual credit transactions
2. Currency events use `credit-issue`, `credit-transfer`, `credit-retire` types
3. Credit limits based on contribution metrics (learning, stewardship)
4. Countersigned transactions for value transfers

## Identity Architecture

### Access Levels

```
visitor (session human)
    ↓ Install Holochain app
member (network identity)
    ↓ Earn attestations
attested (credentialed member)
```

### Content Access Tiers

| Tier | Who Can Access | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `open` | Anyone (visitor+) | Public documentation |
| `gated` | Members only | Community discussions |
| `protected` | Attested members with path completion | CSAM handling training |

### Session-to-Network Flow

1. Human explores freely as visitor (session identity)
2. Meaningful moments trigger upgrade prompts
3. Human installs Holochain app
4. `prepareMigration()` packages session data
5. Session data imports to agent's source chain
6. `clearAfterMigration()` removes localStorage
7. Human continues with full network identity

## Relational Map Architecture

### The Four Maps ("Know Thyself" + "Love Thy Neighbor")

Learning is fundamentally about building relationship. Lamad supports four types of knowledge maps, each representing a different relational dimension:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     DOMAIN MAPS                                  │
│           "What do I know?" (relationship with ideas)           │
│    Khan Academy style: World of Math, Elohim Protocol          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                       SELF MAPS                                  │
│          "Who am I?" (γνῶθι σεαυτόν - know thyself)             │
│    Imago Dei dimensions: core, experience, gifts, synthesis     │
│    Values hierarchy, life chapters, discovered gifts            │
│    Shadow areas (honest growth), vocational clarity             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      PERSON MAPS                                 │
│       "Who do I know?" (relationship with others)               │
│    Gottman Love Maps: spouse, family, friends, mentors          │
│    Categories: life history, values, dreams, love language      │
│    Consent-based access, reciprocal mapping                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    COLLECTIVE MAPS                               │
│       "What do we know?" (relationship with communities)        │
│    Organizational knowledge, team intelligence                   │
│    Governance: steward-only, consensus, open                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Self-Knowledge Integration

Self-knowledge maps integrate with the HumanProfile (Imago Dei framework):

| Imago Dei Dimension | Self-Map Integration |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| imagodei-core | Stable identity, "I am" statements |
| imagodei-experience | Life chapters, formative events |
| imagodei-gifts | Discovered gifts, strengths |
| imagodei-synthesis | Meaning-making, growth narrative |

### Domain Reflections

When learning from domain maps, self-discovery happens naturally:
- What topics energize me? (points to gifts)
- What do I resist learning? (points to shadow areas)
- How does this connect to my calling? (vocational clarity)

This creates a feedback loop between domain learning and self-understanding.

## Economic Architecture (REA)

### Contributor Presence Lifecycle

```
UNCLAIMED ──────────► STEWARDED ──────────► CLAIMED
   │                      │                     │
   │ Content              │ Elohim begins       │ Contributor verifies
   │ referenced,          │ active care,        │ identity, claims
   │ presence             │ recognition         │ their presence
   │ auto-created         │ accumulates         │
   │                      │                     │
   ▼                      ▼                     ▼
Recognition           Recognition           Recognition flows
accumulates →         accumulates →         directly to
at presence           with invitation       contributor agent
                      queue
```

### Value Flow Events

| Event Type | Action | Resource | Description |
|------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `content-view` | use | attention | Human viewed content |
| `affinity-mark` | raise | recognition | Human marked affinity |
| `citation` | cite | recognition | Content cited another |
| `path-complete` | produce | credential | Human completed path |
| `presence-claim` | accept | recognition | Contributor claimed presence |
| `recognition-transfer` | transfer | recognition | Recognition transferred on claim |

### Recognition Economics

From the Economic Epic (Beer's Cybersyn on P2P):
- Recognition flows to contributor presences even before they join
- Elohim steward presences with constitutional accountability
- Claiming transfers accumulated recognition to verified identity
- The attractor: more valuable to participate than to extract
