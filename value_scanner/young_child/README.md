# Young Child - Value Scanner

## Archetype

A child in the Pure Discovery phase (ages 5-7), experiencing wonder and making choices with parental oversight. This user type represents early-stage value formation and the beginning of autonomous decision-making within a protective family context.

## Core Needs

- **Wonder Preservation**: Maintain natural curiosity and joy in discovery
- **Parental Oversight**: Safe exploration with guardian verification
- **Age-Appropriate Choice**: Developmentally suitable decision-making opportunities
- **Privacy Protection**: Family-controlled data boundaries
- **Trust Building**: Positive early experiences with technology and choice

## Key Relationships

- **parent**: Primary guardian with verification rights
- **family_elohim**: Personal agent providing age-appropriate guidance
- **caregiver**: Extended care providers (grandparents, teachers)
- **community**: Limited, supervised interaction at neighborhood level

## Relevant Governance Layers

### Geographic/Political
- **individual**: Personal choices (snacks, toys, preferences)
- **family**: Family values override individual impulses
- **neighborhood**: Limited community interaction (playground, local store)

### Functional
- **educational**: Early learning environment
- **ecological_bioregional**: Age-appropriate environmental awareness

## Implementation Notes

All scenarios for this user type should emphasize:
- Parental verification and oversight mechanisms
- Age-appropriate interface design
- Privacy-first data handling
- Wonder preservation vs. manipulation protection
- Gradual autonomy development
